卻說曹丕見二婦人啼哭，拔劍欲斬之。忽見紅光滿目，遂按劍而問曰：「汝何人也？」一婦人告曰：「妾乃袁將軍之妻劉氏也。」丕曰：「此女何人？」劉氏曰：「此次男袁熙之妻甄氏也。因熙出鎮幽州，甄氏不肯遠行，故留於此。」,"As was said, Cao Pi, having made his way into the Yuans' palace, saw two women there whom he was about to kill. Suddenly a red light shone in his eyes, and he paused.Lowering his sword he said, ""Who are you?""""Thy handmaid is the widow of the late Yuan Shao, Lady Liu,"" said the elder of the two, ""and this is the wife of Yuan Xi, his second son. She was of the Zhen family. When Yuan Xi was sent to command in Youzhou, her family objected to her going so far from home and she stayed behind."""
丕拖此女近前，見披髮垢面。丕以衫袖拭其面而觀之，見甄氏玉肌花貌，有傾國之色。遂對劉氏曰：「吾乃曹丞相之子也。願保汝家，汝勿憂慮。」遂按劍坐於堂上。,"Cao Pi drew Lady Zhen toward him and looked at her closely. Her hair hung disordered, her face was dusty and tear-stained, but when, with the sleeve of his inner garment, he had wiped sway these disfigurements, he saw a woman of exquisite loveliness, with a complexion clear as jade touched with the tender bloom of a flower petal, a woman indeed beautiful enough to ruin a kingdom.""I am the son of the Prime Minister,"" said he turning to the elder woman.""I will guarantee your safety, so you need fear nothing.""He then put by his sword and sat down at the upper end of the room."
卻說曹操統領眾將，入冀州城，將入城門，許攸縱馬近前，以鞭指城門呼操曰：「阿瞞，汝不得我，安得入此門？」操大笑。眾將聞言，俱懷不平。操至紹府門下，問曰：「誰曾入此門來？」守將對曰：「世子在內。」操喚出責之。劉氏出拜曰：「非世子不能保全妾家，願獻甄氏為世子執箕帚。」操教喚出甄氏拜於前。操視之曰：「真吾兒婦也！」遂令曹丕納之。,"As Cao Cao was entering the gate of the conquered city of Yejun, Xu You rode up very quickly, passed him, and pointed with his whip at the gate, saying, ""Sir Prime Minister, you would not have been here but for my plans!""Cao Cao laughed, but his generals were very annoyed.When Cao Cao reached the residence, he stopped at the gate and asked, ""Has anyone had gone in?""The guard at the gate said, ""Your son is within.""Cao Cao called him out and chided him, but the wife of the late Imperial Protector interposed, saying, ""But not for your son we had not been saved. I desire to present to you a lady, of the Zhen family, as a handmaid to your son.""Cao Cao bade them bring out the girl and she bowed before him. After looking at her intently, he said, ""Just the wife for him!""And he told Cao Pi to take Lady Zhen to wife."
操既定冀州，親往袁紹墓下設祭，再拜而哭甚哀，顧謂眾將曰：「昔日吾與本初共起兵時，本初問我曰：『若事不濟，方面何所可據？』吾問之曰：『足下意欲若何？』本初曰：『吾南據河北，阻燕代，兼沙漠之眾，南向以爭天下，庶可以濟乎？』吾答曰：『吾任天下之智力，以道御之，無所不可。』此言如昨，而今本初已喪，吾不能不為流涕也！」眾皆歎息。操以金帛糧米賜紹妻劉氏。乃下令曰：「河北居民遭兵革之難，盡免今年租賦。」一面寫表申奏朝廷；操自領冀州牧。,"After the conquest of Jizhou had been made quite sure, Cao Cao made a ceremonial visit to the Yuan family cemetery, where he sacrificed at the tomb of his late rival, bowed his head, and lamented bitterly.Turning to his generals, he said, ""Not long ago when Yuan Shao and I worked together in military matters, he asked me, saying, 'If this disturbance does not cease, what fronts should be held?' And I replied asking him what he thought.He said, 'In the North of Yellow River, to the south I would hold the Yellow River; on the north, guard against Yan and Dai and absorb the hordes from the Gobi Desert. Thence southward I would try for the empire, and do you not think I might succeed?' I replied saying, 'I depend upon the wisdom and force of the world directed by scholars; then every thing would be possible.' These words seem as if spoken only yesterday, and now he is gone. Thinking over it I cannot refrain from tears.""His officers were deeply affected. Cao Cao treated the widow generously, giving her gold and silks and food to her content.He also issued a further order that the taxes in the North of Yellow River would be remitted in consideration of the sufferings of the people during the warlike operations. He sent up a memorial to the Throne and formally became Imperial Protector of Jizhou."
一日，許褚走馬入東門，正迎許攸。攸喚褚曰：「汝等無我，安能出入此門乎？」褚怒曰：「吾等千生萬死，身冒血戰，奪得城池，汝安敢誇口！」攸罵曰：「汝等皆匹夫耳，何足道哉！」褚大怒，拔劍殺攸，提頭來見曹操，說許攸如此無禮，某殺之矣。操曰：「子遠與吾舊交，故相戲耳。何故殺之？」深責許褚，令厚葬許攸。乃令人遍訪冀州賢士。冀民曰：「騎都尉崔琰，字季珪，清河東武城人也。數曾獻計於袁紹，紹不從，因此託疾在家。」,"One day Xu Chu, riding in at the east gate, met Xu You, who called out to him, ""Would you fellows be riding through here if it had not been for me?""Xu Chu replied, ""We fellows, those who survive and those who perished, risked our lives in bloody battle to get this city, so do not brag of your deeds!""""You are a lot of blockheads, not worth talking about,"" said Xu You.Xu Chu in his anger drew his sword and ran Xu You through. Then he took Xu You's head and went to tell Cao Cao the reason.Said Cao Cao, ""He and I were old friends, and we could joke together. Why did you kill him?""Cao Cao blamed Xu Chu very severely and gave orders that Xu You should be buried honorably. Cao Cao inquired for any wise and reputable people who were known to be living in the region and was told: ""Commander Cui Yan, of Dongwu, who had on many occasions given valuable advice to Yuan Shao. As the advice was not followed, he had pleaded indisposition and remained at home."""
操即召琰為本州別駕從事，因謂曰：「昨按本州戶籍，共計三十萬眾，可謂大州。」琰曰：「今天下分崩，九州幅裂，二袁兄弟相爭，冀民暴骨原野，丞相不急存問風俗，救其塗炭，而先計校戶籍，豈本州士女所望於明公哉？」,"Cao Cao sent for this man, gave him an office and said to him, ""According to the former registers, there are three hundred thousand households in the region so that one may well call it a major region.""Cui Yan replied, ""The empire is rent, and the country is torn; the Yuan brothers are at war, and the people have been stripped naked. Yet, Sir, you do not hasten to inquire after local conditions and how to rescue the people from misery, but first compute the possibilities of taxation. Can you expect to gain the support of our people by such means?"""
操聞言，改容謝之，待為上賓。操已定冀州，使人探袁譚消息。時譚引兵劫掠甘陵、安平、渤海、河間等處，聞袁尚敗走中山，乃統軍攻之。尚無心於戰鬥，逕奔幽州投袁熙。譚盡降其眾，欲復圖冀州。操使人召之，譚不至。操大怒，馳書絕其婚，自統大軍征之，直抵平原。,"Cao Cao accepted the rebuke, changed the policy, thanked him, and treated him all the better for it.As soon as Jizhou was settled, Cao Cao sent to find out the movements of Yuan Tan. He heard Yuan Tan was ravaging Ganling, Anping, Bohai, and Hejian. Moreover, the scouts brought the news that Yuan Shang had fled to Zhongshan, and Yuan Tan led an expedition against him, but Yuan Shang would not face a battle. He had gone away to Youzhou to his brother Yuan Xi. Yuan Tan, having gathered Yuan Shang's troops, prepared for another attempt on Jizhou.Whereupon Cao Cao summoned him. Yuan Tan refused to come, and Cao Cao sent letters breaking off the marriage between Yuan Tan and his daughter. Soon after Cao Cao led an expedition against Yuan Tan and marched to Pingyuan."
譚聞操自統軍來，遣人求救於劉表。表請玄德商議。玄德曰：「今操已破冀州，兵勢正盛，袁氏兄弟，不久必為操擒，救之無益；況操常有窺荊、襄之意，我只養兵自守，未可妄動。」表曰：「然則何以謝之？」玄德曰：「可作書與袁氏兄弟，以和解為名，婉詞謝之。」,"Yuan Tan sent to Liu Biao to beg assistance. Liu Biao sent for Liu Bei to consult about this.Liu Bei said, ""Cao Cao is very strong now that he has overcome Jizhou, and the Yuans will be unable to hold out for long. Nothing is to be gained by helping Yuan Tan, and it may give Cao Cao the loophole he is always looking for to attack this place. My advice is to keep the army in condition and devote all our energies to defense.""""Agreed; but what shall we say?"" said Liu Biao.""Write to both the brothers as peacemaker in gracious terms."""
表然其言，先遣人以書遺譚。書略曰：,Accordingly Liu Biao wrote thus to Yuan Tan:
君子違難，不適讎國。日前聞君屈膝降曹，則是忘先人之，棄手足之誼，而遺同盟之恥矣。若「冀州」不弟，當降心相從。待事定之後，使天下平其曲直，不亦高義耶？,"""When the superior person would escape danger, that person does not go to an enemy state. I heard recently that you had crooked the knee to Cao Cao, which was ignoring the enmity between him and your father, rejecting the duties of brotherhood, and leaving behind you the shame of an alliance with the enemy. If your brother, the successor to Jizhou, has acted unfraternally, your duty was to bend your inclination to follow him and wait till the state of affairs had settled. Would it not have been very noble to bring about the redress of wrongs?"""
又與袁尚書曰：,"And to Yuan Shang, Liu Biao wrote:"
「青州天性峭急，迷於曲直。君當先除曹操，以卒先公之恨。事定之後，乃計曲直，不亦善乎？若迷而不返，則是韓盧東郭自困於前，而遺田父之獲也。」,"""Your brother, the ruler of Qingzhou, is of an impulsive temperament and confuses right with wrong. You ought first to have destroyed Cao Cao in order to put an end to the hatred which your father bore him and, when the situation had become settled, to have endeavored to redress the wrongs. Would not that have been well? If you persist in following this mistaken course, remember the hound and the hare, both so wearied that the peasant got them all."""
譚得表書，知表無發兵之意；又自料不能敵操；遂棄平原，走保南皮。曹操追至南皮，時天氣寒肅，河道盡凍，糧船不能行動。操令本處百姓敲冰拽船，百姓聞令而逃。操大怒，欲捕斬之。百姓聞得，乃親往營中投首。操曰：「若不殺汝等，則吾號令不行；若殺汝等，吾又不忍；汝等快往山中藏避，休被我軍士擒獲。」,"From this letter Yuan Tan saw that Liu Biao had no intention of helping him, and feeling he alone could not withstand Cao Cao. He abandoned Pingyuan and fled to Nanpi, whither Cao Cao pursued him.The weather was very cold and the river was frozen, so that the grain boats could not move. Wherefore Cao Cao ordered the inhabitants to break the ice and tow the boats. When the peasants heard the order they ran away. Cao Cao angrily wished to arrest and behead them. When they heard this, they went to his camp in a body and offered their heads to the sword.""If I do not kill you, my order will not be obeyed,"" said Cao Cao. ""Yet supposing I cut off your heads, but I cannot bear to do that severity. Quickly flee to the hills and hide so that my soldiers do not capture you."""
百姓皆垂淚而去。袁譚引兵出城，與曹軍相敵。兩陣對圓，操出馬以鞭指譚而罵曰：「吾厚待汝，汝何生異心？」譚曰：「汝犯吾境界，奪吾城池，賴吾妻子，反說我有異心耶？」操大怒，使徐晃出馬。譚使彭安接戰。兩馬相交，不數合，晃斬彭安於馬下。譚軍敗走，退入南皮。操遣軍四面圍住。譚著慌，使辛評見操約降。操曰：「袁譚小子，反覆無常，吾難准信。汝弟辛毗，吾已重用，汝亦留此可也。」評曰：「丞相差矣。某聞主貴臣榮，主憂臣辱。某久事袁氏，豈可背之？」,"The peasants left weeping. Then Yuan Tan led out his army against Cao Cao. When both sides were arrayed, Cao Cao rode to the front.Pointing with his whip at his opponent, Cao Cao railed at him, saying, ""I treated you well. Why then have you turned against me?""Yuan Tan replied, ""You have invaded my land, captured my cities, and broken off my marriage. Yet you accuse me of turning against you!""Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang to go out and give battle. Yuan Tan bade Peng An accept the challenge. After a few bouts Peng An was slain; and Yuan Tan, having lost, fled and went into Nanpi, where he was besieged. Yuan Tan, panic-stricken, sent Xin Ping to see Cao Cao and arrange surrender.""He is nothing but a fickle-minded child,"" said Cao Cao. ""He is never of the same mind two days running, and I cannot depend upon what he says. Now your brother Xin Pi is in my employ and has a post of importance, you had better remain here also.""""Sir Prime Minister, you are in error,"" said Xin Ping. ""It is said that the lord's honor is the servant's glory; the lord's sadness is the servant's shame. How can I turn my back on the family I have so long served?"""
操知其不可留，乃遣回。評回見譚，言操不准投降。譚叱曰：「汝弟見事曹操，汝懷二心耶？」評聞言，氣滿填胸，昏絕於地。譚令扶出，須臾而死。譚亦悔之。郭圖謂譚曰：「來日盡驅百姓當先，以軍繼其後，與曹操決一死戰。」,"Cao Cao felt he could not be persuaded and sent him back. Xin Ping returned and told Yuan Tan the surrender could not be arranged.Yuan Tan turned on him angrily, saying, ""Your brother is with Cao Cao, and you want to betray me also!""At this unmerited reproach such a huge wave of anger welled up in Xin Ping's breast that he was overcome and fell in a swoon. They carried him out, but the shock had been too severe, and soon after he died. Yuan Tan regretted his conduct when it was too late.Then Guo Tu said, ""Tomorrow when we go out to battle, we will drive the people out in front as a screen for the soldiers, and we must fight a winning battle."""
譚從其言。當夜盡驅南皮百姓，皆執刀槍聽令。次日平明，大開四門，軍在後驅，百姓在前，喊聲大舉，一齊擁出，直抵曹寨。兩軍混戰，自辰至午，勝負未分，殺人遍地。操見未獲全勝，乘馬上山，親自擊鼓。將士見之，奮力向前。譚軍大敗，百姓被殺者無數。曹洪奮威突陣，正迎袁譚，舉刀亂砍，譚竟被曹洪殺於陣中。郭圖見陣大亂，急馳入城中。樂進望見，拈弓搭箭，射下城壕，人馬俱陷。,"That night they assembled all the common people of the place and forced into their hands swords and spears. At daylight they opened the four gates, and a huge party with much shouting came out at each, peasantry carrying arms in front, and soldiers behind them. They pushed on toward Cao Cao's camps, and a melee began lasted till near midday. But this was quite indecisive, although heaps of dead lay everywhere.Seeing that success was at best only partial, Cao Cao rode out to the hills near and thence had the drums beaten for a new attack under his own eye. His officers and troops, seeing that he could observe them in person, exerted themselves to the utmost, and Yuan Tan's army was severely defeated. Of the peasantry driven into the battlefield, multitudes were slain.Cao Hong, who displayed very great valor, burst into the press of battle and met Yuan Tan face to face. The two slashed and hammered at each other, and Yuan Tan was killed. Guo Tu saw that his side was wholly disorganized and tried to withdraw into the shelter of Nanpi. Yue Jing saw this and opened a tremendous discharge of arrows so that Guo Tu fell and the moat was soon filled with dead."
操引兵入南皮，安撫百姓。忽有一彪軍來到，乃袁熙部將焦觸、張南也。操自引軍迎之。二將倒戈卸甲，特來投降。操封為列侯。又黑山賊張燕，引軍十萬來降，操封為平北將軍。下令將袁譚首級號令，敢有哭者斬。頭挂北門外。一人布冠衰衣，哭於頭下。左右拏來見操。操問之，乃青州別駕王修也，因諫袁譚被逐，今知譚死，故來哭之。,"The city of Nanpi fell to Cao Cao. He entered and set about restoring peace and order. Then suddenly appeared a new army under two of Yuan Xi's generals, Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng. Cao Cao led out his troops to meet them, but the two commanders laid down their arms and yielded. They were rewarded with the rank of lordship.Then Zhang Yan, the leader of the Black Hills Brigands, came with one hundred thousand troops and gave in his submission. He was made General Who Pacifies the North.By an order of Cao Cao, the head of Yuan Tan was exposed, and death was threatened to anyone who should lament for him. Nevertheless a man dressed in mourning attire was arrested for weeping below the exposed head at the north gate. Taken into Cao Cao's presence, he said he was Wang Xiu and had been an officer in Qingzhou. He had been expelled because he had remonstrated with Yuan Tan. But when the news of Yuan Tan's death came, he had come to weep for his late master."
操曰：「汝知吾令否？」修曰：「知之。」操曰：「汝不怕死耶？」修曰：「我生受其祿，令亡而不哭，非義也。畏死忘義，何以立世乎！若得收葬譚屍，受戮無恨。」操曰：「河北義士，何其如此之多也！可惜袁氏不能用！若能用，則吾安敢正眼覷此地哉？」遂命收葬譚屍，禮修為上賓，以為司金中郎將；因問之曰：「今袁尚已投袁熙，取之當用何策？」修不答。操曰：「忠臣也。」問郭嘉，嘉曰：「可使袁氏降將焦觸、張南等自攻之。」操用其言，隨差焦觸、張南、呂曠、呂翔、馬延、張顗，各引本部兵，分三路進攻幽州；一面使李典、樂進會合張燕，打并州，攻高幹。,"""Did you know of my command?"" said Cao Cao.""I knew it.""""Yet you were not afraid?""""When one has received favors from a man in life, it would be wrong not to mourn at his death. How can one stand in the world if one forgets duty through fear? If I could bury his body, I would not mind death.""Cao Cao said, ""And there were many such as this in the north. What a pity that the Yuan family could not make the best of them! But if they had done so, I should never have dared to turn my eyes toward this place.""The intrepid mourner was not put to death. The remains of Yuan Tan were properly interred, and Wang Xiu was well treated and even given an appointment.In his new position Wang Xiu was asked for advice about the best way to proceed against Yuan Shang, who had fled to his second brother, but Wang Xiu remained silent, thereby winning from Cao Cao renewed admiration for his constancy.""He is indeed loyal!"" said Cao Cao.Then he questioned Guo Jia, who advised him, saying, ""Give Yuan Xi's former generals the command and ask them to attack Youzhou.""Whereupon Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng were given the command and reinforced by the armies under Lu Xiang, Lu Kuang, Ma Yan, and Zhang Zi to bring about the surrender of Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang. Then six generals, to attack Youzhou along three routes. Other armies led by Li Dian, Yue Jing, and Zhang Yan were sent against Gao Gan at Bingzhou."
且說袁尚、袁熙知曹兵將至，料難迎敵，乃棄城引兵，星夜奔遼西，投烏桓去了。幽州刺史烏桓觸，聚幽州眾官，歃血為盟，共議背袁向曹之事。烏桓觸先言曰：「吾知曹丞相當世英雄，今往投降，有不遵令者斬。」依次歃血，循至別駕韓珩。珩乃擲劍於地，大呼曰：「吾受袁公父子厚恩，今主敗亡，智不能救，勇不能死！於義缺矣！若北面而降曹，吾不為也！」,"The two Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang heard of Cao Cao's advance with dismay for they had no hope of successful resistance. Therefore they abandoned Youzhou and hastily marched into Liaoxi to seek refuge with the Wuhuan tribespeople in the frontier Wuhuan State.Then Wuhuan Chu, new Imperial Protector of Youzhou, was not disposed to incur the enmity of the powerful Cao Cao, so he called his subordinates together to swear them to support him.Wuhuan Chu said, ""I understand that Cao Cao is the most powerful man of the day, and I am going to support him, and those who do not go with me I shall put to death.""Each in turn smeared his lips with the blood of sacrifice and took the oath, till it came to the turn of Han Heng.Instead he dashed his sword to the ground, crying, ""I have received great promotions and benefits from the Yuans. Now my lord has been vanquished. My knowledge was powerless to save him, and my bravery insufficient to cause me to die for him: I have failed in my duty. But I refuse to commit the crowning act of treachery and ally myself with Cao Cao."""
眾皆失色。烏桓觸曰：「夫興大事，當立大義。事之濟否，不待一人。韓珩既有志如此，聽其自便。」推珩而出。烏桓觸乃出城迎接三路軍馬，逕來降操。操大喜，加為鎮北將軍。忽探馬來報：「樂進、李典、張燕攻打并州，高幹守住壺口關，不能下。」操自勒兵前往。三將接著，說：「幹拒關難擊。」操集眾將共議破幹之計。荀攸曰：「若破幹，須用詐降計方可。」,"This speech made the others turn pale.The chief said, ""For a great undertaking, there must be lofty principles. However, success does not necessarily depend upon universal support, and since Han Heng is actuated by such sentiments, then let him follow his conscience.""So Wuhuan Chu turned Han Heng out of the assembly. Wuhuan Chu then went out of the city to meet and welcome Cao Cao's army and rendered his submission. He was well received and the title given him of General Who Guards the North.Then the scouts came to report: ""Generals Li Dian, Yue Jing, and Zhang Yan had marched to Bingzhou, but that Gao Gan had occupied Huguan Pass and could not be dislodged.""So Cao Cao marched thither himself. The defender still maintaining his position, Cao Cao asked for plans. Xun You proposed that a band should go over pretending to be deserters."
操然之。喚降將呂曠、呂翔，附耳低言，如此如此。呂曠等引軍數十，直抵關下，叫曰：「吾等原係袁氏舊將，不得已而降曹。曹操為人詭譎，薄待吾等，吾今還扶舊主。可疾開門相納。」高幹未信，只教二將自上關說話。二將卸甲棄馬而入，謂幹曰：「曹軍新到，可乘其軍心未定，今夜劫寨。某等願當先。」,"Cao Cao assented and then called the two Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang, to whom he gave whispered orders. They left with their companies.Soon they came near the pass and called out, saying, ""We are old officers in Yuan Shao's armies forced into surrender to Cao Cao. We find him so false and he treats us so meanly that we want to return to help our old master. Wherefore quickly open your gates to us.""Gao Gan was suspicious, but he let the two officers come up to the pass; and when they had stripped off their armor and left their horses, they were permitted to enter.And they said to Gao Gan, ""Cao Cao's troops are new to the country and not settled. You ought to fall upon their camp this very evening. If you approve, we will lead the attack."""
幹喜從其言，是夜教二呂當先，引萬餘軍前去。將至曹寨，背後喊聲大震，伏兵四起。高幹知是中計，急回壺關城。樂進、李典已奪了關。高幹奪路走脫，往投單于。操領兵拒住關口，使人追襲高幹。幹到單于界，正迎北番左賢王。幹下馬拜伏於地，言：「曹操吞併疆土，今欲犯王子地面，萬乞救援，同力克復，以保北方。」左賢王曰：「吾與曹操無讎，豈有侵我土地？汝欲使我結怨於曹氏耶！」叱退高幹。幹尋思無路，只得去投劉表。行至上潞，被都尉王琰所殺，將頭解送曹操。操封琰為列侯。,"Gao Gan decided to trust them and prepared to attack, giving the two brothers the leadership of ten thousand soldiers. But as they drew near Cao Cao's camp, a great noise arose behind them and they found themselves in an ambush attacked on all sides. Realizing too late that he had been the victim of a ruse, Gao Gan retreated to the pass, but found it occupied by Li Dian and Yue Jing. Gao Gan then made the best of his way to the Chieftain of the Xiongnu People. Cao Cao gave orders to hold the passes and sent companies in pursuit.When Gao Gan reached the boundary of the Xiongnu State, he met Ce Xian, the Khan of the northern tribespeople.Gao Gan dismounted and made a low obeisance, saying, ""Cao Cao is conquering and absorbing all the borders and your turn, O King, will come quickly. I pray you help me and let us smite together for the safety of the northern regions.""Ce Xian the Khan replied, ""I have no quarrel with Cao Cao. Why then should he invade my land? Do you desire to embroil me with him?""He would have nothing to do with Gao Gan and sent him sway. At his wits' end, Gao Gan decided to try to join Liu Biao and go southward so far on his journey as Shanglu when he was taken prisoner and put to death by Governor Wang Yan. His head was sent to Cao Cao, and Wang Yan received lordship for this service."
并州既定，操商議西擊烏桓。曹洪等曰：「袁熙、袁尚兵敗將亡，勢窮力盡。遠投沙漠。我今引兵西擊，倘劉備、劉表乘虛襲許都，我救應不及，為禍不淺矣。請回師勿進為上。」郭嘉曰：「諸公所言差矣：主公雖威震天下，沙漠之人，恃其邊遠，必不設備；乘其無備，卒然擊之，必可破也。且袁紹與烏桓有恩，而尚與熙兄弟猶存，不可不除。劉表坐談之客耳，自知才不足以御劉備，重任之，則恐不能制；輕任之，則備不為用。雖虛國遠征，公無憂也。」操曰：「奉孝之言極是。」,"Thus Bingzhou was conquered. Then Cao Cao began to discuss the overthrow of the Wuhuan State.Cao Hong, speaking in the name of other officials, said, ""The two Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang are nearly done for and too weak to be feared. They have fled far into the Sea of Sand. If we pursue them thither, it may bring down Liu Biao and Liu Bei upon the capital. Should we be unable to rescue it, the misfortune would be immense. Wherefore we beg you to return to Xuchang.""But Guo Jia was of different advice.""You are wrong,"" said he. ""Though the prestige of our lord fills the empire, yet the peoples of the desert, relying upon their inaccessibility, will not be prepared against us. Wherefore I say attack, and we shall conquer them. Beside Yuan Shao was kind to the nomads, and the two brothers have been more so. They must be destroyed. As for Liu Biao he is a mere gossip, who needs not cause the least anxiety. And Liu Bei is unfit for any heavy responsibility and will take no trouble over a light one. You may leave the base with perfect safety and make as long an expedition as you choose. Nothing will happen.""""You speak well, O Guo Jia,"" said Cao Cao."
遂率大小三軍，車數千輛，望前進發。但見黃沙漠漠，狂風四起；道路崎嶇，人馬難行。操有回軍之心，問於郭嘉。嘉此時不服水土，臥病車中。操泣曰：「因我欲平沙漠，使公遠涉艱辛，以至染病，吾心何安？」嘉曰：「某感丞相大恩，雖死不能報萬一。」操曰：「吾見北地崎嶇，意欲回軍，若何？」嘉曰：「兵貴神速。今千里襲人，輜重多而難以趨利，不如輕兵兼道以出，掩其不備。但須得識徑路者為引導耳。」,"He led his legions, heavy and light, to the edge of the desert, with many wagons. The expedition marched into the Gobi Desert. The rolling ocean of yellow sand spread its waves before them, and they saw far and near the eddying sand pillars, and felt the fierce winds that drove them forward. The road became precipitous and progress difficult. Cao Cao began to think of returning and spoke thereof to Guo Jia, who had advised the journey.Guo Jia had speedily fallen victim to the effects of the climate, and at this time he lay in his cart very ill.Cao Cao's tears fell as he said, ""My friend, you are suffering for my ambition to subdue the Gobi Desert. I cannot bear to think you should be ill.""""You have always been very good to me,"" said the sick man, ""and I can never repay what I owe you.""""The country is exceedingly precipitous, and I am thinking of going back. What think you?""Guo Jia replied, ""The success of an expedition of this kind depends upon celerity. To strike a sudden blow on a distant spot with a heavy baggage train is difficult. To ensure success the need is light troops and a good road to strike quickly before an enemy has time to prepare. Now you must find guides who know the road well."""
遂留郭嘉於易州養病，求鄉導官以引路。人薦袁紹舊將田疇深知此境，操召而問之。疇曰：「此道夏秋間有水，淺不通車馬，深不載舟楫，最難行動；不如回軍，從盧龍口越白檀之險，出空虛之地，前近柳城，掩其不備，冒頓可一戰而擒也。」,"Then the sick adviser was left at Yezhou for treatment, and they sought among the natives for some persons to serve as guides. Tian Chou, one of Yuan Shao's old generals, knew those parts well, and Cao Cao called him and questioned him.Tian Chou said, ""Between autumn and summer this route is under water, the shallow places too heavy for wheeled traffic, the deep parts insufficient for boats. It is always difficult. Therefore you would do better to return and at Lulong cross the Baitan Pass into the desert. Then advance to Liucheng and smite before there is time to prepare. One sudden rush will settle King Mao Dun."""
操從其言，封田疇為靖北將軍，作鄉導官，為前驅。張遼為次。操自押後，倍道輕騎而進。田疇引張遼前至白狼山，正遇袁熙，袁尚會合冒頓等數萬騎前來。張遼飛報曹操。操自勒馬登高望之，見冒頓兵無隊伍，參差不整。操謂張遼曰：「敵兵不整，便可擊之。」乃以麾授遼。遼引許褚、于禁、徐晃分四路下山，奮力急攻。冒頓大亂。遼拍馬斬冒頓於馬下，餘眾皆降。袁熙、袁尚引數千騎投遼東去了。,"For this valuable information and plan, Tian Chou was made General Who Calms the North, and went in advance as leader and guide. Next after him came Zhang Liao, and Cao Cao brought up the rear. They advanced by double marches.Tian Chou led Zhang Liao to White Wolf Hills, where they came upon Yuan Xi, Yuan Shang, and King Mao Dun and a force of ten thousand cavalry. Zhang Liao galloped to inform his chief, and Cao Cao rode up to the top of an eminence to survey the foe. He saw a large mass of cavalry without any military formation advancing in a disorderly crowd.Said he, ""They have no formation. We can easily rout them.""Then he handed over his ensign of command to Zhang Liao who, with Xu Chu, Yu Jin, and Xu Huang, made a vigorous attack from four different points, with the result that the enemy was thrown into confusion. Zhang Liao rode forward and slew King Mao Dun, and the other generals gave in. Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang with a few thousand of horse got away east into Liaodong."
操收軍入柳城，封田疇為柳亭侯，以守柳城。疇涕泣曰：「某負義逃竄之人耳，蒙厚恩全活，為幸多矣；豈可賣盧龍之寨，以邀賞祿哉！死不敢受侯爵。」操義之，乃拜疇為議郎。操撫慰單于人等，收得駿馬萬匹，即日回兵。時天氣寒且旱，二百里無水，軍又乏糧，殺馬為食；鑿地三四丈，方得水。操回至易州，重賞先曾諫者；因謂眾將曰：「孤前者乘危遠征，僥倖成功。雖得勝，天所佑也，不可以為法。諸君之諫，乃萬安之計，是以相賞。後勿難言。」,"Cao Cao then led his army into Liucheng. For his services, Tian Chou was conferred the rank of Lord of Liucheng and Commander of that county.But Tian Chou declined the rank, saying with tears, ""I am a renegade and a fugitive. It is my good fortune that you spared my life, and how can I accept a rank for betraying Lulong? I would rather die than accept the lordship.""Cao Cao recognized that reason was on Tian Chou's side and conferred upon him the office of Court Counselor. Cao Cao then pacified the Xiongnu Chieftains, collected a large number of horses, and at once set out on the homeward march.The season was winter, cold and dry. For seventy miles there was no water, and grain also was scanty. The troops fed on horse flesh. They had to dig very deep, three or four hundred spans to find water.When Cao Cao reached Yezhou, he rewarded those who had remonstrated with him against the expedition.He said, ""I took some risk in going so far, but by good fortune I have succeeded. With the aid of Heaven I have secured victory. I could not be guided by your advice, but still they were counsels of safety, and therefore I reward you to prove my appreciation of advice and that hereafter you may not fear to speak your minds."""
操到易州時，郭嘉已死數日，停柩在公廨。操往祭之，大哭曰：「奉孝死，乃天喪吾也！」回顧眾官曰：「諸君年齒，皆孤等輩，惟奉孝最少。吾欲託以後事，不期中年夭折，使吾心腸崩裂矣！」嘉之左右，將嘉臨死封之書呈上曰：「郭公臨死，親筆書此，囑曰：『丞相若從書中所言，遼東事定矣。』」操拆書視之，點頭嗟歎。諸人皆不知其意。,"Adviser Guo Jia did not live to see the return of his lord. His coffin was placed on the bier in a hall of the government offices, and Cao Cao went thither to sacrifice to his manes.Cao Cao mourned for him, crying, ""Alas! Heaven has smitten me: Guo Jia is dead!""Then turning to his officers he said, ""You, gentlemen, are of the same age as myself, but he was very young to die. I needed him for the future generation, and unhappily he has been torn from me in the flower of his age. My heart and my bowels are torn with grief."" The servants of the late adviser presented his last testament, which they said his dying hand had written, and he had told them to say, ""If the Prime Minister shall follow the advice given herein, then Liaodong will be secure.""Cao Cao opened the cover and read, nodding his head in agreement and uttering deep sighs. But no other person knew what was written therein."
次日，夏侯惇引眾入稟曰：「遼東太守公孫康，久不賓服。今袁熙、袁尚又往投之，必為後患。不如乘其未動，速往征之，遼東可得也。」操笑曰：「不煩諸公虎威，數日之後，公孫康自送二袁之首至矣。」諸將皆不肯信。,"Shortly after, Xiahou Dun at the head of a delegation presented a petition, saying, ""For a long time the Governor of Liaodong, Gongsun Kang, has been contumacious, and it bodes ill for peace that the Yuan brothers have fled to him. Would it not be well to attack before they move against you?""""I need not trouble your tiger courage, Sirs,"" said Cao Cao smiling. ""Wait a few days and you will see the heads of our two enemies sent to me.""They could not believe it."
卻說袁熙、袁尚引數千騎奔遼東。遼東太守公孫康，本襄平人，武威將軍公孫度之子也。當日知袁熙、袁尚來投，遂聚本部屬官商議此事。公孫恭曰：「袁紹存日，常有吞遼東之心；今袁熙、袁尚兵敗將亡，無處依棲，來此相投，是鳩奪鵲巢之意也。若容納之，後必相圖。不如賺入城中殺之，獻頭與曹公，曹公必重待我。」康曰：「只怕曹操引兵下遼東，又不如納二袁使為我助。」恭曰：「可使人探聽。如曹兵來攻，則留二袁；如其不動，則殺二袁，送與曹公。」康從之，使人去探消息。,"As has been related the two Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang escaped to the east with a few hundreds of horse. The Governor of Liaodong was a son of Gongsun Du the Warlike, the General of Han. Gongsun Kang was a native of Xiangping. When he heard that Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang were on their way to his territory, he called a council to decide upon his plan.At the council Gongsun Gong rose, saying, ""When Yuan Shao was alive, he nourished the plan of adding this territory to his own. Now his sons, homeless, with a broken army and no officers, are coming here. It seems to me like the dove stealing the magpie's nest. If we offer them shelter, they will assuredly intrigue against us. I advise that they be inveigled into the city, put to death, and their heads sent to Cao Cao, who will be most grateful to us.""Said the Governor Gongsun Kang, ""I have one fear: Cao Cao will come against us. If so, it would be better to have the help of the Yuans against him.""""Then you can send spies to ascertain whether Cao Cao's army is preparing to attack us. If it is, then save the Yuans alive; if not, then follow my advice.""It was decided to wait till the spies came back."
卻說袁熙、袁尚至遼東，二人密議曰：「遼東軍兵數萬，足可與曹操爭衡。今暫投之，後當殺公孫康而奪其地，養成氣力而抗中原，可復河北也。」,"In the meantime, Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang had taken counsel together as they approached Liaodong, saying, ""Liaodong has a large army, strong enough to oppose Cao Cao. We will go thither and submit till we can slay the Governor and take possession. Then when we are strong enough, we will attack and recover our own land."""
商議已定，乃入見公孫康，康留於館驛，只推有病，不即相見。不一日，細作回報：「曹操兵屯易州，並無下遼東之意。」公孫康大喜，乃先伏刀斧手於壁衣中，使二袁入。相見禮畢，命坐。時天氣嚴寒，尚見床榻上無裀褥，謂康曰：「願鋪坐席。」康瞋目言曰：「汝二人之頭，將行萬里！何席之有？」尚大驚。康叱曰：「左右何不下手！」刀斧手擁出，就坐席上砍下二人之頭，用木匣盛貯，使人送到易州，來見曹操。,"With these intentions they went into the city. They were received and lodged in the guests' quarters. But when they wished to see Gongsun Kang, he put them off with the excuse of indisposition.However, before many days the spies returned with the news that Cao Cao's army was quiescent and there was no hint of any attack.Then Gongsun Kang called Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang into his presence. But before they came he hid swordsmen and ax-men behind the arras in the hall. When the visitors came and had made their salutations, Gongsun Kang bade them be seated.Now it was bitterly cold and on the couches where they were sitting were no coverings. So Yuan Shang said, ""May we have cushions?""The host said, ""When your heads take that long, long journey, will there be any cushions?""Before Yuan Shang could recover from his fright, Gongsun Kang shouted, ""Why do you not begin?""At this out rushed the assassins and the heads of the two brothers were cut off as they sat. Packed in a small wooden box they were sent to Cao Cao at Yezhou."
時操在易州，按兵不動。夏侯惇、張遼入稟曰：「如不下遼東，可回許都；恐劉表生心。」操曰：「待二袁首級至，即便回兵。」眾皆暗笑。忽報遼東公孫康遣人送袁熙、袁尚首級至，眾皆大驚。使者呈上書信。操大笑曰：「果不出奉孝之料！」重賞來使，封公孫康為襄平侯左將軍。眾官問曰；「何為不出奉孝之所料？」操遂出郭嘉書以示之。書略曰：,"All this time Cao Cao had been calmly waiting. His impatient officers had petitioned in a body, saying, ""Let's march to the capital to ward off Liu Biao's threat if we are not going to attack the east.""Cao Cao said, ""I am waiting for the heads of the enemy. We will go as soon as the heads arrive.""In their secret hearts they laughed. But then, surely enough, messenger soon came from Liaodong bringing the heads. Then they were greatly surprised.And when the messenger presented Gongsun Kang's letters, Cao Cao cried, ""Just as Guo Jia said!""He amply rewarded the messenger, and the Governor of Liaodong was made Lord of Xiangping and General of the Left Army. When the officers asked what had happened, Cao Cao told them what the late adviser had predicted. He read to them the dead officer's testament, which ran something like this:"
今聞袁熙、袁尚往投遼東，明公切不可加兵。公孫康久畏袁氏吞併，二袁往投必疑。若以兵擊之，必併力迎敵，急不可下；若緩之，公孫康、袁氏必自相圖，其勢然也。,"""Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang are going to Liaodong. Illustrious Sir, you are on no account to attack, for Gongsun Kang has long lived in fear lest the Yuans should absorb his country. When they arrive, Gongsun Kang will hesitate. If you attack, he will save the Yuans to help him; if you wait, they will work against each other. This is evident."""
眾皆踴躍稱善。操引眾官復設祭於郭嘉靈前，亡年三十八歲。從征十有一年，多立奇勳。後人有詩讚曰：,"The officers simply jumped with surprise to see how perfectly events had been foreseen. Then Cao Cao at the head of all his officers performed a grand sacrifice before the coffin of the wise Guo Jia. He had died at the age of thirty-eight, after eleven years of meritorious and wonderful service in wars."
天生郭奉孝，豪傑冠群英。腹內藏經史，胸中隱甲兵。,"When Heaven permitted Guo Jia's birth,It made him ablest man on earth.He knew by rote all histories,From him war kept no mysteries."
運謀如范蠡，決策似陳平。可惜身先喪，中原梁棟傾。,"Like Fan Li's, his plans were quite decisive,As Chen Ping's, his strokes were most incisive.Too soon he ran his earthly race,Too soon the great beam fell from place."
操領兵還冀州，使人先扶郭嘉靈柩於許都安葬。程昱等請曰：「北方既定，今還許都，可早建下江南之策。」操笑曰：「吾有此志久矣。諸君所言，止合吾意。」是夜宿於冀州城東角樓上，憑欄仰觀天文。時荀攸在側。操指曰：「南方旺氣燦然，恐未可圖也。」攸曰：「以丞相天威，何所不服？」,"When Cao Cao returned to Jizhou, he sent off the coffin of his late adviser to Capital Xuchang where it was interred.Then Cheng Yu and others said, ""As the north has been overcome, it is time to settle the south.""Cao Cao was pleased and said, ""That has long occupied my thoughts.""The last night he spent in Jizhou, Cao Cao went to the eastern corner tower and stood there regarding the sky. His only companion was Xun You.Presently Cao Cao said, ""That is a very brilliant glow there in the south. It seems too strong for me to do anything there.""""What is there that can oppose your heaven-high prestige?"" said Xun You."
正看間，忽見一道金光，從地而起。攸曰：「此必有寶於地下。」操下樓令人隨光掘之。正是：星文方向南中指，金寶旋從北地生。不知所得何物，且看下文分解。,"Suddenly a beam of golden light shot up out of the earth.""Surely a treasure is buried there,"" remarked Xun You.They went down from the city wall, called some guards, and led them to the point whence the light proceeded. There the men were ordered to dig.The southern skies with portents glow,The northern lands their treasures show.What the diggers found will appear in the next chapter."
