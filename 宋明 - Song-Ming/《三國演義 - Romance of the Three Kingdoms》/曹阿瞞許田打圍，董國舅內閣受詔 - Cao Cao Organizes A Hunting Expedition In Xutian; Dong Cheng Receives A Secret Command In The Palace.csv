話說曹操舉劍欲殺張遼，玄德攀住臂膊，雲長跪於面前。玄德曰：「此等赤心之人，正當留用。」雲長曰：「關某素知文遠忠義之士，願以性命保之。」操擲劍笑曰：「我亦知文遠忠義，故戲之耳。」乃親釋其縛，解衣衣之，延之上坐。遼感其意，遂降。操拜遼為中郎將，賜爵關內侯，使招安臧霸。,"The last chapter said that Cao Cao was checked in his angry attack upon Zhang Liao. They were Liu Bei who held his arm and Guan Yu who knelt before him.""A man as generous-hearted as he is should be saved,"" said Liu Bei.Guan Yu said, ""I know him well as loyal and righteous. I will vouch for him with my own life!""Cao Cao threw aside his sword and smiled.""I also know Zhang Liao to be loyal and good. I was just testing him,"" said he.Cao Cao loosed the prisoner's bonds with his own hands, had a change of dress brought in, and clothed him therewith. Then he was led to a seat of honor. This kindly treatment sank deep into Zhang Liao's heart, and he hastened to declare formally that he yielded. And then he was given the rank of Imperial Commander and the title of Lordship."
聞呂布已死，張遼已降，遂亦引本部軍投降。操厚賞之。臧霸又招安孫觀，吳敦，尹禮，來降；獨昌豨未肯歸順。操封臧霸為瑯琊相。孫觀等亦各加官，令守青、徐沿海地面。將呂布妻女載回許都。大犒三軍，拔寨班師。路過徐州，百姓焚香遮道，請留劉使君為牧。操曰：「劉使君功大，且待面君封爵，回來未遲。」百姓叩謝。操喚車騎將軍車冑權領徐州。操軍回許昌，封賞出征人員，留玄德在相府左近宅院歇定。,"Zhang Liao was sent on a mission to win over the bandit leader Zang Ba, who hearing what had happened, came forthwith and gave in his submission. He was graciously received, and his former colleagues —-Sun Guan, Wu Dun, and Yin Li —-also yielded, with the exception of Chang Xi, who remained obdurate. All these former enemies who came over were kindly treated and given posts of responsibility wherein they might prove the reality of their conversion. Lu Bu's family were sent to the capital.After the soldiers had been rewarded with feasting, the camp was broken up and the army moved away to Xuchang. Passing through Xuzhou the people lined the roads and burned incense in honor of the victors. They also petitioned that Liu Bei should be their protector.Cao Cao replied, ""Liu Bei has rendered great services. You must wait till he has been received in audience and obtained his reward. After that he shall be sent here.""The people bowed low to the ground to express their thanks. Che Zhou, General of the Flying Cavalry, was given command of Xuzhou for the moment.After the army had arrived at the capital, rewards were granted to all the officers who had been in the expedition. Liu Bei was retained in the capital, lodging in an annex to the Prime Minister's palace."
次日，獻帝設朝，操表奏玄德軍功，引玄德見帝。玄德具朝服拜於丹墀。帝宣上殿問曰：「卿祖何人？」玄德奏曰：「臣乃中山靖王之後，孝景皇帝閣下玄孫，劉雄之孫，劉弘之子也。」帝教取宗族世譜檢看，令宗正卿宣讀曰：,"Next day a court was held, and Cao Cao memorialized the services of Liu Bei who was presented to Emperor Xian. Dressed in court robes, Liu Bei bowed at the lower end of the audience arena. The Emperor called him to the Hall and asked his ancestry.Liu Bei replied, ""Thy servant is the son of Liu Hong, grandson of Liu Xiong, who was a direct descendant of Prince Sheng of Zhongshan, who was the son of His Majesty the Emperor Jing (reigned BC 157-141).""The Emperor bade them bring forth the Books of the Genealogies, and therefrom a secretary read:"
孝景皇帝生十四子。第七子乃中山靖王劉勝。勝生陸城亭侯劉貞。貞生沛侯劉昂。昂生漳侯劉祿。祿生沂水侯劉戀。戀生欽陽侯劉英。英生安國侯劉建。建生廣陵侯劉哀。哀生膠水侯劉憲。憲生祖邑侯劉舒。舒生祁陽侯劉誼。誼生原澤侯劉必。必生潁川侯劉達。達生豐靈侯劉不疑。不疑生濟川侯劉惠。惠生東郡范令劉雄。雄生劉弘。弘不仕劉備乃劉弘之子也。,"""Liu Jing the Filial Emperor begot fourteen sons of whom the seventh was Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan. Sheng begot Liu Zhen, Lord of Luchang. Zhen begot Liu Ang, Lord of Pei. Ang begot Liu Lu, Lord of Zhang. Lu begot Liu Lian, Lord of Yishui. Lian begot Liu Ying, Lord of Qinyang. Ying begot Liu Jian, Lord of Anguo. Jian begot Liu Ai, Lord of Guangling. Ai begot Liu Xia, Lord of Jiaoshui. Xia begot Liu Shu, Lord of Zuyi. Shu begot Liu Yi, Lord of Qiyang. Yi begot Liu Bi, Lord of Yuanze. Bi begot Liu Da, Lord of Yingchuan. Da begot Liu Buyi, Lord of Fengling. Buyi begot Liu Hui, Lord of Jichuan. Hui begot Liu Xiong, Governor of Zhuo. Xiong begot Liu Hong, who held no office or rank; and Liu Bei is his son."""
帝排世譜，則玄德乃帝之叔也。帝大喜，請入偏殿敘叔姪之禮。帝暗思：「曹操弄權，國事都不由朕主，今得此英雄之叔，朕有助矣！」遂拜玄德為左將軍宜城亭侯。設宴款待畢，玄德謝恩出朝。自此人皆稱為劉皇叔。,"The Emperor compared this with the registers of the Imperial House and found by them that Liu Bei was his uncle by descent. The Emperor seemed greatly pleased and requested Liu Bei to go into one of the side chambers where he might perform the ceremonial obeisance prescribed for a nephew to his uncle. In his heart he rejoiced to have this heroic warrior uncle as a powerful supporter against Cao Cao who really held all the power in his own hands. The Emperor knew himself to be a mere puppet. He conferred upon his uncle the rank of General of the Left Army and the title of Lord of Yicheng.When the banquet was concluded, Liu Bei thanked the Emperor and went out of the Palace. And from this time he was very generally styled the ""Imperial Uncle."""
曹操回府，荀彧等一班謀士入見曰：「天子認劉備為叔，恐無益於明公。」操曰：「彼既認為皇叔，吾以天子之詔令之，彼愈不敢不服矣。況吾留彼在許都，名雖近君，實在吾掌握之內，吾何懼哉？吾所慮者，太尉楊彪係袁術親戚；倘與二袁為內應，為害不淺。當即除之。」乃密使人誣告彪交通袁術，遂收彪下獄，命滿寵按治之。,"When Cao Cao returned to his palace, Xun Yu and his fellow advisers went in to see him.Xun Yu said, ""It is no advantage to you, Illustrious Sir, that the Emperor recognizes Liu Bei as an uncle.""""Liu Bei may be recognized as uncle, but he is under my orders since I control the decrees of the Throne. He will be all the more ready to obey. Beside I will keep him here under the pretense of having him near his sovereign, and he will be entirely in my hands. I have nothing to fear. The man I fear is Yang Biao, who is a relative of the two Yuan brothers. Should Yang Biao conspire with them, he is an enemy within and might do much harm. He will have to be removed.""Hence Cao Cao sent a secret emissary to say that Imperial Guardian Yang Biao was intriguing with Yuan Shu, and on this charge Yang Biao was arrested and imprisoned. And his death would have been compassed had his enemy dared."
時北海太守孔融在許都，因諫操曰：「楊公四世清德，豈可因袁氏而罪之乎？」操曰：「此朝延意也。」融曰：「使成王殺召公，周公可得言不知耶？」操不得已，乃免彪官，放歸田里。議郎趙彥憤操專橫，上疏劾操不奉帝旨、擅收大臣之罪。操大怒，即收趙彥殺之。於是百官無不悚懼。謀士程昱說操曰：「今明公威名日盛，何不乘此時行王霸之事？」操曰：「朝廷股肱尚多，未可輕動。吾當請天子田獵，以觀動靜。」,"But just then the Governor of Beihai, Kong Rong, was at the capital, and he remonstrated with Cao Cao, saying, ""Yang Biao comes from a family famed for virtue for at least four generations. You cannot trump up so foolish a charge as that against him.""""It is the wish of His Majesty!"" retorted Cao Cao.""If the child Emperor Cheng of Zhou Dynasty had put Duke Chao to death, could the people have believed Duke Zhou, the Regent Marshal, had nothing to do with it?""So Cao Cao had to relinquish the attempt, but he took away Yang Biao's offices and banished him to his family estate in the country.Court Counselor Zhao Yan, an opponent of the Prime Minister, sent up a memorial impeaching Cao Cao for having removed a minister of state from office without a decree. Cao Cao's reply to this was the arrest of Zhao Yan and his execution, a bold stroke which terrified the bulk of officers and reduced them to silence.Cheng Yu advised Cao Cao to assume a more definite position. He said, ""Illustrious Sir, your prestige grows daily. Why not seize the opportunity to take the position of Chief of the Feudatory Princes?""""There are still too many supporters of the court,"" was the reply. ""I must be careful. I am going to propose a royal hunt to try to find out the best line to follow."""
於是揀選良馬，名鷹俊犬，弓矢俱備，先聚兵城外，操入請天子田獵。帝曰：「田獵恐非正道。」操曰：「古之帝王，春蒐夏苗，秋獮冬狩，四時出郊，以示武於天下。今四海擾攘之時，正當借田獵以講武。」帝不敢不從，隨即上逍遙馬，帶寶雕弓、金鈚箭，排鑾駕出城。玄德與關、張各彎弓插箭，內穿掩心甲，手持兵器，引數十騎隨駕出許昌。曹操騎爪黃飛電馬，引十萬之眾，與天子獵於許田。軍士排開圍場，週廣二百餘里。操與天子並馬而行，只爭一馬頭。背後都是操之心腹將校。文武百官，遠遠侍從，誰敢近前。,"This expedition being decided upon they got together fleet horses, famous falcons, and pedigree hounds, and prepared bows and arrows in readiness. They mustered a strong force of guards outside the city.When the Prime Minister proposed the hunting expedition, the Emperor said he feared it was an improper thing to do.Cao Cao replied, ""In ancient times rulers made four expeditions yearly at each of the four seasons in order to show their strength. They were called Sou, Miao, Xien, and Shou, in the order of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Now that the whole country is in confusion, it would be wise to inaugurate a hunt in order to train the army. I am sure Your Majesty will approve.""So the Emperor with the full paraphernalia for an imperial hunt joined the expedition. He rode a saddled horse, carried an inlaid bow, and his quiver was filled with gold-tipped arrows. His chariot followed behind. Liu Bei and his brothers were in the imperial train, each with his bow and quiver. Each party member wore a breastplate under the outer robe and held his especial weapon, while their escort followed them. Cao Cao rode a dun horse called ""Flying-Lightning,"" and the army was one hundred thousand strong.The hunt took place in Xutian, and the legions spread out as guards round the hunting arena which extended over some one hundred square miles. Cao Cao rode even with the Emperor, the horses' heads alternating in the lead. The imperial attendants immediately following were all in Cao Cao's confidence. The other officers, civil and military, lagged behind, for they dared not press forward into the midst of Cao Cao's partisans."
當日獻帝馳馬到許田，劉玄德起居道旁。帝曰：「朕今欲看皇叔射獵。」玄德領命上馬，忽草中趕起一兔。玄德射之，一箭正中那兔。帝喝采。轉過土坡，忽見荊棘中趕出一隻大鹿。帝連射三箭不中，顧謂操曰：「卿射之。」操就討天子寶雕弓、金鈚箭，扣滿一射，正中鹿背，倒於草中。群臣將校，見了金鈚箭，只道天子射中，都踴躍向帝呼萬歲。曹操縱馬直出，遮於天子之前以迎受之。群皆失色。,"One day the Emperor was riding toward the hunting grounds and noticed his newly found uncle respectfully standing by the roadside.""I should like to see my uncle display his hunting skill,"" said the Emperor.Liu Bei mounted his steed at once. Just then a hare started from its form. Liu Bei shot and hit it with the first arrow.The Emperor, much struck by this display, rode away over a slope. Suddenly a deer broke out of the thicket. He shot three arrows at it but all missed.""You try,"" said the Emperor turning to Cao Cao.""Lend me Your Majesty's bow,"" Cao Cao replied.Taking the inlaid bow and the golden-tipped arrows, Cao Cao pulled the bow and hit the deer in the shoulder at the first shot. It fell in the grass and could not run.Now the crowd of officers seeing the golden-barbed arrow sticking in the wound concluded at once that the shot was the Emperor's, so they rushed up and shouted ""Wan sui! O Son of Heaven! Live forever!""Cao Cao rode out pushing past the Emperor and acknowledged the congratulations.They all turned pale."
玄德背後雲長大怒，剔起臥蠶眉，睜開丹鳳眼，提刀拍馬便出，要斬曹操。玄德見了，慌忙搖手送目。關公見兄如此，便不敢動。玄德欠身向操稱賀曰：「丞相神射，世所罕及！」操笑曰：「此天子洪福耳。」乃回馬向天子稱賀，竟不獻還寶雕弓，親自懸帶。,"Guan Yu, who was behind Liu Bei, was especially angry. The silkworm eyebrows stood up fiercely, and the red phoenix eyes glared as, sword in hand, he rode hastily forth to cut down the audacious Prime Minister for his impertinence.However, Liu Bei hastily waved him back and shot at him a meaning glance so that Guan Yu stopped and made no further move.Liu Bei bowing toward Cao Cao said, ""Most sincere felicitations! A truly supernatural shot, such as few have achieved!""""It is only the enormous good fortune of the Son of Heaven!"" said Cao Cao with a smile.Then he turned his steed and felicitated the Emperor. But he did not return the bow; he hung it over his own shoulder instead."
圍場已罷，宴於許田。宴畢，駕回許都。眾人各自歸歇。雲長問玄德曰：「操賊欺君罔上，我欲殺之，為國除害，兄何止我？」玄德曰：「『投鼠忌器』。操與帝相離只一馬頭，其心腹之人，週迴擁侍；吾弟若逞一時之怒，輕有舉動，倘事不成，有傷天子，罪反坐我等矣。」雲長曰：「今日不殺此賊，後必為禍。」玄德曰：「且宜秘之，不可輕言。」,"The hunt finished with banqueting; and when the entertainments were over, they returned to the capital, all glad of some repose after the expedition.Guan Yu was still angry of the Prime Minister's breach of decorum.One day Guan Yu said to Liu Bei, ""Brother, why did you prevent me from killing that rebel and so ridding the world of a scoundrel? He insults the Emperor and ignores everybody else.""""When you throw stones at a rat, beware of the vase,"" quoted Liu Bei. ""Cao Cao was only a horse's head away from Our Lord, and in the midst of a crowd of his partisans. In that momentary burst of anger, if you had struck and failed, and harm had come to the Emperor, what an awful crime would have been laid to us!""""If we do not rid the world of him today, a worse evil will come of it,"" said Guan Yu.""But be discreet, my brother. Such matters cannot be lightly discussed."""
卻說獻帝回宮，泣謂伏皇后曰：「朕自即位以來，奸雄並起；先受董卓之殃，後遭傕、汜之亂。常人未受之苦，吾與汝當之。後得曹操，以為社稷之臣；不意專國弄權，擅作威福。朕每見之，背若芒刺。今日在圍場上，身迎呼賀，無禮已極！早晚必有異謀，吾夫婦不知死所也！」伏皇后曰：「滿朝公卿，俱食漢祿，竟無一人能救國難乎？」,"The Emperor sadly returned to his palace. With tears in his eyes, he related what had occurred in the hunt to his consort, Empress Fu.""Alas for me!"" said he. ""From the first days of my accession, one vicious minister has succeeded another. I was the victim of Dong Zhuo's evil machinations. Then followed the rebellion of Li Jue and Guo Si. You and I had to bear sorrows such as no others have borne. Then came this Cao Cao as one who would maintain the imperial dignity, but he has seized upon all real authority and does as he wishes. He works continually for his own glorification, and I never see him but my back pricks. These last few days in the hunting field, he went in front of me and acknowledged the cheers of the crowd. He is so extremely rude that I feel sure he has sinister designs against me. Alas, my wife, we know not when our end may come!""""In a whole court full of nobles, who have eaten the bread of Han, is there not one who will save his country?"" said she."
言未畢，忽一人自外而入曰：「帝、后休憂：吾舉一人，可除國害。」帝視之，乃伏皇后之父伏完也。帝掩淚問曰：「皇丈亦知操賊之專橫乎？」完曰：「許田射鹿之事，誰不見之？但滿朝之中，非操宗族，則其門下。若非國戚，誰肯盡忠討賊？老臣無權，難行此事。車騎將軍國舅董承可託也。」帝曰：「董國舅多赴國難，朕躬素知；可宣入內，共議大事。」完曰：「陛下左右皆操賊心腹，倘事機泄漏，為禍不淺。」帝曰：「然則奈何？」完曰：「臣有一計，陛下可製衣一領，取玉帶一條，密賜董承；卻於帶襯內縫一密詔以賜之，令到家見詔，可以晝夜畫策；神鬼不覺矣。」,"Thus spoke the Empress, and at the same moment there stepped in a man who said, ""Grieve not, O Imperial Pair! I can find a savior for the country.""It was none other than the father of the Empress, Fu Wan.""Have you heard of Cao Cao's wanton and perverse behavior?"" said the Emperor, drying his eyes.""You mean the deer shooting? Who did not see that, indeed? But the whole court is full of his clan or his creatures. With the exception of the relatives of your Consort, there is not one loyal enough to deal with a rebel. I have no authority and can do nothing, but there is General Dong Cheng, the State Uncle, who could do it.""""Could Uncle Dong Cheng come in to consult about this? I know he has had much experience of state troubles.""Fu Wan replied, ""Everyone of your attendants is a partisan of Cao Cao, and this sort of thing must be kept most profoundly secret or the consequence will be most serious.""""Then what can be done?"" said the Emperor.""The only plan I can think of is to send gifts of a robe and a jade girdle to Dong Cheng, and in the lining of the girdle hide a secret edict authorizing him to take certain steps. When he gets home and has read the edict, he can elaborate plans as quickly as possible, and neither the spirits above nor the demons below will know anything about them."""
帝然之，伏完辭出。帝乃自作一密詔，咬破指尖，以血寫之，暗令伏皇后縫於玉帶紫錦襯內，卻自穿錦袍，自繫此帶，令內史宣董承入。承見帝禮畢，帝曰：「朕夜來與后說霸河之苦，念國舅大功，故特宣入慰勞。」承頓首謝。帝引承出殿，到太廟，轉上功臣閣內。帝焚香禮畢，引承觀畫像。中間畫漢高祖容像。帝曰：「吾高祖皇帝起身何地？如何創業？」承大驚曰：「陛下戲臣耳。聖祖之事，何為不知？高皇帝起自泗上亭長，提三尺劍，斬蛇起義，縱橫四海，三載亡秦，五年滅楚，遂有天下，立萬世之基業。,"The Emperor approved, and Fu Wan went out. The Emperor then with his own hand drew up a decree, writing it with blood drawn by biting his finger. He gave the document to Empress Fu to sew into the purple lining of the girdle. When all was done, he put on the robe and girded it with the girdle. Next he bade one of the attendants summon State Uncle Dong Cheng to the Palace.Dong Cheng came; and after the ceremonies were finished, the Emperor said, ""A few nights ago I was talking with the Empress of the terrible days of the rebellion, and we thought of your good services then, therefore we have called you in to reward you.""The minister bowed his head in thanks. Then the Emperor led Dong Cheng out of the Reception Hall to the Temple of Ancestors, and they went to the gallery of Worthy Ministers, where the Emperor burned incense and performed the usual ceremonies. After this they went to see the portraits, and among them was one of the founder of the dynasty, Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor.""Whence sprang our great ancestor, and how did he begin his great achievement?"" said the Emperor.""Your Majesty is pleased to joke with thy servant,"" said Dong Cheng, rather startled at the question. ""Who does not know the deeds of the Sacred Ancestor? He began life as a minor official in Sishang. There gripping his sword, he slew a white serpent, the beginning of his struggle for the right. Speedily he mastered the empire: In three years had destroyed Qin and, in five, also Chu. Thus he set up a dynasty that shall endure forever!"""
帝曰：「祖宗如此英雄，子孫如此懦弱，豈不可歎！」因指左右二輔之像曰：「此二人非留侯張良、酇侯蕭何耶？」承曰：「然也。高祖開基創業，實賴二人之力。」帝回顧左右較遠，乃密謂承曰：「卿亦當如此二人立於朕側。」承曰：「臣無寸功，何以當此？」帝曰：「朕想卿西都救駕之功，未嘗少忘，無可為賜。」因指所著袍帶曰：「卿當衣朕此袍，繫朕此帶，常如在朕左右也。」承頓首謝。帝解袍帶賜承，密語曰：「卿歸可細視之，勿負朕意。」,"""Such heroic forefathers! Such weakling descendants! How sad it is!"" said the Emperor.Pointing to the portraits right and left, he continued, ""Are not these two Zhang Liang, Lord of Liu, and Xiao He, Lord of Cuo?""""Certainly. The Supreme Ancestor was greatly assisted by these two.""The Emperor glanced right and left. His attendants were rather far away. Then he whispered to Dong Cheng, ""You, like these two, must stand by me.""""My poor services are of no worth. I do not compare with those men,"" said the Uncle.""I remember that you saved me at the western capital, Changan. I have never forgotten, and I could never reward you properly.""Then pointing to his own robe, the Emperor continued, ""You must wear this robe of mine, girded with my own girdle, and it will be as though you are always near your Emperor.""Dong Cheng bowed his gratitude while the Emperor, taking off the robe, presented it to his faithful minister. At the same time he whispered, ""Examine it closely when you get home, and help your Emperor carry out his intention."""
承會意，穿袍繫帶，辭帝下閣。早有人報知曹操曰：「帝與董承登功臣閣說話。」操即入朝來看。董承出閣，纔過宮門，恰遇操來；急無躲避處，只得立於路側施禮。操問曰：「國舅何來？」承曰：「適蒙天子宣召，賜以錦袍玉帶。」操問曰：「何故見賜？」承曰：「因念某舊日西都救駕之功，故有此賜。」操曰：「解帶我看。」承心知衣帶中必有密詔，恐操看破，遲延不解。操叱左右：「急解下來！」看了半晌，笑曰：「果然是條好玉帶？再脫下錦袍來借看。」,"Dong Cheng understood. He put on the robe and the girdle, took leave and left the chamber.The news of the audience for Dong Cheng had been taken to the Prime Minister, who at once went to the Palace and arrived as Dong Cheng was passing out at the Donghua Gate. They met face to face, and Dong Cheng could in nowise avoid him. Dong Cheng went to the side of the road and made his obeisance.""Where are you from, State Uncle?"" asked Cao Cao.""His Majesty summoned me into the Palace and has given me this robe and beautiful girdle.""""Why did he give you these?""""He had not forgotten that I saved his life in the old days.""""Take it off and let me see it.""Dong Cheng who knew that a secret decree was hidden away somewhere in the garments was afraid Cao Cao would notice a breach somewhere in the material, so he hesitated and did not obey. But Cao Cao called his guards, and they took off the girdle. Then Cao Cao looked it over carefully.""It certainly is a very handsome girdle,"" said he. ""Now take off the robe and let me look at that."""
承心中畏懼，不敢不從，遂脫袍獻上。操親自以手提起，對日影中細細詳看。看畢，自己穿在身上，繫了玉帶，回顧左右曰：「長短如何？」左右稱美。操謂承曰：「國舅即以此袍帶轉賜與吾，何如？」承告曰：「君恩所賜，不敢轉贈；容某別製奉獻。」操曰：「國舅受此衣帶，莫非其中有謀乎？」承驚曰：「某焉敢？丞相如要，便當留下。」操曰：「公受君賜，吾何相奪？聊為戲耳。」遂脫袍帶還承。,"Dong Cheng's heart was melting with fear, but he dared not disobey. So he handed over the robe. Cao Cao took it and held it up against the sun with his own hand and minutely examined every part of it.When he had done this, he put it on, girded it with the girdle and turning to his attendants said, ""How is it for length?""""Beautiful!"" they chorused.Turning to Dong Cheng, he said, ""Will you give these to me?""""My Prince's presents to me I dare not give to another. Let me give you another robe in its stead,"" said Dong Cheng.""Is there not some intrigue connected with these presents? I am sure there is,"" said Cao Cao.""How could I dare?"" said Dong Cheng, trembling. ""If you are so set upon it, then I must give it up.""""How could I take away what our Prince has given you? It was all a joke,"" said the Prime Minister.Cao Cao returned both robe and girdle, and their owner made the best of his way home."
承辭操歸家，至夜獨坐書院中，將袍仔細反覆看了，並無一物。承思曰：「天子賜我袍帶，命我細觀，必非無意；今不見其蹤跡，何也？」隨又取玉帶檢看，乃白玉玲瓏，碾成小龍穿花，背用紫綿為襯，縫綴端整，亦並無一物。承心疑，放於桌上，反覆尋之。良久，倦甚。正欲伏几而寢，忽然燈花落於帶上，燒著背襯。承驚拭之，已燒破一處，微露素絹，隱見血跡。急取刀拆開視之，乃天子手書血字密詔也。詔曰：,"When night came and he was alone in his library, he took out the robe and looked over every inch of it most carefully. He found nothing.""He gave me a robe and a girdle and bade me look at them carefully. That means there is something to be looked for but I can find no trace of it. What does it mean?"" he soliloquized.Then he lifted the girdle and examined that. The jade plates were carved into the semblance of small dragons interlaced among flowers. The lining was of purple silk. All was sewn together most carefully and neatly, and he could find nothing out of the common. He was puzzled. He laid the belt on the table. Presently he picked it up and looked at it again. He spent long hours over it but in vain. He leaned over on the small table, his head resting on his hands and was almost asleep, when a candle snuff fell down upon the girdle and burned a hole in the lining. He hastily shook it off, but the mischief was done: A small hole had been burned in the silken lining, and through this there appeared something white with blood red marks. He hastily ripped it open and drew out the decree written by the hand of the Emperor himself in characters of blood. It read:"
朕聞人倫之大，父子為先；尊卑之殊，君臣為重。近日操賊弄權，欺壓君父；結連黨伍，敗壞朝綱；敕賞封罰，不由朕主。朕夙夜憂思，恐天下將危。卿乃國之大臣，朕之至戚，當念高帝創業之艱難，糾合忠義兩全之烈士，殄滅奸黨，復安社稷，祖宗幸甚！破指洒血，書詔付卿，再四慎之，勿負朕意！建安四年春三月詔。,"""Of human relationships, that between parents and children stands first. Of the various social ties that between prince and minister stands highest. Today Cao Cao, the wicked, is a real tyrant, treating even his Prince with indignity. With the support of his faction and his army, he has destroyed the principles of government. By conferring rewards and inflicting punishments, he has reduced the Emperor to a nonentity. I have grieved over this day and night. I have feared the empire would be ruined.""You are a high minister of state and my own relative. You must recall the difficulties of the Great Founder's early days and draw together the loyal and right-minded to destroy this evil faction and restore the prerogatives of the Throne. Such a deed would be indeed an extreme joy to the spirits of my ancestors.""This decree, written in blood drawn from my own veins, is confided to a noble who is to be most careful not to fail in executing his Emperor's design.""Given in the era of Rebuilt Tranquillity, fourth year and the third month of spring."" (AD 199)"
董承覽畢，涕淚交流，一夜寢不能寐。晨起，復至書院中，將詔再三觀看，無計可施。乃放詔於几上，沈思滅操之計。忖量未定，隱几而臥。忽侍郎王子服至。門吏知子服與董承交厚，不敢攔阻，竟入書院。見承伏不醒，袖底壓著素絹，微露「朕」字。子服疑之，默取看畢，藏於袖中，呼承曰：「國舅好自在！虧你如何睡得著！」,"So ran the decree, and Dong Cheng read it with streaming eyes. There was no sleep for him that night. Early in the morning he returned to his library and reread it. No plan suggested itself. He laid the decree down on the table and sought in the depths of his mind for some scheme to destroy Cao Cao, but could not decide upon any. And he fell asleep leaning over his table.It happened that Minister Wang Zifu, with whom Dong Cheng was on terms of great intimacy, came to visit him and, as usual, walked into the house unannounced and went straight to the library. His host did not wake, and Wang Zifu noticed, hardly hidden by his sleeve, the Emperor's writing.Wondering what this might be, Wang Zifu drew it out, read it, and put it in his own sleeve.Then he called out loud, ""Uncle Dong Cheng, are you not well? Why are you asleep at this time of day?"""
承驚覺，不見詔書，魂不附體，手腳慌亂。子服曰：「汝欲殺曹公！吾當出首。」承泣告曰：「若兄如此，漢室休矣！」子服曰：「吾戲耳。吾祖宗世食漢祿，豈無忠心？願助兄一臂之力，共誅國賊。」承曰：「兄有此心，國之大幸。」子服曰：「當於密室同立義狀，各捨三族，以報漢君。」承大喜，取白絹一幅，先書名畫字。子服亦即書名畫字。書畢，子服曰：「將軍吳子蘭，與吾至厚，可與同謀。」承曰：「滿朝大臣，惟有長水校尉种輯、議郎吳碩是吾心腹，必能與我同事。」,"Dong Cheng started up and at once missed the decree. He was aghast; he almost fell to the ground.""So you want to make away with Cao Cao? I shall have to tell him,"" said Wang Zifu.""Then, brother, that is the end of the Hans,"" said his host, with tears.""I was joking,"" said Wang Zifu. ""My forefathers also served the Hans and ate of their bounty. Am I devoid of loyalty? I would help you, brother, as far as lies in my power.""""It is well for the country that you think like this,"" said Dong Cheng.""But we ought to have a more private place than this to talk over such plans and pledge ourselves to sacrifice all in the cause of Han.""Dong Cheng began to feel very satisfied. He produced a roll of white silk and wrote his own name at the top and signed it, and Wang Zifu followed suit.Then the visitor said, ""General Wu Zilan is one of my best friends. He ought to be allowed to come in.""Dong Cheng replied, ""Of all the officials of the court, Commander Chong Ji and Court Counselor Wu Shi are my best friends. Certainly they would back me up."""
正商議間，家僮入報种輯、吳碩來探。承曰：「此天助我也！」教子服暫避於屏後。承接二人入書院。坐定，茶畢。輯曰：「許田射獵之事，君亦懷恨乎？」承曰：「雖懷恨，無可奈何。」碩曰：「吾誓殺此賊，恨無助我者耳！」輯曰：「為國除害，雖死無怨。」王子服從屏後出曰：「汝二人欲殺曹丞相！我當出首，董國舅便是証見。」种輯怒曰：「忠臣不怕死，吾等死做漢鬼，強似你阿附國賊！」承笑曰：「吾等正為此事，欲見二公。王侍郎之言乃戲耳。」便於袖中取出詔來與二人看。二人讀詔，揮淚不止。承遂請書名。子服曰：「二公在此少待，吾去請吳子蘭來。」,"So the discussion proceeded. Presently a servant announced no other than these very two men Dong Cheng just mentioned.""This is providential,"" said Dong Cheng, and he told Wang Zifu to hide behind a screen.The two guests were led into the library, and after the exchange of the ordinary civilities and a cup of tea, Chong Ji referred to the incident at the hunt and the shooting of the stag.""Were you not angry at that?"" said Chong Ji.Dong Cheng answered, ""Though we be angry, what can we do?""Wu Shi struck in, saying, ""I would slay this fellow, I swear, but I cannot get anyone to back me up.""""One should perish for one's country; one should not mind,"" said Chong Ji.At this moment Wang Zifu appeared from behind the screen, saying, ""You two want to kill Cao Cao! I shall have to let him know this. And Uncle Dong Cheng is my witness.""""A loyal minister does not mind death. If we are killed, we will be Han ghosts, which is better than being sycophants of a traitor,"" said Chong Ji, angrily.Dong Cheng said, ""We were just saying we wanted to see you two on this matter. Wang Zifu is only joking.""Then he drew forth the decree and showed it to the two newcomers, who also wept as they read it. They were asked to add their names to the silk roll.Wang Zifu said, ""Wait here a few moments till I get Wu Zilan to come."""
子服去不多時，即同子蘭至，與眾相見，亦書名畢。承邀於後堂會飲。忽報西涼太守馬騰相探。承曰：「只推我病，不能接見。」門吏回報。騰大怒曰：「我夜來在東華門外，親見他錦袍玉帶而出，何故推病耶！吾非無事而來，奈何拒我！」門吏入報，備言騰怒。承起曰：「諸公少待，暫容承出。」隨即出廳延接。禮畢，坐定。騰曰：「騰入覲將還，故來相辭，何見拒也？」承曰：「賤軀暴疾，有失迎候，罪甚。」騰曰：「面帶春色，未見病容。」,"He left the room and very soon returned with his friend, who also wrote his name in the presence of all the others.After this they went into one of the inner chambers to drink success to the new plot. While there, a new visitor, Ma Teng, Governor of Xiliang, was announced.""Say I am indisposed,"" said the host, ""and cannot receive visitors.""The doorkeeper took the message, whereat Ma Teng angrily said, ""Last night at the Donghua Gate, I saw him come out in robe and girdle. How can he pretend illness today? I am not come from mere idleness, why does he refuse to see me?""The doorkeeper went in again and told his master what the visitor had said and that he was very angry. Then Dong Cheng rose, excused himself saying he would soon return, and went to receive Ma Teng.After the visitor had saluted and they were both seated, Ma Teng said, ""I have just come from a farewell audience and wished to bid you good bye. Why did you want to put me off?""""My poor body was taken suddenly ill. That is why I was not waiting to welcome you,"" said Dong Cheng.""You do not look as if you were ill. Your face wears the very bloom of health,"" said Ma Teng bluntly."
承無言可答。騰拂袖便起，嗟歎下階曰：「皆非救國之人也！」承感其言，挽留之，問曰：「公謂何人非救國之人？」騰曰：「許田射獵之事，吾尚氣滿胸膛；公乃國之至戚，猶自滯於酒色，而不思討賊，安得為皇家救難扶災之人乎！」承恐其詐，佯驚曰：「曹丞相乃國之大臣，朝廷所倚賴，公何出此言？」騰大怒曰：「汝尚以曹賊為好人耶？」承曰：「耳目甚近，請公低聲。」騰曰：「貪生怕死之徒，不足以論大事！」說罷，又欲起身。承知騰忠義，乃曰：「公且息怒。某請公看一物。」遂邀騰入書院，取詔示之。,"His host could say no more and was silent. The visitor shook out his sleeves and rose to depart.He sighed deeply as he walked down the steps, saying to himself, ""Not one of them is any good. There is no one to save the country.""This speech sank deeply into Dong Cheng's heart. He stopped his guest, saying, ""Who is no good to save the country? Whom do you mean?""""That incident at the hunt the other day, the shooting of the stag, filled my breast with anger. But if you, a near relative of the Emperor, can pass your time in wine and idle dalliance without a thought of doing away with rebellion, where can anyone be found who will save the dynasty?""However, Dong Cheng doubts were not set at rest. Pretending great surprise, he replied, ""The Prime Minister is of high rank and has the confidence of the court. Why then do you utter such things?""""So you find that wretch Cao Cao a good man, eh?""""Pray speak lower: There are eyes and ears very near us.""""The sort of people who covet life and fear death are not those to discuss any great undertaking.""So saying, Ma Teng rose to go sway. By this time his host's doubts were set at rest. He felt that Ma Teng was loyal.So Dong Cheng said, ""Do not be angry any more. I will show you something.""Whereupon he invited Ma Teng to go into the room where the others were seated and then showed him the decree."
騰讀畢，毛髮倒豎，咬齒嚼脣，滿口流血。謂承曰：「公若有舉動，吾即統西涼兵為外應。」承請騰與諸公相見，取出義狀，教騰書名。騰乃取酒歃血為盟曰：「吾等誓死不負所約！」指坐上五人言曰：「若得十人，大事諧矣。」承曰：「忠義之士，不可多得。若所與非人，則反相害矣。」騰教取鴛行鷺序薄來檢看。檢到劉氏宗族，乃拍手言曰：「何不共此人商議？」眾皆問何人。馬騰不慌不忙，說出那人來。正是：本因國舅承明詔，又見宗潢佐漢朝。畢竟馬騰之言如何，且聽下文分解。,"As Ma Teng read it, his hair stood on end; he ground his teeth and bit his lips till the blood came.""When you move, remember the whole force of my army is ready to help,"" said Ma Teng.Dong Cheng introduced him to the other conspirators, and then the pledge was produced, and Ma Teng was told to sign his name. He did so, at the same time smearing the blood as a sign of the oath and saying, ""I swear to die rather than betray this pledge!""Pointing to the five he said, ""We require ten for this business, and we can accomplish our design.""""We cannot get many true and loyal people. One of the wrong sort will spoil all,"" said Dong Cheng.Ma Teng told them to bring in the list of officials. He read on till he came to the name Liu, of the imperial clan, when clapping his hands he cried, ""Why not consult him?""""Whom?"" cried they altogether.Ma Teng very slowly and deliberately spoke his name.To a very trusty servant comes an Emperor's decree,And a scion of the ruling house can prove his loyalty.If the readers turns to the next chapter, they will see whom Ma Teng talked about."
