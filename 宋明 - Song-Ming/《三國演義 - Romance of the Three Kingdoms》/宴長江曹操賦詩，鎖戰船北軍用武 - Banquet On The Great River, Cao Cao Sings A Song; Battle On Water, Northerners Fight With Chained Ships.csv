卻說龐統聞言，吃了一驚；急回視其人，原來卻是徐庶。統見是故人，心下方定；回顧左右無人，乃曰：「你若說破我計，可惜江南八十一州百姓，皆是你送了也！」庶笑曰：「此間八十三萬人馬，性命如何？」統曰：「元直真欲破我計耶？」庶曰：「吾感劉皇叔厚恩，未嘗忘報。曹操逼死吾母，吾已說過終身不設一謀，今安肯破兄良策？只是我亦隨軍在此，兵敗之後，玉石不分，豈能免難？君當教我脫身之術，我即緘口遠避矣。」統笑曰：「元直如此高見遠識，諒此有何難哉！」庶曰：「願先生賜教。」統去徐庶耳邊略說數句。庶大喜，拜謝。龐統別卻徐庶下船，自回江東。,"In the last chapter Pang Tong was brought up with a sudden shock when someone seized him and said of his scheme. Upon turning to look at the man, Pang Tong saw it was Xu Shu, an old friend, and his heart revived.Looking around and seeing no one near, Pang Tong said, ""It would be a pity if you upset my plan. The fate of the people of all the eighty-one southern counties is in your hands.""Xu Shu smiled, saying, ""And what of the fate of these eight hundred thirty thousand soldiers and horse of the north?""""Do you intend to wreck my scheme, Xu Shu?""""I have never forgotten the kindness of Uncle Liu Bei, nor my oath to avenge the death of my mother at Cao Cao's hands. I have said I would never think out a plan for him. So am I likely to wreck yours now, brother? But I have followed Cao Cao's army thus far; and after they shall have been defeated, good and bad will suffer alike and how can I escape? Tell me how I can secure safety, and I sew up my lips and go away.""Pang Tong smiled, ""If you are as high-minded as that, there is no great difficulty.""""Still I wish you would instruct me.""So Pang Tong whispered something in his ear, which seemed to please Xu Shu greatly, for he thanked him most cordially and took his leave. Then Pang Tong betook himself to his boat and left for the southern shore."
且說徐庶當晚密使近人去各寨中暗布謠言。次日，寨中三三五五，交頭接耳而說。早有探事人報知曹操，說：「軍中傳言西涼州韓遂，馬騰謀反，殺奔許都來。」操大驚，急聚眾謀士商議曰：「吾引兵南征，心中所憂者，韓遂，馬騰耳。軍中謠言，雖未辨虛實，然不可不防。」,"His friend gone, Xu Shu mischievously spread certain rumors in the camp, and next day were to be seen everywhere soldiers in small groups, some talking, others listening, heads together and ears stretched out, till the camps seemed to buzz. Some of the officers went to Cao Cao and told him, saying, ""A rumor is running around the camps that Han Sui and Ma Teng are marching from Xiliang to attack the capital.""This troubled Cao Cao, who called together his advisers to council.Said he, ""The only anxiety I have felt in this expedition was about the possible doings of Han Sui and Ma Teng. Now there is a rumor running among the soldiers, and though I know not whether it be true or false, it is necessary to be on one's guard."""
言未畢，徐庶進曰：「庶蒙丞相收錄，恨無寸功報效。請得三千人馬，星夜往散關把住隘口。如有緊急，再行告報。」操喜曰：「若得元直去，吾無憂矣。散關之上，亦有軍兵，公統領之。目下撥三千軍步軍，命臧霸為先鋒，星夜前去，不可稽遲。」徐庶辭了曹操，與臧霸便行。……此便是龐統救徐庶之計。後人有詩曰：曹操征南日日憂，馬騰韓遂起戈矛。鳳雛一語教徐庶，正似游魚脫釣鉤。,"At this point Xu Shu said, ""You have been kind enough to give me an office, Sir, and I have really done nothing in return. If I may have three thousand troops, I will march at once to San Pass and guard this entrance. If there be any pressing matter, I will report at once.""""If you would do this, I should be quite at my ease. There are already troops beyond the Pass, who will be under your command, and now I will give you three thousand of horse and foot, and Zang Ba shall lead the van and march quickly.""Xu Shu took leave of the Prime Minister and left in company with Zang Ba. This was Pang Tong's scheme to secure the safety of Xu Shu.A poem says:Cao Cao marched south, but at his backThere rode the fear of rear attack.Pang Tong's good counsel Xu Shu took,And thus the fish escaped the hook."
曹操自遣徐庶去後，心中稍安，遂上馬先看沿江旱寨，次看水寨。乘大船一隻，於中央上建「帥」字旗號，兩傍皆列水寨，船上埋伏弓弩千張。操居於上。時建安十二年冬十一月十五日，天氣晴明，平風靜浪。操令：「置酒設樂於大船之上，吾今夕欲會諸將」。,"Cao Cao's anxiety diminished after he had thus sent away Xu Shu. Then he rode round all the camps, first the land forces and then the naval. He boarded one of the large ships and thereon set up his standard. The naval camps were arranged along two lines, and every ship carried a thousand bows and crossbows.While Cao Cao remained with the fleet, it occurred the full moon of the eleventh month of the thirteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 208). The sky was clear; there was no wind; and the river lay unruffled. He prepared a great banquet, with music, and thereto invited all his leaders."
天色向晚，東山月上，皎皎如同白日。長江一帶，如橫素練。操坐大船之上，左右侍御者數百人，皆錦衣繡襖，荷戈執戟。文武眾官，各依次而坐。操見南屏山色如畫，東視柴桑之境，西觀夏口之江，南望樊山，北覷烏林，四顧空闊，心中歡喜，謂眾官曰：「吾自起義兵以來，與國家除兇去害，誓願掃清四海，削平天下；所未得者江南也。今吾有百萬雄師，更賴諸公用命，何患不成功耶？收服江南之後，天下無事，與諸公共享富貴，以樂太平。」文武皆起謝曰：「願得早奏凱歌。我等終身皆賴丞相福蔭。」操大喜，命左右行酒。,"As evening drew on, the moon rose over the eastern hills in its immaculate beauty, and beneath it lay the broad belt of the river like a band of pure silk. It was a great assembly, and all the guests were clad in gorgeous silks and embroidered robes, and the arms of the fighting soldiers glittered in the moonlight. The officers, civil and military, were seated in their proper order of precedence.The setting, too, was exquisite. The Southern Hills were outlined as in a picture; the boundaries of Chaisang lay in the east; the river showed west as far as Xiakou; on the south lay the Fan Mountains, on the north was the Black Forest. The view stretched wide on every side.Cao Cao's heart was jubilant, and he harangued the assembly, saying, ""My one aim since I enlisted my first small band of volunteers has been the removal of evil from the state, and I have sworn to cleanse the country and restore tranquillity. Now there is only left this land of the south to withstand me. I am at the head of a hundred legions. I depend upon you, gentlemen, and have no doubt of my final success. After I have subdued the South Land, there will be no trouble in all the country. Then we shall enjoy wealth and honor and revel in peace.""They rose in a body and expressed their appreciation, saying, ""We trust that you may soon report complete victory, and we shall all repose in the shade of your good fortune.""In his elation, Cao Cao bade the servants bring more wine."
飲至半夜，操酒酣，遙指南岸曰：「周瑜，魯肅，不識天時。今幸有投降之人，為彼心腹之患，此天助吾也。」荀攸曰：「丞相勿言，恐有泄漏。」操大笑曰：「座上諸公，與近侍左右，皆吾心腹之人也，，言之何礙？」又指夏口曰：「劉備，諸葛亮，汝不料螻蟻之力，欲撼泰山，何其愚耶！」顧謂諸將曰：「吾今年五十四歲矣。如得江南，竊有所喜。昔日喬公與吾至契，吾知其二女皆有國色。後不料為孫策，周瑜，所娶。吾今新構銅雀臺於漳水之上，如得江南，當娶二喬，置之臺上，以娛暮年，吾願足矣。」言罷大笑。唐人杜牧之有詩曰：折戟沈沙鐵未消，自將磨洗認前朝。東風不與周郎便，銅雀春深鎖二喬。,"They drank till late at night. Warmed and mellowed, the host pointed to the south bank, saying, ""Zhou Yu and Lu Su know not the appointed time. Heaven is aiding me bringing upon them the misfortune of the desertion of their most trusted friends.""""O Prime Minister, say nothing of these things lest they become known to the enemy,"" said Xun You.But the Prime Minister only laughed.""You are all my trusty friends,"" said he, ""both officers and humble attendants. Why should I refrain?""Pointing to Xiakou, he continued, ""You do not reckon for much with your puny force, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. How foolish of you to attempt to shake the Taishan Mountains!""Then turning to his officers, he said, ""I am now fifty-four; and if I get the South Land, I shall have the wherewithal to rejoice. In the days of long ago, the Patriarch Duke Qiao in the south and I were great friends, and we came to an agreement on certain matters, for I knew his two daughters —-Elder Qiao and Younger Qiao —-were lovely beyond words. Then by some means, they became wives to Sun Ce and Zhou Yu. But now my palace of rest is built on the River Zhang, and victory over the South Land will mean that I marry these two fair women. I will put them in the Bronze Bird Tower, and they shall rejoice my declining years. My desires will then be completely attained.""He smiled at the anticipation.Du Mu, a famous poet of the Tang Dynasty, in one poem says:A broken halberd buried in the sand,With deep rust eaten,Loud tells of ancient battles on the strand,When Cao Cao was beaten.Had eastern winds Zhou Yu's plan refused to aidAnd fan the blaze,The two fair Qiaos, in the Bronze Bird's shade,Would have been locked at spring age."
曹操正笑談間，忽聞鴉聲望南飛鳴而去。操問曰：「此鴉緣何夜鳴？」左右答曰：「鴉見月明，疑是天曉，故離樹而鳴也。」操又大笑。時操已醉，乃取槊立於船上，以酒奠於江中，滿飲三爵，橫槊謂諸將曰：「我持此槊破黃巾，擒呂布，滅袁術，收袁紹，深入塞北，直抵遼東，縱橫天下：頗不負大丈之志也。今對此景，甚有慷慨。吾當作歌，汝等和之。」歌曰：對酒當歌，人生幾何？譬如朝露，去日苦多。慨當以慷，憂思難忘。何以解憂，惟有杜康。青青子衿，悠悠我心。呦呦鹿鳴，食野之苹。我有嘉賓，鼓瑟吹笙。皎皎如月，何時可輟？憂從中來，不可斷絕。越陌度阡，枉用相存。契闊談讌，心念舊恩。月明星稀，烏鵲南飛，遶樹三匝，無枝可依。山不厭高，水不厭深。周公吐哺，天下歸心。,"But suddenly amid the merriment was heard the hoarse cry of a raven flying toward the south.""Why does the raven thus cry in the night?"" said Cao Cao to those about him.""The moon is so bright that it thinks it is day,"" said they, ""and so it leaves its tree.""Cao Cao laughed. By this time he was quite intoxicated. He set up his spear in the prow of the ship and poured a libation into the river and then drank three brimming goblets.As he lowered the spear, he said, ""This is the spear that broke up the Yellow Scarves, captured Lu Bu, destroyed Yuan Shao, and subdued Yuan Shu, whose armies are now mine. In the north it reached to Liaodong, and it stretched out over the whole south. It has never failed in its task. The present scene moves me to the depths, and I will sing a song in which you shall accompany me.""And so he sang:""When goblets are brimming then sang is near birth,But life is full short and has few days of mirth,Life goes as the dew drops fly swiftly away,Beneath the glance of the glowing hot ruler of day.Human's life may be spent in the noblest enterprise,But sorrowful thoughts in his heart oft arise.Let us wash clean away the sad thoughts that intrude,With bumpers of wine such as Du Kang once brewed.Gone is my day of youthful fireAnd still ungained is my desire.The deer feed on the level plainAnd joyful call, then feed again.My noble guests are gathered round.The air is trilled with joyful sound.Bright my future lies before me.As the moonlight on this plain;But I strive in vain to reach it.When shall I my wish attain?None can answer; and so sadnessGrips my inmost heart again.Far north and south,Wide east and west,We safety seek;Vain is the quest.Human's heart oft yearnsFor converse sweet.And my heart burnsWhen old friends greet.The stars are paled by the full moon's light,The raven wings his southward flight.And thrice he circles round a tree,No place thereon to rest finds he.They weary not the mountains of great height,The waters deep of depth do not complain,Duke Zhou no leisure found by day or nightStern toil is his who would the empire gain."""
歌罷，眾和之，共皆歡笑。忽座間一人進曰：「大軍相當之際，將士用命之時，丞相何故出此不吉之言？」操視之，乃揚州刺史，沛國相人：姓劉，名馥，字元穎。馥起自合淝，創立州治，聚逃散之民，立學校，廣屯田，興治教，久事曹操，多立功績。當下操橫槊問曰：「吾言有何不吉？」馥曰：「『月明星稀，烏鵲南飛，遶樹三匝，無枝可依。』此不吉之言。」操大怒曰：「汝安敢敗吾興！」手起一槊，刺死劉馥。眾皆驚駭，遂罷宴。,"The song made they sang it with him and were all exceedingly merry, save one guest who suddenly said, ""When the great army is on the point of battle and lives are about to be risked, why do you, O Prime Minister, speak such ill words?""Cao Cao turned quickly toward the speaker, who was Liu Fu, Imperial Protector of Yangzhou. This Liu Fu sprang from Hefei. When first appointed to his post, he had gathered in the terrified and frightened people and restored order. He had founded schools and encouraged the people to till the land. He had long served under Cao Cao and rendered valuable service.When Liu Fu spoke, Cao Cao dropped his spear to the level and said, ""What ill-omened words did I use?""""You spoke of the moon paling the stars and the raven flying southward without finding a resting place. These are ill-omened words.""""How dare you try to belittle my endeavor?"" cried Cao Cao, very wrathful. And with that he smote Liu Fu with his spear and slew him.The assembly broke up, and the guests dispersed in fear and confusion."
次日，操酒醒，懊恨不已。馥子劉熙，告請父屍歸葬。操泣曰：「吾昨因醉誤傷汝父，悔之無及。可以三公厚禮葬之。」又撥軍士護送靈柩，即日回葬。,"Next day, when Cao Cao had recovered from his drunken bout, he was very grieved at what he had done. When the murdered man's son, Liu Xi, came to crave the body of his father for burial, Cao Cao wept and expressed his sorrow.""I am guilty of your father's death. I was drunk yesterday. I regret the deed exceedingly. Your father shall be interred with the honors of a minister of the highest rank.""Cao Cao sent an escort of soldiers to take the body to the homeland for burial."
次日，水軍都督毛玠，于禁，詣帳下，請曰：「大小船隻，俱已配搭連鎖停當。旌旗戰具，一一齊備。請丞相調遣，剋日進兵。」,"A few days after, the two leaders of the naval force, Mao Jie and Yu Jin, came to say the ships were all connected together by chains as had been ordered, and all was now ready. They asked for the command to start."
操至水軍中央大戰船上坐定，喚集諸將，各各聽令。水旱二軍，俱分五色旗號。水軍中央黃旗毛玠，于禁，前軍紅軍張郃，後軍皂旗呂虔，左軍青旗文聘，右軍白旗呂通。馬步前軍紅旗徐晃，後軍皂旗李典，左軍青旗樂進，右軍白旗夏侯淵。水陸路都接應使夏侯惇，曹洪；護衛往來監戰使，許褚，張遼。其餘驍將，各依隊伍。,"Thereupon the leaders of both land and naval forces were assembled on board a large ship in the center of the squadron to receive orders. The various armies and squadrons were distinguished by different flags: Mao Jie and Yu Jin led the central naval squadron with yellow flag; Zhang He, the leading squadron, red flag; Lu Qian, the rear squadron, black flag; Wen Ping, the left squadron, blue flag; and Li Tong, the right squadron, white flag. On shore Xu Huang commanded the horsemen with red flag; Li Dian, the vanguard, black flag; Yue Jing, the left wing, blue flag; and Xiahou Yuan, the right wing, white flag. Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong were in reserve, and the general staff was under the leadership of Xu Chu and Zhang Liao. The other leaders were ordered to remain in camps, but ready for action."
令畢，水軍寨中發擂三通，各隊伍戰船，分門而出。是日西北風驟起，各船拽起風帆，衝波激浪，穩如平地。北軍在船上，踴躍施勇，刺鎗使刀。前後左右各軍，旗旛不雜。又有小船五十餘隻，往來巡警催督。操立於將臺之上，觀看調練，心中大喜，以為必勝之法；教且收住帆慢，各依次序回寨。操升帳謂眾謀士曰：「若非天命助吾，安得鳳雛妙計？鐵索連舟，果然渡江如屐平地。」程昱曰：「船皆連鎖，固是平穩；但彼若用火攻，難以迴避。不可不防。」操大笑曰：「程仲德雖有遠慮，卻還有見不到處。」荀攸曰：「仲德之言甚是。丞相何故笑之？」,"All being ready, the squadron drums beat the roll thrice, and the ships sailed out under a strong northwest wind on a trial cruise. When they got among the waves, they were found to be as steady and immovable as the dry land itself. The northern soldiers showed their delight at the absence of motion by capering and flourishing their weapons. The ships moved on, the squadrons keeping quite distinct. Fifty light cruisers sailed to and fro keeping order and urging progress.Cao Cao watched his navy from the Command Terrace and was delighted with their evolutions and maneuvers. Surely this meant complete victory. He ordered the recall and the squadrons returned in perfect order to their base.Then Cao Cao went to his tent and summoned his advisers.He said, ""If Heaven had not been on my side, should I have got this excellent plan from the Young Phoenix? Now that the ships are attached firmly to each other, one may traverse the river as easily as walking on firm earth.""""The ships are firmly attached to each other,"" said Cheng Yu, ""but you should be prepared for an attack by fire so that they can scatter to avoid it.""Cao Cao laughed.""You look a long way ahead,"" said he, ""but you see what cannot happen.""""Cheng Yu speaks much to the point, my lord,"" said Xun You. ""Why do you laugh at him?"""
操曰：「凡用火攻，必藉風力。方今隆冬之際，但有西風北風，安有東風南風耶？吾居於西北之上，彼兵皆在南岸，彼若用火，是燒自己之兵也，吾何懼哉？若是十月小春之時，吾早已提備矣。」諸拜皆伏拜曰：「丞相高見，眾人不及。」操顧諸將曰：「青，徐，燕，代之眾，不慣乘舟。今非此計，安能涉大江之險！」只見班部中，二將挺身出曰：「小將雖幽，燕之人，也能乘舟。今願借巡船二十隻，直至北江口，奪旗鼓而還，以顯北軍亦能乘舟也。」,"Cao Cao said, ""Anyone using fire depends upon the wind. This is now winter and only west winds blow. You will get neither east nor south winds. I am on the northwest, and the enemy is on the southeast bank. If they use fire, they will destroy themselves. I have nothing to fear. If it was the tenth moon, or early spring, I would provide against fire.""""The Prime Minister is indeed wise,"" said the others in chorus. ""None can equal him.""""With northern troops unused to shipboard, I could never have crossed the river but for this chaining plan,"" said Cao Cao.Then he saw two of the secondary leaders stand up, and they said, ""We are from the north, but we are also sailors. Pray give us a small squadron, and we will seize some of the enemy's flags and drums for you that we may prove ourselves adepts on the water."""
操視之，乃袁紹手下舊將焦觸，張南也。操曰：「汝等皆生長北方，恐乘舟不便。江南之兵，往來水上，習練精熟，汝勿輕以性命為兒戲也。」焦觸，張南大叫曰：「如其不勝，甘受軍法。」操曰：「戰船盡已連鎖，惟有小舟。每舟可容二十人，只恐未便接戰。」觸曰：「若用大船，何足為奇？乞付小舟二十餘隻。某與張南各引一半，只今日直抵江南水寨，須要奪旗斬將而還。」操曰：「吾與汝二十隻船，差撥精銳軍五百人，皆長槍硬弩。到來日天明，將大寨船出到江面上，遠為之勢。更差文聘亦領三十隻巡船接應汝回。」,"The speakers were two men who had served under Yuan Shao, named Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng.""I do not think naval work would suit you two, born and brought up in the north,"" said Cao Cao. ""The southern soldiers are thoroughly accustomed to ships. You should not regard your lives as a child's plaything.""They cried, ""If we fail, treat us according to army laws!""""The fighting ships are all chained together, there are only small, twenty-men boats free. They are unsuitable for fighting.""""If we took large ships, where would be the wonderful in what we will do? No! Give us a score of the small ships, and we will take half each and go straight to the enemy's naval port. We will just seize a flag, slay a leader, and come home.""""I will let you have the twenty ships and five hundred of good, vigorous marines with long spears and stiff crossbows. Early tomorrow the main fleet shall make a demonstration on the river, and I will also tell Wen Ping to support you with thirty ships."""
焦觸，張南，欣喜而退。次日四更造飯，五更結束已定，早聽得水寨中擂鼓鳴金。船皆出寨，分布水面。長江一帶，青紅旗號交雜。焦觸，張南，領哨船二十隻，穿寨而出，望江南進發。,"The two men retired greatly elated.Next morning, very early, food was prepared, and at the fifth watch all was ready for a start. Then from the naval camp rolled out the drums and the gongs clanged, as the ships moved out and took up their positions, the various flags fluttering in the morning breeze. And the two intrepid leaders with their squadron of small scouting boats went down the lines and out into the stream."
卻說南岸隔日聽得鼓聲喧震，次望曹操調練水軍，探事人報知周瑜。瑜往山頂觀之，操軍已收回。次日，忽又聞鼓聲震天，軍士急登高觀望，見有小船衝波而來，飛報中軍。周瑜問帳下誰敢先出。韓當、周泰二人齊出曰：「某當權為先鋒破敵。」瑜喜，傳令各寨嚴加守禦，不可輕動。韓當，周泰，各引哨船五隻，分左右而出。,"Now a few days before the sound of Cao Cao's drums had been heard on the southern bank, Zhou Yu had watched the maneuvers of the northern fleet on the open river from the top of a hill till the fleet had gone in again. So when the sound of drums was again heard, all the southern army went up the hills to watch the northern fleet. All they saw was a squadron of small ships bounding over the waves. As the northern fleet came nearer, the news was taken to Zhou Yu who called for volunteers to go out against them. Han Dang and Zhou Tai offered themselves. They were accepted and orders were issued to the camps to remain ready for action but not to move till told.Han Dang and Zhou Tai sailed out each with a small squadron of five ships in line."
卻說焦觸，張南，憑一勇之氣，飛棹小船而來。韓當胸披掩心，手執長槍，立於船頭。焦觸船先到，便命軍士亂箭望韓當船上射來。當用牌遮隔。焦觸挺長槍與韓當交鋒。當手起一槍，刺死焦觸。張南隨後大叫趕來。刺斜裏周泰船出。張南挺槍立於船頭，兩邊弓矢亂射。周泰一臂挽牌，一手提刀。兩船相離七八尺，泰即飛身一躍，直躍過張南船上，手起刀落，砍張南於水中，亂殺駕舟軍士。眾船飛棹急回。韓當，周泰，催船追趕，到半江中，恰與文聘船相迎。兩邊便擺定船廝殺。,"The two braggarts from the north, Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng, really only trusted to their boldness and luck. Their ships came down under the powerful strokes of the oars. As they neared, the two leaders put on their heart-protectors, gripped their spears, and each took his station in the prow of the leading ship of his division. Jiao Chu's ship led and as soon as he came near enough, his troops began to shoot at Han Dang, who fended off the arrows with his buckler. Jiao Chu twirled his long spear as he engaged his opponent. But, at the first thrust, he was killed.His comrade Zhang Neng with the other ships was coming up with great shouts, when Zhou Tai sailed up at an angle, and these two squadrons began shooting arrows at each other in clouds. Zhou Tai fended off the arrows with his shield and stood gripping his sword firmly till his ships came within a few spans of the enemy's ships, when he leaped across and cut down Zhang Neng. Zhang Neng's dead body fell into the water. Then the battle became confused, and the attacking ships rowed hard to get away. The southerners pursued but soon came in sight of Wen Ping's supporting fleet. Once more the ships engaged and the forces fought with each other."
卻說周瑜引眾將立於山頂，遙望江北水面艨艟戰船，排合江上，旗幟號帶，皆有次序；回看文聘與韓當，周泰相持。韓當，周泰奮力攻擊，文聘抵敵不住，回船而走。韓，周二人，急催船追趕。周瑜恐二人深入重地，便將白旗招颭，令眾鳴金。二人乃揮棹而回。,"Zhou Yu with his officers stood on the summit of a mountain and watched his own and the enemy ships out on the river. The flags and the ensigns were all in perfect order. Then he saw Wen Ping and his own fleets engaged in battle, and soon it was evident that the former was not a match for his own sailors. Wen Ping turned about to retire, Han Dang and Zhou Tai pursued. Zhou Yu fearing lest his sailors should go too far, then hoisted the white flag of recall."
周瑜於山頂看隔江戰船，盡入水寨。瑜顧謂眾將曰：「江北戰船，如蘆葦之密；操又多謀；當用何計以破之？」眾未及對，忽見曹操寨中，被風吹折中央黃旗，飄入江中。瑜大笑曰：「此不祥之兆也！」,"To his officers Zhou Yu said, ""The masts of the northern ships stand thick as reeds. Cao Cao himself is full of wiles. How can we destroy him?""No one replied, for just then the great yellow flag that flapped in the breeze in the middle of Cao Cao's fleet suddenly fell over into the river.Zhou Yu laughed.""That is a bad omen,"" said he."
正觀之際，忽狂風大作，江中波濤拍岸。一陣風過，刮起旗角於周瑜臉上拂過。瑜猛然想起一事在心，大叫一聲，往後便倒，口吐鮮血。諸將急救起時，卻早不省人事。正是：一時忽笑又忽叫，難使南軍破北軍。畢竟周瑜性命如何，且看下文分解。,"Then an extra violent blast of wind came by, and the waves rose high and beat upon the bank. A corner of his own flag flicked Zhou Yu on the cheek, and suddenly a thought flashed through his mind. Zhou Yu uttered a loud cry, staggered, and fell backward. They picked him up. There was blood upon his lips, and he was unconscious. Presently, however, he revived.And once he laughed, then gave a cry,This is hard to ensure a victory.Zhou Yu's fate will appear as the story unfolds."
