卻說周瑜聞諸葛瑾之言，轉恨孔明，存心欲謀殺之。次日點齊軍將，入辭孫權。權曰：「卿先行，孤即起兵繼後。」瑜辭出，與程普，魯肅，領兵起行，便邀孔明同往。孔明欣然從之，一同登舟，駕起帆檣，迤邐望夏口而進。離三江口五六十里，船依次第歇定。周瑜在中央下寨，岸上依西山結營，週圍屯住。孔明只在一葉小舟內安身。,"Zhou Yu was very annoyed by the words of Zhuge Jin, and a fierce hatred for Zhuge Liang took root in his heart. He nourished a secret resolve to make away with Zhuge Liang. He continued his preparations for war, and when the troops were all mustered and ready, he went in for a farewell interview with his lord.""You go on first, Noble Sir,"" said Sun Quan. ""I will then march to support you.""Zhou Yu took his leave and then, with Cheng Pu and Lu Su, marched out with the army. He invited Zhuge Liang to accompany the expedition, and when Zhuge Liang cheerfully accepted, the four embarked in the same ship. They set sail, and the fleet made for Xiakou.About twenty miles from Three Gorges the fleet anchored near the shore, and Zhou Yu built a stockade on the bank near the middle of their line with the Western Hills as a support. Other camps were made near his. Zhuge Liang, however, took up his quarters in a small ship."
周瑜分撥已定，使人請孔明議事。孔明至中軍帳，敘禮畢。瑜曰：「昔曹操兵少，袁紹兵多，而操反勝紹者，因用許攸之謀，先斷烏巢之糧也。今操兵八十三萬，我兵只五六萬，安能拒之？亦必須先斷操之糧，然後可破。我已探知操軍糧草，俱屯於聚鐵山。先生久居漢上，熟知地理。敢煩先生與關，張，子龍，輩－吾亦助兵千人－星夜往聚鐵山斷操糧道。彼此各為主人之事，幸勿推調。」,"When the camp dispositions were complete, Zhou Yu sent to request Zhuge Liang to come and give him advice. Zhuge Liang came.After the salutations were ended, Zhou Yu said, ""Cao Cao, though he had fewer troops than Yuan Shao, nevertheless overcame Yuan Shao because he followed the advice given by Xun You to destroy Yuan Shao's supplies at Wuchao. Now Cao Cao has over eight hundred thousand troops while I have but fifty or sixty thousand. In order to defeat him, his supplies must be destroyed first. I have found out that the main depot is at the Iron Pile Mountains. As you have lived hereabout, you know the topography quite well, and I wish to entrust the task of cutting off supplies to you and your colleagues Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Zilong. I will assist you with a thousand soldiers. I wish you to start without delay. In this way we can best serve our masters."""
孔明暗思：「此因說我不動，設計害我。我若推調，必為所笑。不如應之，別有計議。」乃欣然領諾。瑜大喜。孔明辭出。魯肅密謂瑜曰：「公使孔明劫糧，是何意見？」瑜曰：「吾欲殺孔明，恐惹人笑，故借曹操之手殺之，以絕後患耳。」,"Zhuge Liang saw through this at once. He thought to himself, ""This is a ruse in revenge for my not having been persuaded to enter the service of the South Land. If I refuse, I shall be laughed at. So I will do as he asks and trust to find some means of deliverance from the evil he intends.""Therefore Zhuge Liang accepted the task with alacrity, much to the joy of Zhou Yu.After the leader of the expedition had taken his leave, Lu Su went to Zhou Yu secretly and said, ""Why have you set him this task?""""Because I wish to compass his death without appearing ridiculous. I hope to get him killed by the hand of Cao Cao and prevent his doing further mischief."""
肅聞言，乃往見孔明，看他知也不知。只見孔明略無難色，整點軍馬要行。肅不忍，以言挑之曰：「先生此去可成功否？」孔明笑曰：「吾水戰，步戰，馬戰，車戰，各盡其妙，何愁功績不成？非比江東，公與周郎輩止一能也。」肅曰：「吾與公瑾何謂一能？」孔明曰：「吾聞江南小兒謠言云：「伏路把關饒子敬，臨江水戰有周郎。」公等於陸地但能伏路把關；周公瑾但堪水戰，不能陸戰耳。」,"Lu Su left and went to see Zhuge Liang to find out if he suspected anything. Lu Su found him looking quite unconcerned and getting the soldiers ready to march.Unable to let Zhuge Liang go without a warning, however, Lu Su put a tentative question, ""Do you think this expedition will succeed?""Zhuge Liang laughingly replied, ""I am an adept at all sorts of fighting, with foot, horse, and chariots on land and marines on the water. There is no doubt of my success. I am not like you and your friend, only capable in one direction.""""What do you mean by our being capable only in one direction?"" said Lu Su.""I have heard the street children in your country singing:""To lay an ambush, hold a pass,Lu Su is the man to choose;But when you on the water fight,Zhou Yu is the man to use.""You are only fit for ambushes and guarding passes on land, just as Zhou Yu only understands fighting on the water,"" said Zhuge Liang."
肅乃以此言告知周瑜。瑜怒曰：「何欺我不能陸戰耶！不用他去！我自引一萬馬軍，往聚鐵山斷操糧道。」肅又將此言告孔明。孔明笑曰：「公瑾令吾斷糧者，實欲使曹操殺吾耳。吾故以片言戲之，公瑾便容納不下。目今用人之際，只願吳侯與劉使君同心，則功可成；如各相謀害，大事休矣。操賊多謀，他平生慣斷人糧道，今如何不以重兵提備？公瑾若去，必為所擒。今只當先決水戰，挫動北軍銳氣，別尋妙計破之。望子敬善言，以告公瑾為幸。」,"Lu Su carried this story to Zhou Yu, which only incensed him the more against Zhuge Liang.""How dare he flout me, saying I cannot fight a land battle? I will not let him go. I will go myself with ten thousand troops and cut off Cao Cao's supplies.""Lu Su went back and told this to Zhuge Liang, who smiled and said, ""Zhou Yu only wanted me to go on this expedition because he wanted Cao Cao to kill me. And so I teased him a little. But he cannot bear that. Now is the critical moment, and Marquis Sun Quan and my master must act in harmony if we are to succeed. If each one tries to harm the other, the whole scheme will fail. Cao Cao is no fool, and it is he who usually attack enemies through cutting off their supplies. Do you not think Cao Cao has already taken double precautions against any surprise of his own depot? If Zhou Yu tries, he will be taken prisoner. What he ought to do is to bring about a decisive naval battle, whereby to dishearten the northern soldiers, and then find some other means to defeat them utterly. If you could persuade him what his best course was, it would be well."""
魯肅遂連夜回見周瑜，備述孔明之言。瑜搖首頓足曰：「此人見識，勝吾十倍，今不除之，後必為我國之禍！」肅曰：「今用人之際，望以國家為重。且待破曹之後，圖之未晚。」瑜然其說。,"Without loss of time, Lu Su went to Zhou Yu to relate what Zhuge Liang had told him.Zhou Yu shook his head when he heard it and beat the ground with his foot, saying, ""This man is far too clever. He beats me ten to one. He will have to be done away with, or the South Land will suffer.""Said Lu Su, ""This is the moment to use people. You must think of the country's good first of all. When once Cao Cao is defeated, you may do as you please.""Zhou Yu had to confess the reasonableness of this."
卻說玄德分付劉琦守江夏，自領眾將引兵往夏口。遙望江南岸旗旛隱隱，戈戟重重，料是東吳已動兵矣。乃盡移江夏之兵，至樊口屯紮。玄德聚眾曰：「孔明一去東吳，杳無音信，不知事體何如。誰人可去探聽虛實回報？」糜竺曰：「竺願往。」,"Liu Bei had ordered his nephew Liu Qi to hold Jiangxia, while he and the bulk of the army returned to Xiakou. Thence he saw the opposite bank thick with banners and flags and glittering with every kind of arms and armors. He knew then that the expedition from the South Land had started. So he moved all his force from Jiangxia to Fankou.Then he assembled his officers and said to them, ""Zhuge Liang went to Wu some time ago, and no word has come from him, so I know not how the business stands. Will anyone volunteer to go to find out?""""I will go,"" said Mi Zhu."
玄德乃備羊酒禮物，令糜竺至東吳，以犒軍為名，探聽虛實。竺領命，駕小舟順流而下，逕至周瑜大寨前。軍士入報周瑜，瑜召入。竺再拜，致玄德相敬之意，獻上酒禮。瑜受訖，設宴款待糜竺。竺曰：「孔明在此已久，今願與同回。」瑜曰：「孔明方與我同謀破曹，豈可便去？吾亦欲見劉豫州，共議良策；奈身統大軍，不可暫離。若豫州肯枉駕來臨，深慰所望。」,"So presents were prepared and gifts of flesh and wine, and Mi Zhu prepared to journey to the South Land on the pretext of offering a congratulatory feast to the army. He set out in a small ship and went down river. He stopped opposite the camp, and the soldiers reported his arrival to Zhou Yu, who ordered him to be brought in. Mi Zhu bowed low and expressed the respect which Liu Bei had for Zhou Yu and offered the various gifts. The ceremony of reception was followed by a banquet in honor of the guest.Mi Zhu said, ""Zhuge Liang has been here a long time, and I desire that he may return with me.""""Zhuge Liang is making plans with me, and I could not let him return,"" said Zhou Yu. ""I also wish to see Liu Bei that we may make joint plans. But when one is at the head of a great army, one cannot get away even for a moment. If your master would only come here, it would be very gracious on his part."""
竺應諾，拜辭而回。肅問瑜曰：「公欲見玄德，有何計議？」瑜曰：「玄德世之梟雄，不可不除。吾今乘機誘至殺之，實為國家除一後患。」魯肅再三勸諫，瑜只不聽，遂傳密令：「如玄德至，先埋伏刀斧手五十人於壁衣中，看我擲杯為號，便出下手。」,"Mi Zhu agreed that Liu Bei might come and presently took his leave.Then Lu Su asked Zhou Yu, ""What is your reason for desiring Liu Bei to come?""""Liu Bei is the one bold and dangerous man and must be removed. I am taking this opportunity to persuade him to come. When he shall be slain, a great danger will cease to threaten our interests.""Lu Su tried to dissuade him from this scheme, but Zhou Yu was deaf to all Lu Su said.Zhou Yu even issued orders: ""Arrange half a hundred executioners to be ready to hide within the lining of the tent if Liu Bei decides to come; and when I drop a cup, that will be a signal for them to fall on and slay him."""
卻說糜竺回見玄德，具言周瑜欲請主公到彼面會，別有商護。玄德便教收拾快船一隻，只今便行。雲長諫曰：「周瑜多謀之士，又無孔明書信，恐其中有詐，不可輕去。」玄德曰：「我今結東吳以共破曹操，周郎欲見我，我若不往，非同盟之意。兩相猜忌，事不諧矣。」雲長曰：「兄長若堅意要去，弟願同往。」張飛曰：「我也跟去。」玄德曰：「只雲長隨我去。翼德與子龍守寨，簡雍固守鄂縣。我去便回。」,"Mi Zhu returned and told Liu Bei that his presence was desired by Zhou Yu. Suspecting nothing, Liu Bei at once ordered them to prepare a fast vessel to take him without loss of time.Guan Yu was opposed to his going, saying, ""Zhou Yu is artful and treacherous, and there is no news from Zhuge Liang. Pray think more carefully.""Liu Bei replied, ""I have joined my forces to theirs in this attack on our common enemy. If Zhou Yu wishes to see me and I refuse to go, it is a betrayal. Nothing will succeed if both sides nourish suspicions.""""If you have finally decided to go, then will I go with you,"" said Guan Yu.""And I also,"" cried Zhang Fei.But Liu Bei said, ""Let Guan Yu come with me while you and Zhao Zilong keep guard. Jian Yong will hold Exian. I shall not be away long."""
分付畢，即與雲長乘小舟，并從者二十餘人，飛棹赴江東。玄德觀看江東艨艟戰艦，旌旗甲兵，左右分布整齊，心中甚喜。軍士飛報周瑜：「劉豫州來了。」瑜問：「帶多少船隻來？」軍士答曰：「只有一隻船，二十餘從人。」瑜笑曰：「此人命合休笑！」乃命刀斧手，先埋伏定，然後出寨迎接。,"So leaving these orders, Liu Bei embarked with Guan Yu on a small boat. The escort did not exceed twenty. The light craft traveled very quickly down the river. Liu Bei rejoiced greatly at the sight of the war vessels in tiers by the bank, the soldiers in their breastplates, and all the pomp and panoply of war. All was in excellent order.As soon as he arrived, the guards ran to tell Zhou Yu.""How many ships has he?"" asked Zhou Yu.They replied, ""Only one; and the escort is only about a score.""""His fate is sealed,"" said Zhou Yu.Zhou Yu sent for the executioners and placed them in hiding between the outer and inner tents, and when all was arranged for the assassination he contemplated, he went out to receive his visitor."
玄德引雲長等二十餘人，直到中軍帳，敘禮畢。瑜請玄德上坐。玄德曰：「將軍名傳天下，備不才，何煩將軍重禮？」乃分賓主而坐，周瑜設宴相待。,"Liu Bei came with his brother and escort into the midst of the army to the Admiral's tent.After the salutations, Zhou Yu wished Liu Bei to take the upper seat, but he declined saying, ""General, you are famous throughout all the empire, while I am a nobody. Do not overwhelm me with too great deference.""So they took the positions of simple friends, and refreshments were brought in."
且說孔明偶來江邊，聞說玄德來此與都督相會，吃了一驚，急入中軍帳竊看動靜。只見周瑜面有殺氣，兩邊壁衣中密排刀斧手。孔明大驚曰：「似此如之奈何！」回視玄德，談笑自若；卻見玄德背後一人，按劍而立，乃雲長也。孔明喜曰：「吾主無危矣。」遂不復入，仍回身至江邊等候。,"Now by chance Zhuge Liang came on shore and heard that his master had arrived and was with the Commander-in-Chief. The news gave Zhuge Liang a great shock, and he said to himself, ""What is to be done now?""He made his way to the reception tent and stole a look therein. He saw murder written on Zhou Yu's countenance and noted the assassins hidden within the walls of the tent. Then he got a look at Liu Bei, who was laughing and talking quite unconcernedly. But when he noticed the redoubtable figure of Guan Yu near his master's side, he became quite calm and contented.""My lord faces no danger,"" said Zhuge Liang, and he went away to the river bank to await the end of the interview."
周瑜與玄德飲宴，酒行數巡，瑜起身把盞，猛見雲長按劍立於玄德背後，忙問何人？玄德曰：「吾弟關雲長也。」瑜驚曰：「非向日斬顏良，文醜，者乎？」玄德曰：「然也。」瑜大驚，汗流浹背，便斟酒與雲長把盞。,"Meanwhile the banquet of welcome proceeded. After the wine had gone around several times, Zhou Yu picked up a cup to give the signal agreed upon. But at that moment Zhou Yu saw so fierce a look upon the face of the trusty henchman who stood, sword in hand, behind his guest, that Zhou Yu hesitated and hastily asked who he was.""That is my brother, Guan Yu,"" replied Liu Bei.Zhou Yu, quite startled, said, ""Is he the slayer of Yan Liang and Wen Chou?""""Exactly; he it is,"" replied Liu Bei.The sweat of fear broke out all over Zhou Yu's body and trickled down his back. Then he poured out a cup of wine and presented it to Guan Yu."
少頃，魯肅入。玄德曰：「孔明何在？煩子敬請來一會。」瑜曰：「且待破了曹操，與孔明相會未遲。」玄德不敢再言。雲長以目視玄德，玄德會意，即起身辭瑜曰：「備暫告別。即日破敵收功之後，專當叩賀。」瑜亦不留，送出轅門。,"Just then Lu Su came in, and Liu Bei said to him, ""Where is Zhuge Liang? I would trouble you to ask him to come.""""Wait till we have defeated Cao Cao,"" said Zhou Yu, ""then you shall see him.""Liu Bei dared not repeat his request, but Guan Yu gave him a meaningful look which Liu Bei understood and rose, saying, ""I would take leave now. I will come again to congratulate you when the enemy has been defeated and your success shall be complete.""Zhou Yu did not press him to remain, but escorted him to the great gates of the camp."
玄德別了周瑜，與雲長等來至江邊，只見孔明已在舟中。玄德大喜。孔明曰：「主公知今日之危乎？」玄德愕然曰：「不知也。」孔明曰：「若無雲長，主公幾為周瑜所害矣。」玄德方纔省悟，便請孔明同回樊口。孔明曰：「亮雖居虎口，安如泰山。今主公但收拾船隻軍馬候用，以十一月二十甲子日後為期，可令子龍駕小舟來南岸邊等候。切勿有誤。」,"Liu Bei left. When he reached the river bank, they found Zhuge Liang awaiting them in their boat.Liu Bei was exceedingly pleased, but Zhuge Liang said, ""Sir, do you know in how great danger you were today?""Suddenly sobered, Liu Bei said, ""No, I did not think of danger.""""If Guan Yu had not been there, you would have been killed,"" said Zhuge Liang.Liu Bei, after a moment's reflection, saw that it was true. He begged Zhuge Liang to return with him to Fankou, but Zhuge Liang refused.""I am quite safe,"" said Zhuge Liang. ""Although I am living in the tiger's mouth, I am as steady as the Taishan Mountains. Now, my lord, return and prepare your ships and soldiers. On the twentieth day of the eleventh month, send Zhao Zilong with a small ship to the south bank to wait for me. Be sure there is no miscarriage."""
玄德問其意。孔明曰：「但看東南風起，亮必還矣。」玄德再欲問時，孔明催促玄德作速開船。言訖自回。玄德與雲長及從人開船，行不數里，忽見上流頭放下五六十隻船來。船頭上一員大將，橫矛而立，乃張飛也。因恐玄德有失，雲長獨力難支，特來接應。於是三人一同回寨，不在話下。,"""What are your intentions?"" said Liu Bei.""When the southeast wind begins, I shall return.""Liu Bei would have questioned him further, but Zhuge Liang pressed him to go. So the boat started up river again, while Zhuge Liang returned to his temporary lodging.The boat had not proceeded far when appeared a small fleet of fifty ships sweeping down with the current, and in the prow of the leading vessel stood a tall figure armed with a spear. Guan Yu was ready to fight. But when they were near, they recognized that was Zhang Fei, who had come down fearing lest his brother might be in some difficulty from which the strong arm of Guan Yu might even be insufficient to rescue him.The three brothers thus returned together."
卻說周瑜送了玄德，回至寨中，魯肅入問曰：「公既誘玄德至此，為何又不下手？」瑜曰：「關雲長，世之虎將也，與玄德行坐相隨，吾若下手，他必來害我。」,"After Zhou Yu, having escorted Liu Bei to the gate of his camp, had returned to his quarters, Lu Su soon came to see him.""Then you had cajoled Liu Bei into coming, why did you not carry out your plan?"" asked Lu Su.""Because of that Guan Yu. He is a very tiger, and he never left his brother for a moment. If anything had been attempted, he would certainly have had my life."""
肅愕然。忽報曹操遣使送書至，瑜喚入。使者呈上書看時，封面上判云：「漢大丞相付周都督開拆。」瑜大怒，更不開看，將書扯碎，擲於地上，喝斬來使。肅曰：「兩國相爭，不斬來使。」瑜曰：「斬使以示威。」遂斬使者，將首級付從人持回。隨令甘寧為先鋒，韓當為左翼，蔣欽為右翼，瑜自部領諸將接應。來日四更造飯，五更開船，鳴鼓吶喊而進。,"Lu Su knew that Zhou Yu spoke the truth. Then suddenly they announced a messenger with a letter from Cao Cao. Zhou Yu ordered them to bring him in and took the letter. But when he saw the superscription The First Minister of Han to Commander-in-Chief Zhou Yu, he fell into a frenzy of rage, tore the letter to fragments, and threw them on the ground.""To death with this fellow!"" cried he.""When two countries are at war, their emissaries are not slain,"" said Lu Su.""Messengers are slain to show one's dignity and independence,"" replied Zhou Yu.The unhappy bearer of the letter was decapitated, and his head sent back to Cao Cao by the hands of his escort.Zhou Yu then decided to move. The van under Gan Ning was to advance, supported by two wings led by Han Dang and Jiang Qin. Zhou Yu would lead the center body in support. The next morning the early meal was eaten in the fourth watch, and the ships got under way in the fifth with a great beating of drums."
卻說曹操知周瑜毀書斬使，大怒，便喚蔡瑁，張允，等一班荊州降將為前部。操自為後軍，催督戰船，到三江口。早見東吳船隻，蔽江而來。為首一員大將，坐在船頭上大呼曰：「吾乃甘寧也！誰敢來與我決戰？」蔡瑁令弟蔡壎前進。兩船將近，甘寧拈弓搭箭，望蔡壎射來，應弦而倒。寧遂驅船大進，萬弩齊發，曹軍不能抵當。右邊蔣欽，左邊韓當，直衝入曹軍隊中。曹軍大半是青徐之兵，素不習水戰，大江面上，戰船一擺，早立腳不住。甘寧等三路戰船，縱橫水面。周瑜又催船助戰。曹軍中箭著砲者，不計其數。從巳時直殺到未時，周瑜雖得利，只恐寡不敵眾，遂下令鳴金收住船隻。,"Cao Cao was greatly angered when he heard that his letter had been torn to fragments, and he resolved to attack forthwith. His advance was led by the Supreme Admiral Cai Mao, the Vice-Admiral Zhang Yun, and others of the Jingzhou officers who had joined his side. Cao Cao went as hastily as possible to the meeting of the three rivers and saw the ships of the South Land sailing up.In the bow of the foremost ship from the south stood a fine figure of a warrior, who cried, ""I am Gan Ning. I challenge anyone to combat!""Cai Mao sent his young brother, Cai Xun, to accept the challenge. But as Cai Xun's ship approached, Gan Ning shot an arrow and Cai Xun fell. Gan Ning pressed forward, his crossbowmen keeping up a heavy discharge which Cao Cao's troops could not stand. The wings of Han Dang from the left and Jiang Qin from the right also joined in.Cao Cao's soldiers, being mostly from the dry plains of the north, did not know how to fight effectually on water, and the southern ships had the battle all their own way. The slaughter was very great. However, after a contest lasting till afternoon, Zhou Yu thought it more prudent, in view of the superior numbers of his enemy, not to risk further the advantage he had gained. So he beat the gongs as the signal to cease battle and recall the ships."
曹軍敗回，操登旱寨，再整軍士，喚蔡瑁，張允，責之曰：「東吳兵少，反為所敗，是汝等不用心耳！」蔡瑁曰：「荊州水軍，久不操練；青徐之軍，又素不習水戰；故爾致敗。今當先立水寨，令青徐軍在中，荊州軍在外，每日教習精熟，方可用之。」操曰：「汝既為水軍都督，可以便宜從事，何必稟我？」於是張，蔡，二人，自去訓練水軍。沿江一帶分二十四座水門，以大船居於外為城郭，小船居於內，可通往來。至晚點上燈火，照得天心水面通紅。旱寨三百餘里，煙火不絕。,"Cao Cao was worsted, but his ships returned to the bank, where a camp was made and order was restored.Cao Cao sent for his defeated leaders and reproached them, saying, ""You did not do your best. You let an inferior force overcome you.""Cai Mao defended himself, saying, ""The Jingzhou marines have not been exercised for a long time, and the others have never been trained for naval warfare at all. A naval camp must be instituted, the northern soldiers trained, and the Jingzhou force drilled. When they have been made efficient, they will win victories.""""You are the Supreme Admiral. If you know what should be done, why have you not done it?"" said Cao Cao. ""What is the use of telling me this?""So Cai Mao and Zhang Yun organized a naval camp on the river bank. They established twenty-four ""Water Gates,"" with the large ships outside as a sort of rampart, and under their protection the smaller ships went to and fro freely. At night when the lanterns and torches were lit, the very sky was illuminated, and the water shone red with the glare. On land the smoke of the camp fires could be traced for one hundred mile without a break."
卻說周瑜得勝回寨，犒賞三軍，一面差人到吳侯處報捷。當夜瑜登高觀望，只見西邊火光接天。左右告曰：「此皆北軍燈火之光也。」瑜亦心驚。,"Zhou Yu returned to camp and feasted his victorious fighting force. A messenger bore the joyful tidings of victory to his master Sun Quan. When night fell, Zhou Yu went up to the summit of one of the hills and looked out over the long line of bright lights stretching toward the west, showing the extent of the enemy's camp. He said nothing, but a great fear came in upon him."
次日，瑜欲親往探看曹軍水寨，乃命收拾樓船一隻，帶著鼓樂，隨行健將數員，各帶強弓硬弩，一齊上船迤邐前進。至操寨邊，瑜命下了釘石，樓船上鼓樂齊奏。瑜暗窺他水寨，大驚曰：「此深得水軍之妙也！」問：「水軍都督是誰？」左右曰：「蔡瑁，張允。」瑜思曰：「二人久居江東，諳習水戰，吾必設計先除此二人，然後可以破曹。」,"Next day Zhou Yu decided that he would go in person to find out the strength of the enemy. So he bade them prepare a small squadron which he manned with strong, hardy men armed with powerful bows and stiff crossbows. He also placed musicians on each ship. They set sail and started up the stream. When they got opposite Cao Cao's camp, the heavy stones that served as anchors were dropped, and the music was played while Zhou Yu scanned the enemy's naval camp. What he saw gave him no satisfaction, for everything was most admirable.He said, ""How well and correctly built is that naval base! Anyone knows the names of those in command?""""They are Cai Mao and Zhang Yun,"" said his officers.""They have lived in the south a long time,"" said Zhou Yu, ""and are thoroughly experienced in naval warfare. I must find some means of removing them before I can effect anything."""
正窺看間，早有曹軍飛報曹操，說周瑜偷看吾寨，操命縱船擒捉。瑜見水寨中旗號動，急教收起釘石，兩邊四下一齊輪轉櫓棹，望江面上如飛而去。比及曹寨中船出時，周瑜的樓船，已離了十數里遠，追之不及，回報曹操。,"Meanwhile on shore the sentinels had told Cao Cao that the enemy craft were spying upon them, and Cao Cao ordered out some ships to capture the spies. Zhou Yu saw the commotion of the commanding flags on shore and hastily gave the order to unmoor and sail down stream. The squadron at once got under way and scattered; to and fro went the oars, and each ship seemed to fly. Before Cao Cao's ships could get out after them, they were all far away.Cao Cao's ships took up the chase but soon saw pursuit was useless. They returned and reported their failure."
操問眾將曰：「昨日輸了一陣，挫動銳氣，今又被他深窺吾寨。吾當作何計破之？」言未畢，忽帳下一人出曰：「某自幼與周郎同窗交契，願憑三寸不爛之舌，往江東說此人來降。」曹操大喜，視之，乃九江人：姓蔣，名幹，字子翼，見為帳下幕賓。操問曰：「子翼與周公瑾相厚乎？」幹曰：「丞相放心。幹到江左，必要成功。」操問：「要將何物去？」幹曰：「只消一童隨往，二僕駕舟，其餘不用。」操甚喜，置酒與蔣幹送行。幹葛巾布袍，駕一隻小舟，逕到周瑜寨中，命傳報：「故人蔣幹相訪。」,"Again Cao Cao found fault with his officers and said, ""The other day you lost a battle, and the soldiers were greatly dispirited. Now the enemy have spied out our camp. What can be done?""In eager response to his question one stepped out, saying, ""When I was a youth, Zhou Yu and I were fellow students and pledged friends. My three-inch tongue is still good, and I will go over and persuade him to surrender.""Cao Cao, rejoiced to find so speedy a solution, looked at the speaker. It was Jiang Gan of Jiujiang, one of the counseling staff in the camp.""Are you a good friend of Zhou Yu?"" said Cao Cao.""Rest content, O Prime Minister,"" replied Jiang Gan. ""If I only get on the other side of the river, I shall succeed.""""What preparations are necessary?"" asked Cao Cao.""Just a youth as my servant and a couple of rowers. Nothing else.""Cao Cao offered him wine, wished him success, and sent him on his way.Clad in a simple linen robe and seated in his little craft, the messenger reached Zhou Yu's camp and bade the guards say that an old friend Jiang Gan wished to see him."
周瑜正在帳中議事，聞幹至，笑謂諸將曰：「說客至矣！」遂與眾將附耳低言：「如此如此。」眾皆應命而去。,"The commander was in his tent at a council when the message came, and he laughed as he said to those about him, ""A persuader is coming.""Then he whispered certain instructions in the ear of each one of them, and they went out to await his arrival.Zhou Yu received his friend in full ceremonial garb. A crowd of officers in rich silken robes were about him."
瑜整衣冠，引從者數百，皆錦衣花帽，前後簇擁而出。蔣幹引一青衣小童，昂然而來，瑜拜迎之。幹曰：「公瑾別來無恙！」瑜曰：「子翼良苦。遠涉江湖，為曹氏作說客耶？」幹愕然曰：「吾久別足下，特來敘舊，奈何疑我作說客也？」瑜笑曰：「吾雖不及師嚝之聰，聞絃歌而知雅意。」幹曰：「足下待故人如此，便請告退。」瑜笑而挽其臂曰：「吾但恐兄為曹氏作說客耳。既無此心，何速去也？」遂同入帳。敘禮畢，坐定，即傳令悉召江左英傑與子翼相見。,"The guest appeared, his sole attendant a lad dressed in a simple blue gown. Jiang Gan bore himself proudly as he advanced, and Zhou Yu made a low obeisance.""You have been well I hope since last we met,"" said Jiang Gan.""You have wandered far and suffered much in this task of emissary in Cao Cao's cause,"" said Zhou Yu.""I have not seen you for a very long time,"" said the envoy much taken aback, ""and I came to visit you for the sake of old times. Why do you call me an emissary for the Cao Cao's cause?""""Though I am not so profound a musician as Shi Kuang of old, yet I can comprehend the thought behind the music,"" replied Zhou Yu.""As you choose to treat your old friend like this, I think I will take my leave,"" said Jiang Gan.Zhou Yu laughed again, and taking Jiang Gan by the arm, said, ""Well, I feared you might be coming on his behalf to try to persuade me. But if this is not your intention, you need not go away so hastily.""So they two entered the tent. When they had exchanged salutes and were seated as friends, Zhou Yu bade them call his officers that he might introduce them."
須臾，文官武將，各穿錦衣；帳下偏裨將校，都披銀鎧；分兩行而入。瑜都教相見畢，就列於兩傍而坐，大張筵席，奏軍中得勝之樂，輪換行酒。瑜告眾官曰：「此吾同窗契友也，雖從江北到此，卻不是曹家說客；公等勿疑。」遂解佩劍付太史慈曰：「公可佩我劍作監酒。今日宴飲，但敘朋友交情；如有提起曹操與東吳軍旅之事者，即斬之！」,"They soon appeared civil and military officials, all dressed in their best. The military officers were clad in glittering silver armor and the staff looked very imposing as they stood ranged in two lines.The visitor was introduced to them all. Presently a banquet was spread, and while they feasted, the musicians played songs of victory and the wine circulated merrily.Under the mellowing influence, Zhou Yu's reserve seemed to thaw and he said, ""Jiang Gan is an old fellow student of mine, and we are pledged friends. Though he has arrived here from the north, he is no artful pleader so you need not be afraid of him.""Then Zhou Yu took off the commanding sword which he wore as Commander-in-Chief and handed it to Taishi Ci, saying, ""You take this and wear it for the day as master of the feast. This day we meet only as friends and speak only of friendship, and if anyone shall begin a discussion of the questions at issue between Cao Cao and the South Land, just slay him."""
太史慈應諾，按劍坐於席上。蔣幹驚愕，不敢多言。周瑜曰：「吾自領軍以來，滴酒不飲；今日見了故人，又無疑忌，當飲一醉。」說罷，大笑暢飲，座上觥籌交錯。飲至半酣，瑜攜幹手，同步出帳外。左右軍士，皆全裝貫帶，持戈執戟而立。瑜曰：「吾之軍士，頗雄壯否？」幹曰：「真熊虎之士也。」,"Taishi Ci took the sword and seated himself in his place. Jiang Gan was not a little overcome, but he said no word.Zhou Yu said, ""Since I assumed command, I have tasted no drop of wine; but today as an old friend is present and there is no reason to fear him, I am going to drink freely.""So saying he quaffed a huge goblet and laughed loudly.The rhinoceros cups went swiftly round from guest to guest till all were half drunk. Then Zhou Yu, laying hold of the guest's hand, led him outside the tent. The guards who stood around all braced themselves up and seized their shinning weapons.""Do you not think my soldiers a fine lot of fellows?"" said Zhou Yu.""Strong as bears and bold as tigers,"" replied Jiang Gan."
瑜又引幹到帳後一望，糧草堆積如山。瑜曰：「吾之糧草，頗足備否？」幹曰：「兵精糧足，名不虛傳。」瑜佯醉大笑曰：「想周瑜與子翼同學時，不曾望有今日。」幹曰：「以吾兄高才，實不為過。」瑜執幹手曰：「大丈夫處世，遇知己之主，外託君臣之義，內結骨肉之恩，言必行，計必從，禍福共之，假使蘇奏，張儀，陸賈，酈生，復出，口似懸河，舌如利刃，安能動我心哉！」,"Then Zhou Yu led him to the rear of the tent whence he saw the grain and forage piled up in mountainous heaps.""Do you not think I have a fairly good store of grain and forage?""""Your troops are brave and your supplies ample: The empire's gossip is not baseless, indeed.""Zhou Yu pretended to be quite intoxicated and went on, ""When you and I were students together, we never looked forward to a day like this, did we?""""For a genius like you, it is nothing extraordinary,"" said the guest.Zhou Yu again seized his hand, and they sat down.""A man of the time, I have found a proper lord to serve. In his service, we rely upon the right feeling between minister and prince outside, and at home we are firm in the kindly feeling of relatives. He listens to my words and follows my plans. We share the same good or evil fortune. Even when the great old persuaders like Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Lu Jia, and Li Yiji lived again, even when their words poured forth like a rushing river, their tongues were as a sharp sword, it is impossible to move such as I am!"""
言罷大笑。蔣幹面如土色。瑜復攜幹入帳，會諸將再飲；因指諸將曰：「此皆江東之英傑。今日此會，可名『群英會』。」飲至天晚，點上燈燭，瑜自起舞劍作歌。歌曰：丈夫處世兮立功名；立功名兮慰平生。慰平生兮吾將醉；吾將醉兮發狂吟！,"Zhou Yu burst into a loud laugh as he finished, and Jiang Gan's face had become clay-colored. Zhou Yu then led his guest back into the tent, and again they fell to drinking.Presently Zhou Yu pointed to the others at table and said, ""These are all the best and bravest of the land of the south.One might call this the 'Gathering of Heroes.'""They drank on till daylight failed and continued after lamps had been lit. Zhou Yu even gave an exhibition of sword play and sang this song:When a man is in the world, O,He ought to do his best.And when he's done his best, O.He ought to have his rest.And when I have my rest, O,I'll quaff my wine with zest.And when I'm drunk as drunk can be, O,I'll sing the madman's litany."
歌罷，滿座歡笑。至夜深，幹辭曰：「不勝酒力矣。」瑜命撤席，諸將辭出。瑜曰：「久不與子翼同榻，今宵抵足而眠。」於是佯作大醉之狀，攜幹入帳共寢。瑜和衣臥倒，嘔吐狼藉。蔣幹如何睡得著？伏枕聽時，軍中鼓打二更，起視殘燈尚明。看周瑜時，鼻息如雷。幹見帳內桌上，堆著一卷文書，乃起床偷視之，卻都是往來書信。內有一封，上寫「蔡瑁張允謹封」。幹大驚，暗讀之。書略曰：「某等降曹，非圖仕祿，迫於勢耳。今已賺北軍困於寨中，但得其便，即將操賊之首，獻於麾下。早晚人到，便有關報。幸勿見疑。先此敬覆。」,"A burst of applause greeted the song. By this time it was getting late, and the guest begged to be excused.""The wine is too much for me,"" said Jiang Gan.His host bade them clear the table.As all the others left, Zhou Yu said, ""It has been many a day since I shared a couch with my friend, but we will do so tonight.""Putting on the appearance of irresponsible intoxication, he led Jiang Gan into the tent and they went to bed. Zhou Yu simply fell, all dressed as he was, and lay there emitting uncouth grunts and groans, so that to the guest sleep was impossible.Jiang Gan lay and listened to the various camp noises without and his host's thunderous snores within. About the second watch he rose and looked at his friend by the dim light of the small lamp. He also saw on the table a heap of papers, and coming out and looking at them furtively, he saw they were letters. Among them he saw one marked as coming from Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, Cao Cao's Supreme Admiral and Vice-Admiral. He read it and this is what it said:""We surrendered to Cao Cao, not for the sake of pay but under stress of circumstances. Now we have been able to hold these northern soldiers into this naval camp but, as soon as occasion offers, we mean to have the rebel's head to offer as a sacrifice to your banner. From time to time there will be reports as occasions serve, but you may trust us. This is our humble reply to your letter."""
幹思曰：「原來蔡瑁，張允，結連東吳！……」遂將書暗藏於衣內。再欲檢看他書時，床上周瑜翻身，幹急滅燈就寢。瑜口內含糊曰：「子翼，我數日之內，教你看曹賊之首！」幹勉強應之。瑜又曰：「子翼，且住！……教你看曹賊之首！……」及幹問之，瑜又睡著。,"""Those two were connected with the South Land in the beginning,"" thought Jiang Gan, so he secreted the letter in his dress and began to examine the others. But at that moment Zhou Yu turned over, and so Jiang Gan hastily blew out the light and went to his couch.Zhou Yu was muttering as he lay there as if dreaming, saying, ""Friend, I am going to let you see Cao Cao's head in a day or two.""Jiang Gan hastily made some reply to load on his host to say more. Then came, ""Wait a few days; you will see Cao Cao's head. The old wretch!""Jiang Gan tried to question him as to what he meant, but Zhou Yu was fast asleep and seemed to hear nothing."
幹伏於床上，將近四更，只聽得有人入帳喚曰：「都督醒否？」周瑜夢中做忽覺之狀，故問那人曰：「床上睡著何人？」答曰：「都督請子翼同寢，何故忘卻？」瑜懊悔曰：「吾平日未嘗飲醉。昨日醉後失事，不知可曾說甚言語？」那人曰：「江北有人到此。」瑜喝：「低聲！」便喚：「子翼。」蔣幹只裝睡著。瑜潛出帳。幹竊聽之，只聞有人在外曰：「張蔡二都督道：『急切不得下手。』……」後面言語頗低，聽不真實。,"Jiang Gan lay there on his couch wide awake till the fourth watch was beating. Then someone came in, saying, ""General, are you awake?""At that moment as if suddenly awakened from the deepest slumber, Zhou Yu started up and said, ""Who is this on the couch?""The voice replied, ""Do you not remember, General? You asked your old friend to stay the night with you. It is he, of course.""""I drank too much last night,"" said Zhou Yu in a regretful tone, ""and I forgot. I seldom indulge to excess and am not used to it. Perhaps I said many things I ought not.""The voice went on, ""A man has arrived from the north.""""Speak lower,"" said Zhou Yu, and turning toward the sleeper, he called him by name. But Jiang Gan affected to be sound asleep and made no sign.Zhou Yu crept out of the tent, while Jiang Gan listened with all his ears. He heard the man say, ""Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, the two commanders, said that they cannot execute the plan in a hurry.""But listening as he did with straining ears, he could not make out what followed."
少頃，瑜入帳，又喚：「子翼。」蔣幹只是不應，蒙頭假睡。瑜亦解衣就寢。幹尋思：「周瑜是個精細人，天門尋書不見，必然害我。……」睡至五更，幹起喚周瑜，瑜卻睡著。幹戴上巾幘，潛步出帳，喚了小童，逕出轅門。軍士問：「先生那裏去？」幹曰：「吾在此恐誤都督事，權且告別。」軍士亦不阻當。,"Soon after Zhou Yu reentered and again called out his companion's name. But no reply came, for Jiang Gan was pretending to be in the deepest slumber and to hear nothing. Then Zhou Yu undressed and went to bed.As Jiang Gan lay awake, he remembered that Zhou Yu was known to be meticulously careful in affairs, and if in the morning Zhou Yu found that a letter had disappeared, he would certainly slay the offender. So Jiang Gan lay there till near daylight and then called out to his host. Getting no reply, he rose, dressed, and stole out of the tent. Then he called his servant and made for the camp gate.""Whither are you going, Sir?"" said the watchmen at the gate.""I fear I am in the way here,"" replied Jiang Gan, ""and so I have taken leave of the Commander-in-Chief for a time. So do not stop me."""
幹下船，飛棹回見曹操。操問：「子翼幹事若何？」幹曰：「周瑜雅量高致，非言詞所能動也。」操怒曰：「事又不濟，反為所笑！」幹曰：「雖不能說周瑜，卻與丞相打聽得一件事。乞退左右。」幹取出書信，將上項事逐一說與曹操。操大怒曰：「二賊如此無禮耶！」即便喚蔡瑁，張允，到帳下。操曰：「我欲使汝二人進兵。」瑁曰：「軍尚未曾練熟，不可輕進。」操怒曰：「軍若練熟，吾首級獻於周郎矣！」蔡，張二人不知其意，驚慌不能回答，操喝武士推出斬之。須臾，獻頭帳下，操方省悟曰：「吾中計矣！」後人有詩歎曰：曹操奸雄不可當，一時詭計中周郎。蔡張賣主求生計，誰料今朝劍下亡！,"He found his way to the river bank and reembarked. Then, with flying oars, he hastened back to Cao Cao's camp. When he arrived, Cao Cao asked at once how he had sped, and he had to acknowledge failure.""Zhou Yu is very clever and perfectly high-minded,"" said Jiang Gan.""Nothing that I could say moved him in the least.""""Your failure makes me look ridiculous,"" said Cao Cao.""Well, if I did not win over Zhou Yu, I found out something for you. Send away these people, and I will tell you,"" said Jiang Gan.The servants were dismissed, and then Jiang Gan produced the letter he had stolen from Zhou Yu's tent. He gave it to Cao Cao. Cao Cao was very angry and sent for Cai Mao and Zhang Yun at once.As soon as they appeared, he said, ""I want you two to attack.""Cai Mao replied, ""But the soldiers are not yet sufficiently trained.""""The soldiers will be well enough trained when you have sent my head to Zhou Yu, eh?""Both commanders were dumb-founded, having not the least idea what this meant. They remained silent for they had nothing to say. Cao Cao bade the executioners lead them away to instant death. In a short time their heads were produced.By this time Cao Cao had thought over the matter, and it dawned upon him that he had been tricked. A poem says:No one could stand against Cao Cao,Of sin he had full share,But Zhou Yu was more treacherous,And caught him in a snare.Two commanders to save their lives,Betrayed a former lord,Soon after, as was very met.Both fell beneath the sword."
眾將見殺了蔡，張二人，入問其故。操雖心知中計，卻不肯認錯，乃謂眾將曰：「二人怠慢軍法，吾故斬之。」眾皆嗟呀不已。操於眾將內選毛玠，于禁，為水軍都督，以代蔡，張二人之職。,"The death of these two naval commanders caused much consternation in the camp, and all their colleagues asked the reason for their sudden execution. Though Cao Cao knew they had been victimized, he would not acknowledge it.So he said, ""These two had been remiss, and so had been put to death.""The others were aghast, but nothing could be done. Two other officers, Mao Jie and Yu Jin, were put in command of the naval camp."
細作探知，報過江東。周瑜大喜曰：「吾所患者，此二人耳。今既剿除，吾無憂矣。」肅曰：「都督用兵如此，何愁曹賊不破乎！」瑜曰：「吾料諸將不知此計，獨有諸葛亮識見勝我，想此謀亦不能瞞也。子敬試以言挑之，看他知也不知，便當回報。」正是：還將反間成功事，去試從旁冷眼人。未知肅去問孔明還是如何，且看下文分解。,"Spies took the news to Zhou Yu, who was delighted at the success of his ruse.""Those two Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were my only source of anxiety,"" said he. ""Now they are gone: I am quite happy.""Lu Su said, ""General, if you can continue like this, you need not fear Cao Cao.""""I do not think any of them saw my game,"" said Zhou Yu, ""except Zhuge Liang. He beats me, and I do not think this ruse was hidden from him. You go and sound him. See if he knew.""Zhou Yu's treacherous plot succeeded well,Dissension sown, his rivals fell.Drunk with success was he, but soughtTo know what cynic Zhuge Liang thought.What passed between Lu Su and Zhuge Liang will next be related."
