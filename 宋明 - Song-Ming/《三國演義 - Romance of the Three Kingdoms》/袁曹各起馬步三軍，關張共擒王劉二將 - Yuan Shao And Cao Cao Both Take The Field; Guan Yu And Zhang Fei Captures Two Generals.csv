卻說陳登獻計於玄德曰：「曹操所懼者袁紹。紹虎踞冀、青、幽、并諸郡，帶甲百萬，文官武將極多，今何不寫書遣人到彼求救？」玄德曰：「紹向與我未通往來，今又新破其弟，安肯相助？」登曰：「此間有一人與袁紹三世通家。若得其一書致紹，紹必來相助。」玄德問何人。登曰：「此人乃公平日所折節敬禮者，何故忘之？」玄德猛省曰：「莫非鄭康成先生？」登笑曰：「然也。」,"This was the plan Chen Deng proposed to Liu Bei, ""Yuan Shao is Cao Cao's terror. He is strongly posted in an extensive territory of four regions —-Jizhou, Qingzhou, Youzhou, and Bingzhou —-with one million fighting soldiers and numerous able officers. Write letters and pray him rescue you.""Liu Bei replied, ""But we have never had any dealings with each other, and he is unlikely to do such a thing for a person who has just destroyed his brother.""""There is someone here whose family have been on intimate terms with the Yuans for a hundred years. Yuan Shao would surely come, if he wrote.""""And who is this?""""A man you know well and respect greatly. Can you not guess?""""You surely mean Zheng Xuan,"" said Liu Bei suddenly.""That is he,"" said Chen Deng smiling."
原來鄭康成名玄，好學多才，嘗受業於馬融。融每當講學，必設絳帳，前聚生徒，後陳聲妓，侍女環列左右。玄聽講三年，目不邪視，融甚奇之。及學成而歸，融歎曰：「得我學之秘，惟鄭玄一人耳！」玄家中侍婢俱通毛詩。一婢嘗忤玄意，玄命長跪階前。一婢戲謂之曰：「『胡為乎泥中？』」此婢應聲曰：「『薄言往愬，逢彼之怒。』」其風雅如此。桓帝朝，玄官至尚書。後因十常侍之亂，棄官歸田，居於徐州。玄德在涿郡時，已曾師事之。及為徐州牧，時時造廬請教，敬禮特甚。,"Now Zheng Xuan was a student and a man of great talent, who had long studied under the famed teacher Ma Rong, whose knowledge of the Book of Odes was universally recognized. Whenever Ma Rong lectured, he let fall a curtain behind which were a circle of singing girls. The students were assembled in front of this curtain. Zheng Xuan attended these lectures for three years and never once let his eyes wander to the curtain.Naturally the master admired his pupil. After Zheng Xuan had finished his studies and gone home, Ma Rong praised him to the others, saying, ""Only one man has penetrated the inner meaning of my instructions, and that one is Zheng Xuan.""In Zheng Xuan's household, the waiting maids were familiar with the Book of Odes. Once one of the maids opposed Zheng Xuan's wishes, so as punishment she was made to kneel in front of the steps. Another girl made fun of her, quoting from an ode:""What are you doing there in the mire?""The kneeling girl capped the verse from another ode, quoted she:""That was but a simple word I said,Yet brought it wrath upon my head.""Such was the family in which Zheng Xuan had been born. In the reign of the Emperor Huan, he rose to the rank of Chair of the Secretariat. But when the Ten Eunuchs began to control the government, he gave up office and retired into the country to Xuzhou. Liu Bei had known him before, had consulted him on many occasions, and greatly respected him."
當下玄德想出此人，大喜，便同陳登親至鄭玄家中，求其作書。玄慨然依允，寫書一封，付與玄德。玄德便差孫乾星夜齎往袁紹處投遞。紹覽畢，自忖曰：「玄德攻滅吾弟，本不當相助；但重以鄭尚書之命，不得不往救之。」遂聚文武官，商議興兵伐曹操。,"Liu Bei was glad that he had remembered this man, and without loss of time, in company with Chen Deng, he went to Zheng Xuan's house to ask him to draft this letter, which Zheng Xuan generously consented to do.Sun Qian was entrusted with the task of delivery and set out at once. Yuan Shao read it and considered the matter long before speaking.""Liu Bei destroyed my brother, and I ought not to help him, but out of consideration for the writer of this letter I must.""Thereupon Yuan Shao assembled his officers to consider an attack upon Cao Cao."
謀士田豐曰：「兵起連年，百姓疲弊，倉廩無積，不可復興大軍。宜先遣人獻捷天子，若不得通，乃表稱曹操隔我王路，然後提兵屯黎陽；更於河內增益舟楫，繕置軍器，分遣精兵，屯劄邊鄙。三年之中，大事可定也。」謀士審配曰：「不然：以明公之神武，撫河朔之強盛，興兵討曹賊，易如反掌，何必遷延日月？」謀士沮授曰：「制勝之策，不在強盛。曹操法令既行，士迕精練，比公孫瓚坐受困者不同。今棄獻捷良策，而興無名之兵，竊為明公不取。」謀士郭圖曰：「非也：兵加曹操，豈曰無名？公正當及時早定大業。願從鄭尚書之言，與劉備共仗大義，剿滅曹賊；上合天意，下合民情，實為萬幸甚！」,"Adviser Tian Feng said, ""Do not raise an army. The people are worn out, and the granaries are empty with these constant wars. Let us rather report the recent victory of Gongsun Zan to the Throne. If that does not reach the Emperor, then memorialize that Cao Cao is hindering the government. Then raise an army, occupy Liyang, assemble a Yellow River fleet in Henan, prepare weapons, send out your various divisions, and within three years you will win all round.""Adviser Shen Pei replied, ""I do not agree. The military genius of our illustrious lord having overcome the hordes of the north, to dispose of Cao Cao is as simple as turning one's hand. It is not a matter of months.""Adviser Ju Shou said, ""Victory is not always to the many. Cao Cao's discipline is excellent; his soldiers are brave and well drilled. He will not sit down quietly waiting to be surrounded as Gongsun Zan did. Now you abandon the intention to inform the Throne of our success, which I find a good plan, but you intend to send out an army without any valid excuse. Our lord should not do that.""Then followed adviser Guo Tu, saying, ""You are wrong. No expedition against Cao Cao can lack excuse. But if our master would take the chance now offering itself of coming into his own, he will accede to the request in the letter of Zheng Xuan and ally himself with Liu Bei for the destruction of Cao Cao. This would win the approval of Heaven and the affections of the people, a double blessing."""
四人爭論未定，紹躊躇不決。忽許攸、荀諶自外而入。紹曰：「二人多有見識，且看如何主張。」二人施禮畢，紹曰：「鄭尚書有書來，令我起兵助劉備，攻曹操。起兵是乎？不起兵是乎？」二人齊聲應曰：「明公以眾克寡，以強攻弱，討漢賊以扶王室：起兵是心。」紹曰：「二人所見，正合我心。」便商議興兵。先令孫乾回報鄭玄，並約玄德準備接應；一面令審配、逢紀為統軍，田豐、荀諶、許攸為謀士，顏良、文醜為將軍，起馬軍一十五萬，步兵一十五萬，共精兵三十萬，望黎陽進發。,"Thus the four advisers differed and wrangled, and Yuan Shao could not decide which to follow.Then there came two others, Xu You and Xun Shen, and, seeing them, Yuan Shao said, ""You two have wide experience, how would you decide?""The two made their obeisance, and Yuan Shao said, ""A letter from Zheng Xuan the Chair has arrived, counseling me to support Liu Bei in an attack on Cao Cao. Now am I to send an army or not send an army?""They both cried with one voice, ""Send! Your armies are numerous enough and strong enough. You will destroy a traitor and help the dynasty.""""Your words just express my desire,"" said Yuan Shao and thenceforward the discussion turned on the expedition.First, Liu Bei's legate, Sun Qian, was sent back with Yuan Shao's consent and instructions for Liu Bei to make ready to cooperate. Second, Yuan Shao assigned Shen Pei and Peng Ji as Commanding Generals; Tian Feng, Xun Shen, and Xu You as Military Advisers; Yan Liang and Wen Chou as Generals. The army was to be composed of three hundred thousand, horse and foot in equal numbers. They were to march on Liyang."
分撥已定，郭圖進曰：「以明公大舉伐操，必須數操之惡，馳檄各郡，聲罪致討，然後名正言順。」紹從之，遂令書記陳琳草檄。琳字孔璋，素有才名；靈帝時為主簿。因諫何進不聽，復遭董卓之亂，避難冀州，紹用為記室。當下令草檄，援筆立就。其文曰：,"When the arrangements were complete, Guo Tu went to his chief, saying, ""In order to manifest the righteousness of your attack on Cao Cao, it would be well to issue a manifesto with a summary of his various crimes.""Yuan Shao approved of this, and Chen Lin, well known as a scholar, was entrusted to compose such a document. Chen Lin had been the Court Secretary in the reign of the late Emperor Ling. When Dong Zhuo unseated Regent Marshal He Jin, Chen Lin sought safety in Jizhou. This is the manifesto:"
蓋聞明主圖危以制變，忠臣慮難以立權。是以有非常之人，然後有非常之事；有非常之事，然後立非常之功。夫非常者，固非常人所擬也。,"""A perspicacious ruler wisely provides against political vicissitudes; a loyal minister carefully foresees the difficulties in the assertion of authority. Wherefore a person of unusual parts precedes an extraordinary situation, and of such a person the achievements will be extraordinary. For indeed the ordinary person is quite unequal to an extraordinary situation."
曩者，強秦弱主，趙高執柄，專制朝權，威福由己；時人迫脅，莫敢正言；終有望夷之敗，祖宗焚減，汙辱至今，永為世鑒。及臻呂后季年，產，祿專政，內兼二軍，外統梁趙；擅斷萬機，決事省禁；下陵上替，海內寒心。於是絳侯、朱虛興威奮怒，誅夷逆暴，尊立太奈；故能王道興隆，光明顯融：此則大臣立權之明表也。,"""In former days, after having gained ascendancy over a weakling emperor of the powerful Qin Dynasty, Prime Minister Zhao Gao wielded the whole authority of the Throne, overruling the government. All dignity and fortune came through him, and his contemporaries were restrained so that none dared to speak openly. Slowly but surely evolved the tragedy of the Wangyi Palace, when the Emperor was slain and the Imperial Tablets perished in the flames. Zhao Gao, the author of these crimes, has ever since been held up to obloquy as the arch example of an evil doer.""In the later days of Empress Lu of the Hans, after the death of the Supreme Ancestor, the world saw Lu Chan and Lu Lu, brothers of the Empress and fellows in wickedness, monopolizing the powers of government. Within the capital, they commanded two armies, and without they ruled the feudal states of Liang and Zhao. They arbitrarily controlled all state affairs and decided all questions in the council chamber and the court. This dominance of the base and declension of the noble continued till the hearts of the people grew cold within them.""Thereupon Zhou Bo, Lord of Jiang, and Liu Zhan, Lord of Zhuxu, asserted their dignity and let loose their wrath. They destroyed the contumacious ministers and restored their ruler to his royal state. Thus they enabled the kingly way to be reestablished and the glory to be manifested. Here are two instances where ministers asserted their authority."
司空曹操：祖父中常侍騰，與左悺、徐璜並作妖孽，饕餮放橫，傷化虐民。父嵩乞丐，攜養，因贓假位；輿金輦璧，輸貨權門；竊盜鼎司，傾覆重器。操閹遺醜，本無懿德；僄狡鋒俠，好亂樂禍。,"""This Cao Cao, now Minister of Works, forsooth, had for ancestor a certain eunuch named Cao Teng, fitting companion of Xu Huan and Zuo Guan. All three were prodigies of wickedness and insatiably avaricious and, let loose on the world, they hindered ethical progress and preyed upon the populace. This Cao Teng begged for and adopted Cao Cao's father who, by wholesale bribery, wagons of gold and cartloads of jewels presented at the gates of the influential, contrived to sneak his way into considerable office where he could subvert authority. Thus Cao Cao is the depraved bantling of a monstrous excrescence, devoid of all virtue in himself, ferocious and cunning, delighting in disorder and reveling in public calamity."
慕府董統鷹揚，掃除兇逆。續遇董卓，侵官暴民，於是提劍揮鼓，發命東夏，收羅英雄，棄瑕取用。故遂與操同諮合謀，授以裨師；謂其鷹犬之才，爪牙可任。至乃愚佻短略，輕進易退；傷夷折衂，數喪師徒。幕府輒復分兵命銳，修完補輯，表行東郡領袞州刺史，被以虎文，獎成威柄，冀獲秦師一剋之報。而操遂承資跋扈，恣行凶忒，割剝元元，殘賢害善。,"""Now I, Yuan Shao, a man of war, have mustered my armies and displayed my might that I may sweep away and destroy the evil opponents of government. I have already had to deal with Dong Zhuo, the ruffian who invaded the official circle and wrested the government. At that time I grasped my sword and beat the drums to restore order in the east. I assembled warriors, selected the best, and took them into my service. In this matter I came into relations with this Cao Cao and conferred with him to further my scheme. I gave him command of a subordinate force and looked to him to render such petty service as he was equal to. I suffered his stupidities and condoned his shortcomings, his rash attacks and facile retreats, his losses and shameful defeats, his repeated destruction of whole armies. Again and again I sent him more troops and filled the gaps in his depleted ranks. I even addressed a memorial to the Throne for him to be appointed Imperial Protector of Yanzhou. I made him feel as he were a tiger. I added to his honors and increased his authority, hoping that eventually he would justify himself by a victory against Dong Zhuo such as Qin used Meng Ming against Jin. But Cao Cao availed himself of the opportunity to overstep all bounds, to give free rein to violence and evil. He stripped the common people, outraged the good, and injured the virtuous."
故九江太守邊讓：英才俊偉，天下知名；直言正色，論不阿諂；身首被梟懸之誅，妻拏受灰滅之。自是士林憤痛，民怨彌重；一夫奮臂，舉州同聲。故躬破於徐方，地奪於呂布；彷徨東裔，蹈據無所。幕府惟強幹弱枝之義，且不登叛人之黨，故復援旌擐甲，席捲起征。金鼓響振，布眾奔沮。拯其死亡之患，復其方伯之位。則幕府無德於兗土之民，而大有造於操也。,"""Bian Rang, Governor of Jiujiang, was a man of conspicuous talent and of world-wide reputation. He was honest in speech and correct in demeanor. He spoke without flattery. Cao Cao put him to death and his head was exposed, and his family utterly destroyed. From that day to this scholars have deeply mourned, and popular resentment has steadily grown. One person raised his arm in anger, and the whole countryside followed him. Whereupon Cao Cao was smitten at Xuzhou, and his territory was snatched by Lu Bu. He fled eastward without shelter or refuge.""My policy is a strong trunk and weak branches, a commanding central government and obedient feudal lords. Also I am no partisan. Therefore I again raised my banners, donned my armor, and moved forward to attack. My drums rolled for an assault on Lu Bu, and his multitudes incontinently fled. I saved Cao Cao from destruction and restored him to a position of authority. Wherein I must confess to showing no kindness to the people of Yanzhou, although it was a great matter for Cao Cao."
後會鑾駕返旆，群賊亂政。時冀州方有北鄙之警，匪遑離局；故使從事中郎徐勛，就發遣操，使繕修郊廟，翊衛幼主。操便放志：專行脅遷，當御省禁；卑侮王室，敗法亂紀；坐領三臺，專制朝政；爵賞由心，刑戮在口；所愛光五宗，所惡滅三族，群談者受顯誅，腹議者蒙隱戮；百僚鉗口，道路以目；尚書記朝會，公卿充員品而已。,"""Later it happened that the imperial cortege moved east, and a horde of rebels of Dong Zhuo's faction rose and attacked. The course of government was hindered. At that moment my territory was threatened from the north, and I could not leave it. Wherefore I sent one of my officers, Xu Xun, to Cao Cao to see to the repair of the dynastic temples and the protection of the youthful sovereign. Thereupon Cao Cao gave the rein to his inclinations. He arbitrarily ordered the removal of the court to Xuchang. He brought shame upon the Ruling House and subverted the laws. He engrossed the chairmanship of the three highest offices and monopolized the control of the administration. Offices and rewards were conferred according to his will; punishment was at his word. He glorified whole families of those he loved; he exterminated whole clans of those he hated. Open critics were executed; secret opponents were assassinated. Officials locked their lips; wayfarers only exchanged glances. Chairs of boards recorded levies, and every government official held a sinecure."
故太尉楊彪：典歷二司，享國極位。操因緣睚眥，被以非罪；榜楚參并，五毒備至；觸情任忒，不顧憲綱。又議郎趙彥：忠諫直言，義有可納，是以聖朝含聽，改容加錫。操欲迷奪時權，杜絕言路，擅收立殺，不俟報聞。又梁孝王先帝母昆，墳陵尊顯；桑梓松柏，猶宜肅恭；而操帥將校吏士，親臨發掘，破棺裸屍，掠取金寶。至今聖朝流涕，士民傷懷！,"""The late Yang Biao, a man who had filled two of the highest offices of state as Chairs of two boards, because of some petty grudge was, though guiltless, charged with a crime. He was beaten and suffered every form of cruelty. This arbitrary and impulsive act was a flagrant disregard of constitutional rules.""Another victim was the Counselor Zhao Yan. He was faithful in remonstrance, honest in speech, endowed with the highest principles of rectitude. He was listened to at court. His words carried enough weight with the Emperor to cause him to modify his intention and confer reward for outspokenness. Desirous of diverting all power into his own hands and stifle all criticism, Cao Cao presumed to arrest and put to death this censor, in defiance of all legal procedures.""Another evil deed was the destruction of the tomb of Prince Xiao of Liang, the brother of the late Emperor. His tomb should certainly have been respected, even its mulberries and sweetgum trees, its cypresses and its pines. Cao Cao led soldiers to the cemetery and stood by while it was desecrated, the coffin destroyed and the poor corpse exposed. They stole the gold and jewels of the dead. This deed brought tears to the eyes of the Emperor and rent the hearts of all people."
操又特置發丘中郎將，摸金校尉，所過隳突，無骸不露。身處三公之位，而行盜賊之態，污國害民，毒施人鬼！加其細政慘苛，科防互設；罾繳充蹊，坑阱塞路；舉手挂網羅，動足觸機陷：是以袞、豫有無聊之民，帝都有吁嗟之怨。歷觀載籍，無道之臣，貪殘酷烈，於操為甚！,"""Cao Cao also appointed new offices —-Commander Who Opens Grave Mounds and General Who Seeks for Gold —-whose tracks were marked by desecrated graves and exhumed bodies. Indeed, while assuming the position of the highest officer of state, he indulged the inclination of a bandit, polluting the empire, oppressing the people, a bane to gods and humans.""He added to this by setting up minute and vexatious prohibitions so that there were nets and snares spread in every pathway, traps and pitfalls laid in every road. A hand raised was caught in a net, a foot advanced was taken in an entanglement. Wherefore the people of his regions, Yanzhou and Yuzhou, waxed desperate and the inhabitants of the metropolis groaned and murmured in anger.""Read down the names through all the years,Of ministers that all people curse,For greed and cruelty and lust,Than Cao Cao you will not find a worse."
幕府方詰外姦，未及整訓；加緒含容，冀可彌縫。而操豺狼野心，潛包禍謀，乃欲摧撓棟梁，孤弱漢室；除滅忠正，專為梟雄。往者伐鼓北征公孫瓚，強寇桀逆，拒圍一年。操因其未破，陰交書命，外助王師，內相掩襲。會其行人發露，瓚亦梟夷，故使鋒芒挫縮，厥圖不果。,"""I have investigated the cases of evil deeds in the regions, but I have been unable to reform him. I have given him repeated opportunities hoping that he would repent. But he has the heart of a wolf, the nature of a wild beast. He nourishes evil in his bosom and desires to pull down the pillars of the state, to weaken the House of Han, to destroy the loyal and true, and to stand himself conspicuous as the chiefest of criminals.""Formerly, when I attacked the north, Gongsun Zan, that obstinate bandit and perverse brave, resisted my might for a year. Before Gongsun Zan could be destroyed, this Cao Cao wrote to him that, under the pretense of assisting my loyal armies, he would covertly lead them to destruction. The plot was discovered through his messengers, and Gongsun Zan also perished. This blunted Cao Cao's ardor, and his plans failed."
今乃屯據敖倉，阻河為固，欲以螳螂之斧，御隆車之隧。幕府奉漢威靈，折衝宇宙；長戟百萬，驍騎千群；奮中黃、育獲之士，騁良弓勁弩之勢；并州越太行，青州涉濟漯；大軍汎黃河以角其前，荊州下宛葉而犄其後；雷震虎步，並急虜廷，若舉炎火以炳飛蓬，覆滄海以沃熛炭，有何不滅者哉？又操軍吏士，其可戰者，皆出自幽、冀，或故營部曲，咸怨曠思歸，流涕北顧。其餘袞、豫之民，乃呂布、張楊之餘眾，覆亡迫脅，權時苟從；各被創夷，人為讎敵。若回旆反徂，登高崗而擊鼓吹，揚素揮以啟降路，必土崩瓦解，不俟血刃。方今漢室陵遲，綱維弛絕；聖朝無一介之輔，股肱無折衝之勢；方畿之內，簡練之臣，皆垂頭搨翼，莫所憑恃；雖有忠義之佐，脅於暴虐之臣，焉能展其節？又操持部曲精兵七百，圍守宮闕，外託宿衛，內實拘執，懼其篡逆之萌，因斯而作。此乃忠臣肝腦塗地之秋，烈士立功之會，可不勗哉？,"""Now he is camped at the Ao Granaries, with the Yellow River to strengthen his position. Like the mantis in the story, who threatened the chariot with its forelegs, he thinks himself terrible. But with the dignity and prestige of Han to support me, I confront the whole world. I have spearmen by millions, horsemen by hundreds of thousands, fierce and vigorous warriors strong as Chong Huang and Wu Huo, those heroes of antiquity. I have enlisted expert archers and strong bowmen. In Bingzhou my armies have crossed the Taihang Range, and in Qingzhou they have forded River Ji and River Ta. They have coasted down the Yellow River to attack his van, and from Jingzhou the armies of Liu Biao have descended to Wancheng and Wangye to smite his rearguard. Thunder-like in the weight of their march, tiger-like in the alertness of their advance, they are as flames let loose among light grass, as the blue ocean poured on glowing embers. Is there any hope that he escape destruction?""Of the hordes of Cao Cao, those who can fight are from the north or from other camps, and they all desire to return home. They weep whenever they look to the north. The others belong to Yanzhou or Yuzhou, being remnants of the armies of Lu Bu and Zhang Yang. Beaten, stern necessity forced them to accept service, but they take it only as a temporary expedient. They who have been wounded hate each other. If I give the signal to return and send my drums to the mountain tops, and wave the white flag to show them they may surrender, they will melt away like dew before the sun, and no blood will be shed. The victory will be mine.""Now the Hans are failing and the bonds of empire are relaxed. The sacred dynasty has no supporter, the ministers are not strong enough to cope with the difficulties. Within the capital the responsible ministers are crestfallen and helpless. There is no one to rely upon. Such loyal and high principled people as are left are browbeaten by a tyrannical minister. How can they manifest their virtue?""Cao Cao has surrounded the Palace with seven hundred veterans, the ostensible object being to guard the Emperor, but the covert design being to hold him prisoner. I fear this is but the first step in usurpation, and so I take my part. Now is the time for loyal ministers to sacrifice their lives, the opportunity for officers to perform meritorious deeds. Can I fail to urge you?"
操又矯命稱制，遣使發兵。恐邊遠州，郡過聽給與，違眾旅叛，舉以喪名，為天下笑，則明哲不取也。即日幽、并、青、冀四州並進。書到荊州，便勒見兵，與建忠軍協同聲勢。州郡各整義兵，羅落境界，舉武揚威，並匡社稷，則非常之功於是乎著。,"""Cao Cao has forged commands to himself to undertake the control of government affairs and, in the name of the state, sends out calls for military assistance. I fear lest distant regions may obey his behest and send troops to help him, to the detriment of the multitude and their everlasting shame. No wise person will do so.""The forces of four regions —-Bingzhou, Jizhou, Qingzhou, and Youzhou —-are moving out simultaneously. When this call reaches Jingzhou, you will see their forces cooperate with those of Liu Biao. All regions and counties ought to organize volunteers and set them along their borders to demonstrate their force and prove their loyal support of the dynasty. Will not this be rendering extraordinary service?"
其得操首者，封五千戶侯，賞錢五千萬。部曲偏裨將校諸吏降者，勿有所問。廣宣恩信，班揚符賞，布告天下，咸使知聖朝有拘迫之難。如律令。,"""The rank of lordship, with feudal rights over five thousand households and a money reward of five millions, will be the reward of the one who brings the head of Cao Cao.

紹覽檄大喜，即命使將此檄遍行州郡，並於各處關津隘口張挂。檄文傳至許都，時曹操方患頭風，臥病在床。左右將此檄傳進，操見之，毛骨悚然，出了一身冷汗，不覺頭風頓愈，從床上一躍而起，顧謂曹洪曰：「此檄何人所作？」洪曰：「聞是陳琳之筆。」操笑曰：「有文事者，必須以武略濟之。陳琳文事雖佳，其如袁紹武略之不足何！」遂聚眾謀士商議迎敵。,"Yuan Shao read this effusion with great joy. He at once ordered copies to be posted everywhere, in towns and cities, at gates, tax stations, ferries, and passes. Copies found their way to the capital, and one got into Cao Cao's palace. That day he happened to be in bed with a bad headache. The servants took the paper to the sick man's room. He read it and was frightened from the tips of his hair to the marrow of his very bones. He broke out into a cold perspiration, and his headache vanished.Cao Cao bounded out of bed and said to Cao Hong, ""Who wrote this?""""They say it is Chen Lin's brush,"" replied he.Cao Cao laughed, ""They have the literary gift; they would rather have the military too to back it up. This fellow may be a very elegant writer, but what if Yuan Shao's fighting capacity falls short?""Cao Cao called his advisers together to consider the next move."
孔融聞之，來見操曰：「袁紹勢大，不可與戰，只可與和。」荀彧曰：「袁紹無用之人，何必議和？」融曰：「袁紹土廣民強。其部下如許攸，郭圖，審配，逢紀，皆智謀之士；田豐，沮授，皆忠臣也；顏良，文醜，勇冠三軍；其餘高覽，張郃，淳于瓊，等俱世之名將，──何謂紹為無用之人乎？」彧笑曰：「紹兵多而不整；田豐剛而犯上，許攸貪而不智，審配專而無謀，逢紀果而無用，此四人者，勢不相容，必生內變。顏良，文醜，匹夫之勇，一戰可擒。其餘碌碌等輩，縱有百萬，何足道哉！」,"Kong Rong heard of the summons and went to Cao Cao, saying, ""You should not fight with Yuan Shao: He is too strong. Make peace.""Xun Yu said, ""He is despicable. Do not make peace.""Kong Rong replied, ""His land is wide and his people strong. He has many skillful strategists like Guo Tu, Xu You, Peng Ji, and Shen Pei; loyal leaders like Tian Feng and Ju Shou; and formidable generals like Yan Liang and Wen Chou; able commanders like Gao Lan, Zhang He, Han Meng, and Chunyu Qiong. You cannot say he is despicable.""Xun Yu laughed, saying, ""His army is a rabble. One general, Tian Feng, is bold but treacherous; another, Xu You, is greedy and ignorant; Shen Pei is devoted but stupid; Peng Ji is steady but useless. And these four of such different temperaments, mutually incompatible, will make for confusion rather than efficiency. The brave Yan Liang and Wen Chou are worthless and can be disposed of in the first battle; and the others such as Gao Lan, Zhang He, Han Meng, and Chunyu Qiong are poor, rough stuff. What is the use even of their hundred thousands?"""
孔融默然。操大笑曰：「皆不出荀文若之料。」遂喚前軍劉岱、後軍王忠引軍五萬，打著丞相旗號，去徐州攻劉備。原來劉岱舊為袞州刺史；及操取袞州，岱降於操，操用為偏將，故今差他與王忠一同領兵。操卻自引大軍二十萬，進黎陽，拒袁紹。程昱曰：「恐劉岱、王忠不稱其使。」操曰：「吾亦知非劉備敵手，權且虛張聲勢。」分付：「不可輕進。待我破紹，再勒兵破備。」劉岱、王忠領兵去了。曹操自引兵至黎陽。兩軍隔八十里，各自深溝高壘，相持不戰。自八月守至十月。原來許攸不樂審配領兵，沮授又恨紹不用其謀，各不相和，不圖進取。袁紹心懷疑惑，不思進兵。操乃喚呂布手下降將臧霸把守青、徐；于禁、李典屯兵河上；曹仁總督大軍，屯於官渡。操自引一軍，竟回許都。,"Kong Rong was silent, and Cao Cao smiled.""They are even as Xun Yu describes,"" said Cao Cao.Then Cao Cao issued orders. Generals Liu Dai and Wang Zhong were to lead an army of fifty thousand troops, displaying the Prime Minister's banners, and march against Xuzhou to attack Liu Bei.This Liu Dai had been Imperial Protector of Yanzhou but had surrendered to Cao Cao and entered Cao Cao's service after the fall of his region. Cao Cao had given him a rank as Supernumerary Leader and now was disposed to make use of him.Cao Cao himself took command of a large army of two hundred thousand troops for a simultaneous attack on Yuan Shao at Liyang.Adviser Cheng Yu said, ""The two Liu Dai and Wang Zhong sent against Liu Bei are unequal to their task.""""I know,"" said Cao Cao. ""They are not meant to fight Liu Bei. It is merely a feint. They have orders not to make any real attack till I have overcome Yuan Shao. Then Liu Bei will be next.""Liu Dai and Wang Zhong went their way, and Cao Cao marched out his grand army, which came into touch with the enemy, then thirty miles distant, at Liyang. Both sides made fortified camps and waited watching each other. This went on for two months of the autumn.There was dissension in Yuan Shao's camp. Xu You was at enmity with his colleague, Shen Pei, who was in commanding position; and the strategist Ju Shou resented the rejection of his plan. So they would not attack. Yuan Shao also could not make up his mind.Tired of this state of inaction, Cao Cao then gave orders to his commanders: Zang Ba was to continue the pressure on Qingzhou and Xuzhou; Yu Jin and Li Dian to deploy troops along the Yellow River; Cao Ren to quarter the main force at Guandu. Then Cao Cao with an army marched back to Capital Xuchang."
且說劉岱、王忠引軍五萬離徐州一百里下寨。中軍虛打曹丞相旗號，未敢進兵，只打聽河北消息。這裏玄德也不知曹操虛實，未敢擅動，亦只探聽河北。忽曹操差人催劉岱、王忠進戰。二人在寨中商議。岱曰：「丞相催促攻城，你可先去。」王忠曰：「丞相先差你。」岱曰：「我是主將，如何先去？」忠曰：「我和你同引兵去。」岱曰：「我與你拈鬮；拈著的便去。」王忠拈著「先」字，只得分一半軍馬，來攻徐州。,"The five legions under Liu Dai and Wang Zhong went into camp thirty-five miles from Xuzhou. The camp made an imposing display of the banners of the Prime Minister, but no attacks followed. Their spies were very busy north of the river to get news of Cao Cao's movement. On the defensive side, Liu Bei, as he was uncertain of the strength of the force against him, dared not move.Suddenly orders came for the Cao Cao's army to attack, and then discord showed itself.Liu Dai said, ""The Prime Minister orders an attack: You advance.""Wang Zhong replied, ""You were named first.""""I am the Commander-in-Chief. It is not my place to go first.""""I will go with you in joint command,"" said Wang Zhong.""Let us cast lots, and he upon whom the lot falls must go,"" said Liu Dai.They drew lots, and it fell to Wang Zhong, who advanced toward Xuzhou with half the force."
玄德聽知軍馬到來，請陳登商議曰：「袁本初雖屯兵黎陽，奈謀臣不和，尚未進取。曹操不知在何處。聞黎陽軍中，無操旗號，如何這裏卻反有他旗號？」登曰：「操詭計百出，必以河北為重，親自監督，卻故意不建旗號，乃於此處虛張聲勢。吾意操必不在此。」玄德曰：「兩弟誰可探聽虛實？」張飛曰：「小弟願往。」玄德曰：「汝為人躁暴，不可去。」飛曰：「便是有曹操也挐將來！」雲長曰：「待弟往觀其動靜。」玄德曰：「雲長若去，我卻放心。」,"When Liu Bei heard of the threatened attack, he called Chen Deng to consult.Liu Bei said, ""There is dissension in Yuan Shao's camp at Liyang, so they do not advance. We do not know where Cao Cao is, but his own banner is not displayed in his Liyang's camp. Why then is it shown here?""Chen Deng replied, ""His tricks take a hundred forms. It must be that he regards the north as more important and has gone there to look after its defense. He dares not show his flag there, and I feel sure it is only meant to mislead us. He is not here.""Liu Bei then asked whether one of his brothers would find out the truth, and Zhang Fei volunteered to go.""I fear you are unsuited for this,"" said Liu Bei. ""You are too impetuous.""""If Cao Cao is there, I will haul him over here,"" said Zhang Fei.""Let me go first and find out,"" said Guan Yu.""If you go, I shall feel more at ease,"" said Liu Bei."
於是雲長引三千人馬出徐州來。時值初冬，陰雲布合，雪花亂飄，軍馬皆冒雪布陣。雲長驟馬提刀而出，大叫王忠打話。忠出曰：「丞相到此，緣何不降？」雲長曰：「請丞相出陣，我自有話說。」忠曰：「丞相豈肯輕見你！」雲長大怒，驟馬向前。王忠挺鎗來迎。兩馬相交，雲長撥馬便走。王忠趕來，轉過山坡，雲長回馬，大叫一聲，舞刀直取。王忠攔截不住，恰得驟馬奔逃，雲長左手倒提寶刀，右手揪住王忠勒甲縧，拖下鞍鞽，橫擔於馬上，回本陣來。王忠軍四散奔走。,"So Guan Yu set out with three thousand soldiers to reconnoiter. It was then early winter, and snow was falling from a gloomy sky. They marched regardless of the snow and came near Wang Zhong's camp with arms all ready to attack. Guan Yu summoned Wang Zhong to a parley.""The Prime Minister is here. Why do you not surrender?"" said Wang Zhong.""Beg him to come to the front, for I would speak with him,"" replied Guan Yu.""Is he likely to come out to see such as you,"" said Wang Zhong.Guan Yu angrily dashed forward, and Wang Zhong set his spear to meet him. Guan Yu rode till he came close to his antagonist, then suddenly wheeled away. Wang Zhong went after him and followed up a slope. Just as they passed the crest, Guan Yu suddenly wheeled again, shouted, and came on flourishing the mighty sword. Wang Zhong could not withstand that and fled. But Guan Yu, changing the huge sword to his left hand, with his right laid hold of his victim by the straps of his breastplate, lifted him out of the saddle, and rode away to his own lines with the captive laid across the pommel of his saddle. Wang Zhong's army scattered."
雲長押解王忠，回徐州見玄德。玄德問：「你乃何人？見居何職？敢詐稱曹丞相！」忠曰：「焉敢有詐？奉命教我虛張聲勢，以為疑兵。丞相實不在此。」玄德教付衣服酒食，且暫監下，待捉了劉岱，再作商議。雲長曰：「某知兄有和解之意，故生擒將來。」玄德曰：「吾恐翼德躁暴，殺了王忠，故不教去。此等人殺之無益，留之可為解和之地。」,"The captive was sent to Xuzhou, where he was summoned into the presence of Liu Bei.""Who are you? What office do you hold? How dare you falsely display the ensigns of the Prime Minister?"" said Liu Bei.""What do you mean by falsely when I simply obeyed my orders?"" said Wang Zhong. ""My master wanted to produce the impression that he was present. Really he was not there.""Liu Bei treated him kindly, giving him food and clothing, but put him in prison till his colleague could be captured.Guan Yu said to Liu Bei, ""I knew you had peaceful intentions in your mind; therefore, I captured Wang Zhong instead of slaying him.""""I was afraid of Zhang Fei's hasty and impulsive temper,"" said Liu Bei. ""He would have slain this man. So I could not send him. There is no advantage in killing people of this sort, and while alive they are often useful in amicable settlements."""
張飛曰：「二哥捉了王忠，我去生擒劉岱來！」玄德曰：「劉岱昔為袞州刺史，虎牢伐董卓時，也是一鎮諸侯。今日為前軍，不可輕敵。」飛曰：「量此輩何足道哉！我也似二哥生擒將來便了！」玄德曰：「只恐壞了他性命，誤我大事。」飛曰：「如殺了，我償他命！」玄德遂與軍三千。飛引兵前進。,"Here Zhang Fei said, ""You have got this Wang Zhong; now I will go and get the other man.""""Be careful,"" said Liu Bei. ""Liu Dai was once Imperial Protector of Yanzhou, and he was one of the nobles who met at Tiger Trap Pass to destroy Dong Zhuo. He is not to be despised.""""I do not think him worth talking about so much. I will bring him in alive just as Second Brother did this other.""""I fear that if his life be lost, it may upset our designs,"" said Liu Bei.""If I kill him, I will forfeit my own life,"" said Zhang Fei.So he was given three thousand soldiers and went off quickly."
卻說劉岱知王忠被擒，堅守不出。張飛每日在寨前叫罵，岱聽知是張飛，越不敢出。飛守了數日，見岱不出，心生一計：傳令今夜二更去劫寨，日間卻在帳中飲酒，詐醉尋軍士罪過，打了一頓，縛在營中曰：「待我今夜出兵時，將來祭旗！」卻暗使左右縱之去。軍士得脫，偷走出營，逕往劉岱營中來報劫寨之事。劉岱見降卒身受重傷，遂聽其說，虛紮空寨，伏兵在外。,"The capture of his colleague made Liu Dai careful. He strengthened his defenses and kept behind them. He took no notice of the daily challenges and continual insults which began with Zhang Fei's arrival.After some days Zhang Fei evolved a ruse. He issued orders to prepare to rush the enemy's camp at night, but he himself spent the day drinking. Pretending to be very intoxicated, he held a court-martial, and one soldier was severely flogged for a breach of discipline.The man was left bound in the midst of the camp, Zhang Fei saying, ""Wait till I am ready to start tonight: You shall be sacrificed to the flag.""At the same time he gave secret orders to the custodians to let the man escape. The man found his opportunity, crept out of camp, and went over to the enemy, to whom he betrayed the plan of a night attack. As the man bore signs of savage punishment, Liu Dai was the more disposed to credit his desertion and tale. So Liu Dai made his arrangements, putting the greater part of his troops in ambush outside his camp so that it was empty."
是夜張飛卻分兵三路，中間使三十餘人，劫寨放火；卻教兩路軍抄出他寨後，看火起為號，夾擊之。二更時分，張飛自引精兵，先斷劉岱後路；中路三十餘人，搶入寨中放火。劉岱伏兵恰待殺入，張飛兩路兵齊出。岱軍自亂，正不知飛兵多少，各自潰散。劉岱引一隊殘軍，奪路而走，正撞見張飛；狹路相逢，急難回避；交馬只一合，早被張飛生擒過去。餘眾皆降。,"That night, having divided his army into three parties, Zhang Fei went to attack the camp. A few men were ordered to advance directly, dash in and set fire going. Two larger bodies of troops were to go round to the rear of the camp and attack when they saw the fire well started. At the third watch, Zhang Fei, with his veterans, went to cut off Liu Dai's road to the rear.The thirty men told off to start a conflagration made their way into the camp and were successful. When the flames arose, the ambushing troops rushed out but only to find themselves attacked on both sides. This confused them, and as they knew nothing of the number of their assailants, they were panic stricken and scattered.Liu Dai, with a company of footmen got clear of the fight and fled, but he went straight toward Zhang Fei. Escape was impossible, and the two men rode up each to attack the other. Zhang Fei captured his opponent, and the men surrendered."
飛使人先報入徐州。玄德聞之，謂雲長曰：「翼德自來粗莽，今亦用智，吾無憂矣。」乃親自出郭迎之。飛曰：「哥哥道我躁暴，今日如何？」玄德曰：「不用言語相激，如何肯使機謀？」飛大笑。玄德見縛劉岱過來，慌下馬解其縛曰：「小弟張飛誤有冒瀆，望乞恕罪。」遂迎入徐州，放出王忠，一同款待。玄德曰：「前因車冑欲害備，故不得不殺之。丞相錯疑備反，遣二將軍前來問罪。備受丞相大恩，正思報效，安敢反耶？二將軍至許都，望善言為備分訴，備之幸也。」劉岱、王忠曰：「深荷使君不殺之恩，當於丞相處方便，以某兩家老小保使君。」,"Zhang Fei sent news of this success to his brothers. Liu Bei said, ""Hitherto Zhang Fei has been rather violent, but this time he has acted wisely, and I am very pleased.""They rode out to welcome Zhang Fei.""You said I was too rough. How now?"" said Zhang Fei to his brothers.""If I had not put you on your mettle, you would not have evolved this stratagem,"" said Liu Bei.Zhang Fei laughed. Then appeared the captive Liu Dai, in bonds.Liu Bei at once dismounted and loosed the cords, saying, ""My young brother was rather hasty, but you must pardon him.""So Liu Dai was freed. He was taken into the city, his colleague was released, and both were cared for.Liu Bei said to them, ""I could not help putting Deputy Imperial Protector Che Zhou to death when he tried to kill me, but Cao Cao took it as disaffection and sent you two generals to punish me. I have received much kindness from him and certainly would not show ingratitude by killing you. I wish you to speak for me and explain when you get back.""""We are deeply grateful that you spare our lives, and we will certainly do so in gratitude for what our wives and children owe you."""
玄德稱謝。次日盡還原領軍馬，送出郭外。劉岱、王忠行不上十餘里，一聲鼓響，張飛攔路大喝曰：「我哥哥忒沒分曉！捉位賊將如何又放了？」嚇得劉岱、王忠在馬上發顫。張飛睜眼挺鎗趕來，背後一人飛馬大叫：「不得無禮！」視之，乃雲長也。劉岱、王忠方纔放心。雲長曰：「既兄長放了，吾弟如何不遵法令？」飛曰：「今番放了，下次又來。」雲長曰：「待他再來，殺之未遲。」劉岱、王忠連聲告退曰：「便丞相誅我三族，也不來了。望將軍寬恕。」飛曰：「便是曹操自來，也殺他片甲不回！今番權且記下兩顆頭！」劉岱、王忠抱頭鼠竄長、翼德回見玄德曰：「曹操必然復來。」孫乾謂玄德曰：「徐州受敵之地，不可久居；不若分兵屯小沛，守邳城，為犄角之勢，以防曹操。」玄德用其言，令雲長守下邳；甘、糜二夫人亦於下邳安置──甘夫人乃小沛人也，糜夫人乃糜竺之妹也。──孫乾、簡雍、糜竺、糜芳守徐州。玄德與張飛屯小沛。,"Next day the two leaders and their army were allowed to depart unscathed. But before they had got three miles from the boundary, they heard a mighty shouting and there appeared Zhang Fei barring the road.""My brother made a mistake in letting you go. He did not understand. How could he give freedom to two rebels?""This made the two men quake with fear, but as the fierce eyed warrior with uplifted sword was bearing down upon them, they heard another man galloping up and shouting, ""Do not behave so disgracefully!""The newcomer was Guan Yu, and his appearance relieved the unhappy men of all fear.""Why do you stop them since our brother set them free?"" cried Guan Yu.""If they are let go today, they will surely come back,"" cried Zhang Fei.""Wait till they do, then you may kill them,"" replied Guan Yu.The two leaders with one voice cried, ""Even if the Prime Minister slay our whole clans, we will never come again. We pray you pardon us.""Said Zhang Fei, ""If Cao Cao himself had come, I would have slain him. Not a breastplate should have gone back. But for this time I leave you your heads.""Clapping their hands to their heads the two men scuttled off while the two brothers returned to the city.""Cao Cao will certainly come,"" said Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.Sun Qian said, ""This is not a city that can hold out for long. We should send part of our forces to Xiaopei and guard Xiapi as a corner stone of our position.""Liu Bei agreed and told off Guan Yu to guard Xiapi whither he also sent his two wives, Lady Gan and Lady Mi. The former was a native of Xiapi; the latter was Mi Zhu's younger sister.Sun Qian, Jian Yong, Mi Zhu, and Mi Fang were left to defend Xuzhou, and Liu Bei with Zhang Fei went to Xiaopei."
劉岱、王忠回見曹操，具言劉備不反之事。操怒罵：「辱國之徒，留你何用！」喝令左右推出斬之。正是：犬豕何堪共虎鬥，魚蝦空自與龍爭。不知二人性命如何，且看下文分解。,"The two released leaders, Liu Dai and Wang Zhong, hastened home to Cao Cao and explained to him that Liu Bei was not disaffected.But their master was exceeding angry with them, crying, ""You shameful traitors, what use are you?""He roared to the guards to take them away to instant execution.How can a hare or a deer expectTo conquer in tiger strife?Minnows and shrimps that with dragons contendAlready have done with life.The fate of the two leaders will be told in the next chapter."
