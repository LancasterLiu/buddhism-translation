卻說曹操部下諸將中，自張遼而外，只有徐晃與雲長交厚，其餘亦皆敬服；獨蔡陽不服關公，故今日聞其去，欲住追之。操曰：「不忘故主，來去明白，真丈夫也。汝等皆當效之。」遂叱退蔡陽，不令去趕。程昱曰：「丞相待關某甚厚，今彼不辭而去，亂言片楮，冒瀆鈞威，其罪大矣。若縱之使歸袁紹，是與虎添翼也。不若追而殺之，以絕後患。」,"Now of all the officers in Cao Cao's army, the two friendly toward Guan Yu were Zhang Liao and Xu Huang. The others treated Guan Yu with respect, except Cai Yang who was decidedly inimical. So this Cai Yang was ready to pursue and capture Guan Yu as soon as he heard of his departure. But Cao Cao accepted Guan Yu's going as natural.""He does not forget his old leader, and he was perfectly open in all his actions. He is a gentleman, and you would do well to follow his example,"" said Cao Cao.So Cao Cao bade the would-be pursuer be gone and say no more about pursuit.""You were exceedingly good to Guan Yu,"" said Cheng Yu, ""but he went off very rudely. He certainly left a screed behind with his reasons, but he affronted you, and that is no light matter. Now to let him join Yuan Shao is to add wings to a tiger. You had better catch him and put him to death so as to guard against future evil."""
操曰：「吾昔已許之，豈可失信？彼各為其主，勿追也。」因謂張遼曰：「雲長封金挂印，財賄不足以動其心，爵祿不足以移其志，此等人吾深敬之。想他去此不遠，我一發結識他做個人情。汝可先去請住他，待我與他送行，更以路費征袍贈之，使為後日記念。」張遼領命，單騎先往。曹操引數十騎隨後而來。,"Cao Cao replied, ""But he had my promise, and can I break my word? Each has his master. Do not pursue.""But Cao Cao said to Zhang Liao, ""He has rejected all I gave him, so bribes were powerless with him in whatever shape. I have the greatest respect for such as him. He has not yet gone far, and I will try to strengthen his attachment to me and make one appeal to sentiment. Ride after him and beg him to stop till I can come up and bid farewell and offer him a sum of money for his expenses and a fighting robe, that he may remember me kindly in after days.""So Zhang Liao rode out quite alone. Cao Cao followed him leisurely with an escort of a score or so."
卻說雲長所騎赤馬，日行千里，本是趕不上；因欲護送車仗，不敢縱馬，按轡徐行。忽聽背後有人大叫：「雲長且慢行！」回頭視之，見張遼拍馬而至。關公教車仗從人，只管望大路緊行；自己勒住赤兔馬，按定青龍刀，問曰：「文遠莫非欲追我回乎？」遼曰：「非也。丞相知兄遠行，欲來相送，特先使我請住台駕，別無他意。」關公曰：「便是丞相鐵騎來，吾願決一死戰！」遂立馬於橋上望之。見曹操引數十騎，飛奔前來；背後乃是許褚，徐晃，于禁，李典之輩。,"Now the steed that Guan Yu rode was Red Hare, and it was very fast. No one could have come up with him but that there was the ladies' carriage to escort, and so Red Hare had to be held in and go slow. Suddenly Guan Yu heard a shout behind him, a voice crying, ""Go slowly, Guan Yu!""He turned and made out the person to be Zhang Liao. Ordering the pushers of the carriage to press on along the high road, he reined in his steed, held the green-dragon saber ready for a stroke, and waited for Zhang Liao to come up.""Of course you have come to take me back, Zhang Liao?"" said Guan Yu.""No. The Prime Minister, seeing that you are going a long journey, wishes to see you on your way and told me to hasten forward and beg you to wait till he can come up. That is the only thing.""""Seeing that he is coming along with mailed men, I shall fight to the very last,"" said Guan Yu.And he took up his position on a bridge where he waited the approach of the party, who advanced quickly. Four of Cao Cao's generals, Xu Chu, Xu Huang, Yu Jin, and Li Dian, followed close."
操見關公橫刀立馬於橋上，令諸將勒住馬匹，左右排開。關公見眾人手中皆無軍器，方始放心。操曰：「雲長行何太速？」關公於馬上欠身答曰：「關某前曾稟過丞相，今故主在河北，不由某不急去。累次造府，不得參見，故拜書告辭，封金挂印，納還丞相。望丞相勿忘昔日之言。」操曰：「吾欲取信於天下，安肯有負前言？恐將軍途中乏用，等具路資相送。」一將便從馬上托過黃金一盤。,"Seeing Guan Yu was ready to fight, Cao Cao ordered his escort to open out in two lines, and then it was seen they carried no arms. This relieved his mind, for it proved to Guan Yu they meant no attack.""Why do you go in such haste, Guan Yu?"" asked Cao Cao.Guan Yu inclined his head but did not dismount, saying, ""I informed you in writing that since my lord was in the North of Yellow River, I had to leave at once. I went to your palace again and again but was refused admittance. So I wrote a letter of farewell, sealed up the treasure, resigned my lordship seal, and left everything for you. I hope you recall the promise you once made me.""Cao Cao replied, ""My desire is to keep my troth with all people. I cannot go back on my word. However, you may find the journey expensive, and therefore I have here prepared a sum of money to help you.""Then from horseback Cao Cao held out a packet of gold."
關公曰：「累蒙恩賜，尚有餘資。留此黃金以賞將士。」操曰：「特以少酬大功於萬一，何必推辭？」關公曰：「區區微勞，何足挂齒。」操笑曰：「雲長天下義士，恨吾福薄，不得相留。錦袍一領，略表寸心。」令一將下馬，雙手捧袍過來。雲長恐有他變，不敢下馬，用青龍刀尖挑錦袍披於身上，勒馬回頭稱謝曰：「蒙丞相賜袍，異日更得相會。」遂下橋望北而去。,"Guan Yu said, ""I have sufficient left from your former bounty. Keep that for presents to your soldiers.""""Why should you refuse this? It is but an insignificant return for great services.""""My services have been all trifling, not worth mentioning.""""Really, Guan Yu, you are the most high-principled of humans. I am very sorry my luck is too poor to retain you at my side. Pray accept just this robe to show you I am not quite ungrateful,"" said Cao Cao.And one of his generals, dismounting, held up a silken coat in both hands. Guan Yu even still fearful of what might happen, would not dismount, but he reached down his sword and took the robe on its point. Then he threw it over his shoulders and turned to thank the giver.""I thank you, Sir Prime Minister, for the robe and trust we shall meet again.""So saying, Guan Yu went down from the bridge and bore away to the north."
許褚曰：「此人無禮太甚，何不擒之？」操曰：「彼一人一騎，吾數十餘人，安得不疑？吾言既出，不可追也。」曹操自引眾將回城，於路歎想雲長不已。,"""He is a very rude man,"" said Xu Chu, who was of the escort. ""Why do you not take him prisoner?""Cao Cao replied, ""He was absolutely alone facing scores of us. He was justified in being suspicious. But my word has gone forth, and he is not to be pursued."" Cao Cao and his escort returned, the Prime Minister very sad when he thought of the man who had gone."
不說曹操自回。且說關公來趕車仗，約行三十里，卻只不見。雲長心慌，縱馬四下尋之。忽見山頭一人，高叫：「關將軍且住！」雲長舉目視之，只見一少年，黃巾錦衣，持槍跨馬，馬項下懸著首級一顆，引百餘步卒，飛奔前來。公問曰：「汝何人也？」,"Guan Yu went down from the bridge and started in the wake of the carriage carrying the two ladies, which should have gone about ten miles while this interview had been going on. He could see no signs of it and rode hither and thither looking on all sides.Presently he heard someone shouting from a hill, calling him by name to halt. He saw a youth wearing a yellow turban and dressed in a silk robe. He held a spear in his hand and was mounted on a horse from the neck of which dangled a bloody head. Behind him were a hundred or so men on foot, and they advanced quickly.""Who are you?"" asked Guan Yu."
少年棄鎗下馬，拜伏於地。雲長恐是詐，勒馬持刀問曰：「壯士，願通姓名。」答曰：「吾本襄陽人；姓廖，名化，字元儉。因世亂流落江湖，聚眾五百餘人，劫掠為生。恰纔同伴杜遠下山巡哨，誤將兩夫人劫掠上山。吾問從者，知是大漢劉皇叔夫人。且聞將軍護送在此，吾即欲送下山來。杜遠出言不遜，被某殺之。今獻頭與將軍請罪。」關公曰：「二夫人何在？」化曰：「現在山中。」關公教急取下山。不移時，百餘人簇擁車仗前來。,"The young man dropped his spear, dismounted, and made a low bow. Guan Yu feared this was some ruse, so he only checked his horse and gripped his sword the more firmly, saying, ""Sir, I desire you to tell me your name!""""My name is Liao Hua. I belong to a Xiangyang family. Since these troubled times began I have been an outlaw among the rivers and lakes, and I and my comrades have lived by plunder. We are about five hundred in all. By chance my friend Du Yuan came across two ladies in a carriage just now; and, quite wrongly, he took them prisoners and brought them to the hold in the hills. I questioned the servants and so found out who they were and who was escorting them. So I wished them to be set free to pursue their journey. Du Yuan opposed this and spoke so ill-mannerly that I killed him. And here is his head. I pray you pardon me.""""Where are the two ladies?""""They are among the hills,"" replied Liao Hua.""Bring them down here, at once,"" said Guan Yu.In a short time a party of the brigands pushed the carriage down the hill, and the ladies sat there before him."
關公下馬停刀，叉手於車前問候曰：「二嫂受驚否？」二夫人曰：「若非廖將軍保全，已被杜遠所辱。」關公問左右曰：「廖化怎生救夫人？」左右曰：「杜遠劫上山去，就要與廖化各分一人為妻。廖化問起根由，好生拜敬；杜遠不從，已被廖化殺了。」關公聽言，乃拜謝廖化。廖化欲以部下人送關公。關公尋思此人終是黃巾餘黨，未可作伴，乃謝卻之。廖化又拜送金帛，關公亦不受。廖化拜別，自引人伴山谷中去了。,"Then Guan Yu dismounted, laid aside his sword, and stood respectfully before them with his arms crossed.""Sisters, have you been alarmed?"" asked he.They replied, ""We should have suffered at the hands of Du Yuan had it not been for Liao Hua.""""How did Liao Hua come to save the ladies?"" asked Guan Yu of those who stood by.They said, ""Du Yuan carried off the ladies and proposed that he and Liao Hua should have one each as wife. But Liao Hua had found out they were of gentle birth and worthy, and was for treating them with respect. When Du Yuan disagreed, Liao Hua slew him.""Hearing this Guan Yu bowed to Liao Hua and thanked him. Liao Hua then wanted to join himself and his troop to Guan Yu, but Guan Yu, seeing he was a Yellow Scarf, would have nothing to do with him. So Guan Yu simply thanked him for his kindness to the ladies. Liao Hua offered some presents, but these were also declined.So Liao Hua took his leave and presently disappeared in a valley among the hills."
雲長將曹操贈袍事，告知二嫂，催促車仗前行。至天晚，投一村莊安歇。莊主出迎，鬚髮皆白，問曰：「將軍姓甚名誰？關公施禮曰：「吾乃劉玄德之弟關某也。」老人曰：「莫非斬顏良，文醜的關公否？」公曰：「便是。」老人大喜，便請入莊。關公曰：「車上還有二位夫人。」老人便喚妻女出迎。,"Guan Yu told his sisters the story of his interview with Cao Cao and the gift of a robe, and then he urged the carriage on its way. Towards dark they came to a farm where they would rest. The farmer, an old graybeard, came out to welcome the party and asked who they were. Guan Yu described himself as the brother of Liu Bei, and said his name.""Surely you are no other than the slayer of Yan Liang and Wen Chou,"" said the venerable host.""That is so,"" replied Guan Yu.""Come in,"" said the old man, joyfully.""My two sisters-in-law are in the carriage,"" said Guan Yu. ""Will you let your women folks go out to receive them?"""
二夫人至草堂上，關公叉手立於二夫人之側。老人請公坐，公曰：「尊嫂在上，安敢就坐？」老人乃令妻女請二夫人入內室款待，自於草堂款待關公。關公問老人姓名。老人曰：「吾姓胡，名華。桓時曾為議郎，致仕歸鄉。今有小兒胡班，在滎陽太守王植部下為從事。將軍若從此處經過，某有一書寄與小兒。」,"As Guan Yu remained standing there, the host asked him to be seated, but he would not sit while the women were present and remained standing in a respectful attitude till the old man's wife had returned and ushered the ladies into the inner apartments. Then the old man set to the entertainment of his guest in the guest hall. Guan Yu asked his name.He replied, ""I am called Hu Hua. In the days of the Emperor Huan, I was an officer of the court, but I resigned and retired into private life. I have a son, Hu Ban, with Governor Wang Zhi of Yingyang. If you should be going that way, General, I should like to send him a letter by you."""
關公允諾。次日早膳畢，請二嫂上車，取了胡華書信，相別而行，取路投洛陽來。前至一關，名東嶺關。把關將姓孔，名秀，引五百軍兵在土嶺上把守。當日關公押車仗上嶺，軍士報知孔秀，秀出關來迎。關公下馬，與孔秀施禮。秀曰：「將軍何往？」公曰：「某辭丞相，特往河北尋兄。」秀曰：「河北袁紹，正是丞相對頭；將軍此去，必有丞相文憑。」公曰：「因行期忽迫，不曾討得。」秀曰：「既無文憑，待我差人稟過丞相，方可放行。」關公曰：「待去稟時，須誤了我行程。」秀曰：「法度所拘，不得不如此。」關公曰：「汝不容我過關乎？」秀曰：「汝要過去，留下老小為質。」,"Guan Yu said he would take the letter. Next day, after an early meal, the ladies got into their carriage, the host handed his letter to Guan Yu, and the little party once more took the road. They went toward Luoyang.Presently they approached a pass known as the Dongling Pass, guarded by Commander Kong Xiu and five hundred soldiers. When the soldiers saw a carriage being pushed toward the pass, they ran to tell their commander, who came out to accost the travelers.Guan Yu dismounted and returned the officer's salute, and Kong Xiu said, ""Whither are you going?""""I have left the Prime Minister to go into the North of Yellow River to find my brother.""""But Yuan Shao is my master's rival. You have authority from him to go thither?""""I left hurriedly and could not get it.""""If you have no authority, you must wait while I send to request orders.""""To remain while you send and receive an answer will delay me greatly,"" said Guan Yu.""I must stand by my instructions. That is the only thing to do,"" said Kong Xiu.""Then you refuse to let me pass?""""If you want to go through, leave the family as a gage."""
關公大怒，舉刀就殺孔秀。秀退入關去，鳴鼓聚軍，披挂上馬，殺下關來，大喝曰：「汝今敢過去麼！」關公約退車仗，縱馬提刀，竟不打話，直取孔秀。秀挺鎗來迎。兩馬相交，只一合，鋼刀起處，孔秀屍橫馬下。眾軍便走。關公曰：「軍士休走。吾殺孔秀，不得已也，與汝等無干。借汝眾軍之口，傳語曹丞相，言孔秀欲害我，我故殺之。」,"At this Guan Yu got very angry and made to cut at the commander on the spot, but Kong Xiu withdrew into the gate and beat the drums for an attack. Thereupon the soldiers armed themselves, mounted, and came down to oppose the passage, crying, ""Dare you go through, eh?""The carriage was sent off to a safe distance, and then Guan Yu rode at full speed directly at the commander, who set his spear and came to meet him.The two steeds met and the men engaged, but at the first stroke of the green-dragon saber the commander of the gate fell to the earth dead. His troops fled.""Soldiers, do not flee!"" cried Guan Yu. ""I killed him because I could do no otherwise. I have nothing against you, but I would ask you to tell the Prime Minister how this thing came to pass, that Kong Xiu wished to kill me, and so I slew him in self defense."""
眾軍俱拜於馬前。關公即請二夫人車仗出關，望洛陽進發。早有軍士報知洛陽太守韓福。韓福急聚眾將商議。牙將孟坦曰：「既無丞相文憑，即係私行；若不阻擋，必有罪責。」韓福曰：「關公勇猛，顏良，文醜，俱為所殺。今不可力敵，只須設計擒之。」孟坦曰：「吾有一計：先將鹿角攔定關口，待他到時，小將引兵和他交鋒，佯敗誘他來追，公可用暗箭射之。若關某墜馬，即擒解許都，必得重賞。」,"The soldiers bowed before him, and Guan Yu, with the carriage, passed through the gates and continued their way to Luoyang. But one of the guards of the pass went quickly in advance and informed the Governor of Luoyang, Han Qu, of the slaughter of Kong Xiu. Wherefore Han Qu assembled his officers to take counsel.Meng Tan, one of his generals, said, ""This Guan Yu must be a fugitive, or he would have a safe conduct. Our only course is to stop him, or we shall incur blame.""""The man is fierce and brave. Remember the fate of Yan Liang and Wen Chou. It seems vain to oppose him by force, and so we must think out some trap for him,"" said Han Qu.""I have a ruse ready,"" said Meng Tan. ""I will close the gate with thorny blockades, and I will go to fight with him. I will engage and then flee, and you can shoot him from an ambush along the road. If we can get him and his party and send them prisoners to the capital, we ought to be well rewarded."""
商議停當，人報關公車仗已到。韓福彎弓插箭，引一千人馬，排列關口，問：「來者何人？」關公馬上欠身言曰：「吾漢壽亭侯關某，敢借過路。」韓福曰：「有曹丞相文憑否？」關公曰：「事冗不曾討得。」韓福曰：「吾奉丞相鈞命，鎮守此地，專一盤詰往來奸細。若無文憑，即係逃竄。」關公怒曰：「東嶺孔秀，已被吾殺。汝亦欲尋死耶？」韓福曰：「誰人與我擒之？」,"This course was determined upon, and soon they heard that Guan Yu was approaching. Han Qu strung his bow and filled his quiver with arrows and with one thousand soldiers took up position along the pass.Then as the party approached, Han Qu said, ""Who is the traveler who comes?""Guan Yu bowed low and said, ""He is a certain Guan Yu, Lord of Hanshou, and he wishes to go through the pass.""""Have you a letter from the Prime Minister?""""In the hurry of departure I did not get any.""""My special orders from him are to hold this pass and make examination of all spies that may go to and fro. Any person without an authority must be a fugitive.""Then Guan Yu began to be angry, saying, ""I have killed Kong Xiu at Dongling Pass. Do you also seek death?""""Who will capture him for me?"" cried Han Qu."
孟坦出馬，輪雙刀來取關公。關公約退車仗，拍馬來迎。孟坦戰不三合，撥回馬便走。關公趕來。孟坦只指望引誘關公，不想關公馬快，早已趕上，只一刀砍為兩段。關公勒馬回來，韓福閃在門首，盡力放了一箭，正射中關公左臂。公用口拔出箭，血流不住，飛馬逕奔韓福，衝散眾軍。韓福急閃不及，關公手起刀落，帶頭連肩，斬於馬下；殺散眾軍，保護車仗。,"Meng Tan offered himself and rode out, whirling his double swords, and made straight for Guan Yu.Guan Yu sent back the carriage out of danger and then rode toward Meng Tan. They engaged, but very soon Meng Tan turned his steed and fled. Guan Yu pursued. Meng Tan, intent only on leading his enemy toward the ambush, took no account of the speed of Red Hare. Very soon Meng Tan was caught up, and a stroke of the mighty sword cut him in two pieces. Then Guan Yu stopped and turned back. The archers in the gate shot their hardest; and though it was a long way off, one of them lodged an arrow in his left arm. He pulled it out with his teeth, but the blood streamed down as he rode toward Governor Han Qu. The men scattered. Guan Yu rode straight at his next victim. He raised his sword and made an oblique cut which sliced off the head and shoulder of Han Qu.Then Guan Yu drove off the soldiers and returned to escort the carriage."
關公割帛束住箭傷，於路恐人暗算，不敢久住，連夜投沂水關來。把關將乃并州人氏，姓卞，名喜，善使流星鎚；原是黃巾餘黨，後投曹操，撥來守關。當下聞知關公將到，尋思一計；就關前鎮國寺中，埋伏下刀斧手二百餘人，誘關公至寺，約擊盞為號，欲圖相害。安排已定，出關迎接關公。公見卞喜來迎，便下馬相見。喜曰：「將軍名震天下，誰不敬仰！今歸皇叔，足見忠義！」關公訴說斬孔秀，韓福之事。卞喜曰：「將軍殺之是也。某見丞相，代稟衷曲。」關公甚喜，同上馬過了沂水關，到鎮國寺前下馬。眾僧鳴鐘出迎。原來那鎮國寺乃漢明帝御前香火院，本寺有僧三十餘人。內有一僧，卻是關公同鄉人，法名普淨。,"He bound up his wound, and, fearing lest anyone might take advantage of his weakness, he made no long halts on the road but hurried toward River Si Pass.The warden of this pass was Bian Xi of Bingzhou, a warrior whose weapon was a comet-hammer. He had been a Yellow Scarf and had gone over to Cao Cao, who had given him this post. As soon as he heard of the coming of the redoubtable Guan Yu, he cudgeled his brains for a ruse to use against him. He decided upon an ambush. In the State Guardian Temple at the pass he placed two hundred ax-men and swordsmen. He reckoned on enticing Guan Yu to the temple for refreshment, and when he let fall a cup as signal, the hidden ruffians would rush out.All being thus arranged and ready, he went out to welcome Guan Yu in friendly guise, and Guan Yu dismounted at his coming. Bian Xi began very amiably.""Your name, General, makes the very earth tremble, and everyone looks up to you. This return to the Imperial Uncle proves you to be noble and true.""Guan Yu in reply told him the story of the men he had slain in the last two passes.Bian Xi replied, ""You slew them; that is well. When I see the Prime Minister, I will explain to him the inner reasons for these acts.""Guan Yu thought he had found a friend and so mounted and rode through the pass. When he came to the temple, a number of priests came out to meet him with clanging bells.This temple, named State Guardian Temple, had a courtyard in which the Emperor Ming had burned incense in the past. In the temple were thirty priests, and among these there happened to be one Pu Jing who came from the same village as Guan Yu. His religious name was Transverse Peace."
當下普淨已知其意，向前與關公問訊，曰：「將軍離蒲東幾年矣？」關公曰：「將及二十年矣。」普淨曰：「還認得貧僧否？」公曰：「離鄉多年，不能相識。」普淨曰：「貧僧家與將軍家只隔一條河。」卞喜見普淨敘出鄉里之情，恐有走泄，乃叱之曰：「吾欲請將軍赴宴，汝僧人何得多言！」關公曰：「不然。鄉人相遇，安得不敘舊情耶？」,"Hearing who the visitor was, Transverse Peace came forward to speak with him.""General,"" said Transverse Peace, ""it is many a long year since you left Pudong.""""Yes,"" said Guan Yu, ""nearly twenty years.""""Do you recognize this poor priest?""""I left the village many years ago; I do not recognize you.""""My house and yours were only separated by a rivulet,"" said the priest.Now Bian Xi, seeing Transverse Peace holding forth about village matters, thought Transverse Peace would blab about the ambush, so Bian Xi bade him be silent.""I want to invite the General to a feast. You priest fellows seem to have a lot to say,"" said Bian Xi.""Not too much,"" said Guan Yu. ""Naturally when fellow villagers meet, they talk of old times."""
普淨請關公方丈待茶。關公曰：「二位夫人在車上，可先獻茶。」普淨教取茶先奉夫人，然後請關入方丈。普淨以手舉所佩戒刀，以目視關公。公會意，命左右持刀緊隨。卞喜請關公於法堂筵席。關公曰：「卞君請關某，是好意？還是歹意？」卞喜未及回言，關公早望見壁衣中有刀斧手，乃大喝卞喜曰：「吾以汝為好人，安敢如此！」,"Bian Xi invited the visitor into the guest room to take tea, but Guan Yu said, ""The two ladies are out there in the carriage. They ought to have some first.""So the priest bade them take some tea to the ladies, and then he led Guan Yu within, at the same time lifting the priest knife which he wore at his side and looking meaningfully at Guan Yu. The latter understood and told his people to bring along his weapon and keep close at his side.When Bian Xi invited Guan Yu to go into the Hall of the Laws for some refreshment, Guan Yu turned to him, saying, ""Is this invitation with good intention or evil?""Bian Xi was so taken aback that he could make no reply, and then Guan Yu saw that many armed men were concealed behind the arras.Then Guan Yu shouted loudly at Bian Xi, saying, ""What means this? I thought you an honorable man. How dare you?"""
卞喜知事泄，大叫：「左右下手！」左右方欲動手，皆被關公拔劍砍之。卞喜下堂遶廊而走，關公棄劍執大刀來趕。卞喜暗取飛鎚擲打關公。關公用刀隔開鎚，趕將入去，一刀劈卞喜為兩段，隨即回身來看二嫂。早有軍人圍住，見關公來，四下奔走。關公趕散，謝普淨曰：「若非吾師，已被此賊害矣。」普淨曰：「貧僧此處難容，收拾衣缽，亦往他處雲游也。後會有期，將軍保重。」,"The traitor saw that his plot had failed and called to the assassins to come out and fall to, but Guan Yu had a short sword in his hand and slashed at anyone who came near. So they scattered. Their commander ran down the hall and tried to escape among the side buildings, but Guan Yu threw aside the short sword, took up the green-dragon saber and went after Bian Xi. The latter was trying to get into position to throw his comet-hammer, but Guan Yu cut the cord and the weapon was useless. Guan Yu followed Bian Xi in and out and soon caught up with him. Then with one blow Guan Yu cut him in halves. The fight over, Guan Yu sought the two ladies, who were surrounded by soldiers. These fled at sight of the terrible warrior. Seeking out the priest, his fellow countryman, he thanked him for the timely warning which had saved him from death.""I cannot remain here after this,"" said Transverse Peace. ""I shall pack up my few garments and my alms bowl and take to the road, vague in my wanderings as the clouds in the sky. But we shall meet again and till then take care of yourself."""
關公稱謝，護送車仗，住滎陽進發。滎陽太守王植，卻與韓福是兩親家；聞得關公殺了韓福，商議欲暗害關公，乃使人守住關口。待關公到時，王植出關，喜笑相迎。關公訴說尋兄之事。植曰：「將軍於路驅馳，夫人車上勞困，且請入城，館驛中暫歇一宵，來日登途未遲。」,"Then Guan Yu took leave and retook the road to Yingyang. The Governor of this city was named Wang Zhi, and he was related to Han Qu by their children's marriage. Hearing of the death of his relative, Wang Zhi set about a scheme to kill Guan Yu secretly. He sent soldiers to guard the city gates and, when he heard that Guan Yu approached, he went himself and received Guan Yu with a smiling countenance and bade Guan Yu welcome. Guan Yu told him the object of his journey.""You, General, have been able to get some exercise on the road, but the ladies in their carriage must be cramped and fatigued. I pray you come into the city, and all of you remain the night in the official travelers' quarters. Tomorrow you can set forth again."""
關公見王植意甚殷勤，遂請二嫂入城。館驛中皆鋪陳了當。王植請公赴宴，公辭不往；植使人送筵席至館驛。關公因於路辛苦，請二嫂膳畢，就正房歇定；令從者各自安歇，飽餵馬匹。關公亦解甲憩息。,"The offer was tempting, and his host seemed in earnest, so the two ladies went into the city, where they found everything very comfortably prepared for them. And, though Guan Yu declined the Governor's invitations to a banquet, refreshments for the travelers were sent to their lodgings. Guan Yu was fatigued from the trials of the journey, and as soon as the evening meal was over, he bade the ladies retire to rest while he sat down in the main room, quite alone, for he bade all to get repose while they could. His horse was given a good feed for once. He sat with his armor loosened in order to be more at ease."
卻說王植密喚從事胡班聽令曰：「關某背丞相而逃，又於路殺太守并守關將校，死罪不輕！此人武勇難敵。汝今晚點一千軍圍住館驛，一人一個火把，待三更時分，一齊放火；不問是誰，盡皆燒死！吾亦自引軍接應。」胡班領命，便點起軍士，密將乾柴引火之物，搬於館驛門首，約時舉事。胡班尋思：「我久聞關雲長之名，不識如何模樣，試往窺之。」乃至驛中，問驛吏曰：「關將軍在何處？」答曰：「正廳上觀書者是也。」,"Now Governor Wang Zhi had a general named Hu Ban to whom he had entrusted the arrangements for the destruction of his guest.Said Wang Zhi, ""This Guan Yu is a traitor to the Prime Minister and a fugitive. On the road he has murdered several pass commanders and is guilty of serious crimes. But he is too strong and valiant for any ordinary soldier to overcome. So this evening you will lead a whole company of a thousand troops to surround his lodging, each one armed with a torch, and we will burn him. They will start the fire about midnight. Everyone of the party will perish. I will come with a force to stand by and assist if necessary.""These orders received, Hu Ban passed them on to the soldiers, who began secretly to prepare dry wood and other combustibles which they piled up at the gate of the rest house. Hu Ban thought within himself that he would like to know what manner of man was this Guan Yu, whose fame had spread so far, so he determined to get a peep at the guest. He went to the rest house and inquired where Guan Yu was.""The General is the man in the main hall reading,"" was the reply."
胡班潛至廳前，見關公左手綽髯，於燈下几看書。班見了，失聲歎曰：「真天人也！」公問何人。胡班入拜曰：「滎陽太守部下從事胡班。」關公曰：「莫非許都城外胡華之子否？」班曰：「然也。」公喚從者於行李中取書付班。班看畢，歎曰：「險些誤殺忠良！」遂密告曰：「王植心懷不仁，欲害將軍，暗令人四面圍住館驛，約於三更放火。今某當先去開了城門，將軍急收拾出城。」,"Hu Ban noiselessly made his way to the outside of the room and peeped in. He saw the famous warrior stroking his beard with his left hand while he read by the light of a lamp placed on a low table. An involuntary exclamation of wonder escaped at the majesty of the figure.""Really a god!"" Hu Ban sighed.""Who is there?"" suddenly asked the reader at the sound.Hu Ban entered and said, ""I am Hu Ban, a general of the Governor.""""Surely you are the son of Hu Hua, who lives outside Xuchang,"" said Guan Yu.""I am he,"" replied Hu Ban.Then Guan Yu called up his followers and bade them look among the baggage for the letter, which they brought. Guan Yu handed it to the general.Hu Ban read it and then breathed long, saying, ""I very nearly caused the death of a good man.""Then he betrayed the whole plot, saying, ""This Wang Zhi is a wicked man, who wanted to kill you. At this moment you are surrounded, and at the third watch they will set fire to this place. Now I will go and open the city gates while you hastily prepare for flight."""
關公大驚，忙披挂提刀上馬，請二嫂上車，盡出館驛，果見軍士各執火把聽候。關公急來到城邊，只見城門已開。關公催車仗急急出城。胡班還去放火。關公行不到數里，背後火把照耀，人馬趕來。當先王植大叫：「關某休走！」關公勒馬，大罵：「匹夫！我與你無讎，如何令人放火燒我？」王植拍馬挺鎗，逕奔關公；被關公攔腰一刀，砍為兩段。人馬都趕散。關公催車仗速行，於路感胡班不已。,"Guan Yu was greatly surprised, but he quickly buckled up his armor, got his steed ready, roused the two ladies, and put them into their carriage. Then they left the rest house; and as they passed out, they saw the soldiers all about them, each with a torch. The party hastened to the outskirts of the city and found the gate already open, and they lost no time in getting clear of the city. Hu Ban returned to give orders to fire the rest house.The fugitives pressed on. But before long they saw lights coming up behind them, and Wang Zhi called out to them to stop.Guan Yu reined in his horse and began to abuse him, crying, ""Worthless fellow! What had you against me that you wished to burn me to death?""Wang Zhi whipped up his steed and set his spear, but Guan Yu cut him through with the short sword he wore at his side and scattered his followers.Then the carriage pushed on. Guan Yu's heart was filled with gratitude to Hu Ban."
行至滑州界首，有人報與劉延。延引數十騎，出郭而迎。關公馬上欠身而言曰：「太守別來無恙！」延曰：「公今欲何往？」公曰：「辭了丞相，去尋吾兄。」延曰：「玄德在袁紹處，紹乃丞相讎人，如何容公去？」公曰：「昔日曾言定來。」延曰：「今黃河渡口關隘，夏侯惇部將秦琪據守。恐不容將軍過去。」公曰：「太守應付船隻，若何？」延曰：「船隻雖有，不敢應付。」公曰：「我前者誅顏良，文醜，亦曾與足下解厄。今日求一渡船而不與，何也？」延曰：「只恐夏侯惇知之，必然罪我。」,"When the party drew near Huazhou, someone told Liu Yue, who rode out to welcome him. Liu Yue had been once rescued by Guan Yu, who slew Yan Liang and Wen Chou and lifted the siege of the city.Guan Yu did not dismount but bowed from horseback, saying, ""Have you been quite well since we parted?""""Whither are you going, Sir?"" replied Liu Yue.""I have left the Prime Minister and am on my way to find my brother.""""Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao, who is at enmity with the Prime Minister. How can you be allowed to go to him?"" asked Liu Yue.""That matter was settled long ago.""""The Yellow River Ferry is an important point and is guarded by a commander of Xiahou Dun. He will not let you cross.""""But suppose then you provide boats for me?""""Though there are boats, I dare not give them to you.""""Well, formerly I slew Yan Liang and Wen Chou and saved you a grave danger. Now you refuse me a ferry boat!""""I am afraid Xiahou Dun will know of it and make it a fault against me."""
關公知劉延無用之人，遂自催車仗前進。到黃河渡口，秦琪引軍出問來者何人？關公曰：「漢壽亭侯關某也。」琪曰：「今欲何往？」關公曰：「欲投河北去尋兄長劉玄德，敬來借渡。」琪曰：「丞相公文何在？」公曰：「吾不受丞相節制，有甚公文？」琪曰：「吾奉夏侯將軍將令，守把關隘，你便插翅，也飛不過去！」關公大怒曰：「你知我於路斬戮攔截者乎？」琪曰：「你只殺得無名下將，敢殺我麼？」關公怒曰：「汝比顏良，文醜，若何？」,"Guan Yu perceived that no help was to be expected from this man, so he pushed on and presently reached the ferry. There the Commander of the Guard, Qin Qi, came out to question him.""I am one Guan Yu, Lord of Hanshou.""""Whither are you bound?""""I go to the North of Yellow River to seek my brother, Liu Bei, and I respectfully ask you to grant me a passage over the river.""""Where is the authority of the Prime Minister?""""I am not on a mission from the Prime Minister, so why should I have such an authority?""""I have orders from my chief to guard the ferry, and you will not cross. Even if you grew wings, you should not fly over.""Guan Yu's choler arose.""Do you know that I have been the death of all those who have hitherto tried to stop me?"" said he.""You have only slain a few officers of no rank or reputation; but you dare not kill me!""""Where would you stand beside Yan Liang and Wen Chou?"" asked Guan Yu."
秦琪大怒，縱馬提刀，直取關公。二馬相交，只一合，關公刀起，秦琪頭落。關公曰：「當吾者已死，餘人不必驚走。速備船隻，送我渡河。」軍士急撐舟傍岸。關公請二嫂上船渡河。渡過黃河，便是袁紹地方。關公所歷關隘五處，斬將六員。後人有詩歎曰：,"Qin Qi grew angry, and he loosed his rein. Sword in hand, he came at a gallop. The two met, but in the first encounter Qin Qi's head was swept off by the terrible green-dragon saber.""He who opposed me is dead! You others need not be afraid,"" cried Guan Yu.""Be quick and prepare me a boat.""The boat was soon at the landing, and the two women stepped on board, followed by Guan Yu. They crossed and were then in the country of Yuan Shao. In the course of his journey to this point, Guan Yu had forced five passes and slain six generals."
掛印封金辭漢相，尋兄遙望遠途還。馬騎赤兔行千里，刀偃青龍出五關。忠義慨然沖，宇宙，英雄從此震江山。獨行斬將應無敵，今古留題翰墨間。,"His seal hung up, the treasury locked, his courtly mansion left,He journeyed toward his brother dear, too long from his side left.The horse he rode was famed for speed as for endurance great,His good sword made a way for him and opened every gate.His loyalty and truth forth stand, a pattern unto all,His valor would frighten rushing streams and make high mountains fall.Alone he traveled lustily, this was death to meet his blade,He has been themed by myriads, his glory never will fade."
關公於馬上自歎曰：「吾非欲沿途殺人，奈事不得已也。曹公知之，必以我為負恩之人矣。」正行間，忽見一騎自北而來，大叫：「雲長少住！」關公勒馬視之，乃孫乾也。關公曰：「自汝南相別，一向消息若何？」,"""I did not willingly slay a single one of them,"" mused Guan Yu as he rode along. ""There was no help for it. Nevertheless when Cao Cao hears of it, he will regard me as ungrateful for his bounty.""Before long he saw a rider on the road who soon hailed him and proved to be Sun Qian.""I have never heard a word from you since we lost sight of each other at Runan. How have you fared?"" said Guan Yu."
乾曰：「劉辟，龔都，自將軍回兵之後，復奪了汝南；遣某往河北結好袁紹，請玄德同謀破曹之計。不想河北將士，各相妒忌。田豐尚囚獄中；沮授黜退不用；審配，郭圖，各自爭權；袁紹多疑，主持不定。某與劉皇叔商議，先求脫身之計。今皇叔已住汝南會合劉辟去了。恐將軍不知，反到袁紹處，或為所害，特遣某於路迎接將來。幸於此得見。將軍可速往汝南與皇叔相會。」,"""After your departure Liu Pi and Gong Du retook the city. I was sent by them to Yuan Shao to try to make peace with him and succeeded, so that Yuan Shao invited Liu Bei to go to him and share in the deliberations for a concerted attack on Cao Cao. But to my disgust the leaders of Yuan Shao's army showed great jealousy of each other so that Tian Feng got into gaol, Ju Shou was degraded, and others quarreled. Then Yuan Shao vacillated and hesitated, so that your brother and I consulted how we might get away from them all. Now the Uncle is at Runan with Liu Pi and, thinking you could not know that and might suffer some harm if you unwillingly went to Yuan Shao, I have come to warn you. It is good fortune to find you like this. Now we can hasten to Runan, and you will meet your brother.""Guan Yu took Sun Qian to make his bow to the ladies, who asked after his adventures, and Sun Qian said, ""Uncle Liu Bei were nearly executed due to Yuan Shao's sudden bursts of anger after the deaths of Yan Liang and Wen Chou. Now, however, he is out of his way and safe at Runan, and you will meet him soon."""
關公教孫乾拜見夫人。夫人問其動靜。孫乾備說：「袁紹二次欲斬皇叔，今幸脫身往汝南去了。夫人可與皇叔到此相會。」二夫人皆掩面垂淚。關公依言，不投河北去，逕取汝南來。,"The ladies covered their faces and wept at the recital of his dangers. Then the party no longer traveled north but took the road toward Runan. Not long after a great cloud of dust was noticed behind them, and that presently made out a hundred of horsemen."
正行之間，背後塵埃起處，一彪人馬趕來。當先夏侯惇大叫「關某休走！」正是：六將阻關徒受死，一軍攔路復爭鋒。畢竟關公怎生脫身，且看下文分解。,"These were led by Xiahou Dun, who shouted out to Guan Yu to stop.One by one the pass commanders stopped his progress and were slain,The river crossed, another army comes and he must fight again.How finally Guan Yu escaped death will appear in the succeeding chapter."
