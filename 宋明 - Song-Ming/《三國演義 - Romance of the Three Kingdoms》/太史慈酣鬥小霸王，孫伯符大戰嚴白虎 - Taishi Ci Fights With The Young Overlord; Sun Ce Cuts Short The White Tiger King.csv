卻說張飛拔劍要自刎，玄德向前抱住，奪劍擲地曰：「古人云：『兄弟如手足，妻子如衣服。衣服破，尚可縫；手足斷，安可續？』吾三人桃園結義，不求同生，但願同死。今雖失了城池家小，安忍教兄弟中道而亡？況城池本非吾有；家眷雖被陷，呂布必不謀害，尚可設計救之。賢弟一時之誤，何至遽欲捐生耶！」說罷大哭。關、張俱感泣。,"In the last chapter it was recorded that Zhang Fei was about to end his life with his own weapon in Xuyi.But Liu Bei rushed forward and caught Zhang Fei in his arms, snatched away the sword, and threw it on the earth.Liu Bei said, ""The ancient had a saying: 'Brothers are as hands and feet; wives and children are as clothing. You may mend your torn dress, but who can reattach a lost limb?' We three, by the Oath of the Peach Garden, swore to seek the same death day. The city is lost, it is true, and my wives and little ones, but I could not bear that we should die ere our course be run. Beside, Xuzhou was not really ours, and Lu Bu will not harm my family but will rather seek to preserve them. You made a mistake, worthy brother, but is it the one deserving of death?""And Liu Bei wept. His brothers were much affected, and their tears fell in sympathy."
且說袁術知呂布襲了徐州，星夜差人至呂布處，許以糧五萬斛，馬五百匹，金銀一萬兩，綵緞一千疋，使夾攻劉備。布喜，令高順領兵五萬襲玄德之後。玄德聞得此信，乘陰雨撤兵，棄盱眙而走，思欲東取廣陵。比及高順軍來，玄德已去。高順與紀靈相見，就索所許之物。靈曰：「公且回軍，容某見主公計之。」高順乃別紀靈回軍，見呂布具述紀靈語。,"As soon as the news of Lu Bu's successful seizure of his protector's region reached Yuan Shu, Yuan Shu sent promises of valuable presents to Lu Bu to induce him to join in a further attack on Liu Bei. The presents are said to have been fifty thousand carts of grain, five hundred horses, ten thousand ounces of gold and silver, and a thousand rolls of colored silk.Lu Bu swallowed the bait and ordered Gao Shun to lead forth fifty thousand troops. But Liu Bei heard of the threatened attack, so he made inclement weather an excuse to moved his few soldiers out of Xuyi for Guangling, before the attacking force came up.However, Gao Shun demanded the promised reward through Ji Ling, who put Gao Shun off, saying, ""My lord has gone away. I will settle this as soon as I can see him and get his decision.""With this answer Gao Shun returned to Lu Bu, who could not decide what to do."
布正在遲疑，忽有袁術書至。書意云：「高順雖來，而劉備未除；且待捉了劉備，那時方以所許之物相送。」布怒罵袁術失信，欲起兵伐之。陳宮曰：「不可。術據壽春，兵多糧廣，不可輕敵。不如請玄德還屯小沛，使為我羽翼。他日令玄德為先鋒，那時先取袁術，後取袁紹，可縱橫天下矣。」布聽其言，令人齎書迎玄德回。,"Then came a letter from Yuan Shu: ""Although Gao Shun had gone to attack Liu Bei, yet Liu Bei had not been destroyed, and no reward could be given till he was actually taken.""Lu Bu railed at what he called the breach of faith and was inclined to attack Yuan Shu himself.However, his adviser, Chen Gong, opposed this course, saying, ""You should not. Yuan Shu is in possession of Shouchun and has a large army, well supplied. You are no match for him. Rather ask Liu Bei to take up his quarters at Xiaopei as one of your wings and, when the time comes, let him lead the attack, both south and north. Then Yuan Shu and Yuan Shao will fall before you, and you will be very powerful.""Finding this advice good, Lu Bu sent letters to Liu Bei asking him to return."
卻說玄德引兵東取廣陵，被袁術劫寨，折兵大半；回來正遇呂布之使，呈上書札，玄德大喜。關、張曰：「呂布乃無義之人，不可信也。」玄德曰：「彼既以好情待我，奈何疑之？」遂來到徐州。布恐玄德疑惑，先令人送還家眷。甘、糜二夫人見玄德，具說呂布令兵把定宅門，禁諸人不得入；又常使侍妾送物，未嘗有缺。玄德謂關、張曰：「我知呂布必不害我家眷也。」乃入城謝呂布。張飛恨呂布，不肯隨往，先奉二嫂往小沛去了。,"After the flight of Liu Bei, Yuan Shu attacked Guangling and reduced Liu Bei's force by half. When the messenger from Lu Bu came, Liu Bei read the letter. He was quite content with the offer, but his brothers were not inclined to trust Lu Bu.""Such a dishonorable man must have a motive,"" said Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.""Since he treats me kindly, I cannot but trust him,"" replied Liu Bei.So Liu Bei went back to Xuzhou. Lu Bu, fearing that Liu Bei might doubt his sincerity, restored Liu Bei's family; and when Lady Gan and Lady Mi saw their lord, they told him that they had been kindly treated and guarded by soldiers against any intrusion, and provisions had never been wanting.""I knew he would not harm my family,"" said Liu Bei to Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.However, Zhang Fei was not pleased and would not accompany his brothers into the city when they went to express their thanks. He went to escort the two ladies to Xiaopei."
玄德入見呂布拜謝。呂布曰：「我非欲奪城；因令弟張飛在此恃酒殺人，恐有失事，故來守之耳。」玄德曰：「備欲讓兄久矣。」布假意仍讓玄德。玄德力辭，還屯小沛住。關、張心中不平。玄德曰：「屈身守分，以待天時，不可與命爭也。」呂布令人送糧米緞疋。自此兩家和好，不在話下。,"At the interview Lu Bu said, ""I did not wish to take the city, but your brother behaved very badly, drinking and flogging the soldiers, and I came to guard it lest some evil should befall.""""But I had long wished to yield it to you,"" said Liu Bei.Thereupon Lu Bu wished to retire in favor of Liu Bei who, however, would not hear of it. Liu Bei returned and took up his quarters in Xiaopei, but his two brothers would not take the situation kindly and were very discontented.Said Liu Bei, ""One must bow to one's lot. It is the will of Heaven, and one cannot struggle against fate.""Lu Bu sent presents of food and stuffs, and peace reigned between the two houses."
卻說袁術大宴將士於壽春。人報孫策征廬江太守陸康，得勝而回。術喚策至，策拜於堂下。問勞已畢，便令侍坐飲宴。原來孫策自父喪之後，退居江南，禮賢下士，後因陶謙與策母舅丹陽太守吳璟不和，策乃移母并家屬居於曲阿，自己卻投袁術。術甚愛之，常歎曰：「使術有子如孫郎，死復何恨！」因使為懷義校尉，引兵攻涇縣，太師祖郎得勝。術見策勇，復使攻陸康，今又得勝而回。,"In Shouchun, Yuan Shu prepared a great banquet for his soldiers when it was announced that Sun Ce had subdued Lu Gang, the Governor of Lujiang. Yuan Shu summoned the victor, who made obeisance at the foot of the hall of audience. Yuan Shu, sitting in state, asked for details of the campaign and then invited Sun Ce to the banquet.After the unhappy death of his father Sun Jian, Sun Ce had returned to the lower region of the Great River, where he had devoted himself to peaceful ends, inviting to his side good people and able scholars. Afterwards, when a quarrel broke out between his mother's brother, Governor Wu Jing of Dangyang, and the late Imperial Protector of Xuzhou, Tao Qian, Sun Ce removed his mother with all the family to Que, he himself taking service under Yuan Shu, who admired and loved him greatly.""If I had a son like Sun Ce,"" said Yuan Shu, ""I should die without regret.""Yuan Shu appointed Sun Ce Commander and sent him on various expeditions, all of which were successful. A banquet was held to celebrate his victory over Lu Kang."
當日筵散，策歸營寨。見術席間相待之禮甚傲，心中鬱悶，乃步月於中庭。因思父孫堅如此英雄，我今淪落至，此不覺於聲大哭。忽見一人自外而入，大笑曰：「伯符何故如此？尊父在日，多曾用我。君若有不決之事，何不問我，乃自哭耶？」策視之，乃丹陽故鄣人：姓朱，名治，字君理；孫堅舊從事官也。策收淚而延之坐曰：「策所哭者，恨不能繼父之志耳。」治曰：「君何不告袁公路，借兵往江東，假名救吳璟，實圖大業，而乃久困於人之下乎？」,"Sun Ce returned to his camp very bitter over the arrogant and patronizing airs of his patron. Instead of retiring to his tent, Sun Ce walked up and down by the light of the moon.""Here am I, a mere nobody, and yet my father was such a hero!""And he cried out and wept in spite of himself.Then suddenly appeared one who said, laughing loudly, ""What is this, Sun Ce? While your noble father enjoyed the light of the sun, he made free use of me. If his son has any difficulty to resolve, why does he not refer it to me also instead of weeping here alone?""Looking at the speaker Sun Ce saw it was Zhu Zhi, a native of Dangyang, who had been in Sun Jian's service. Sun Ce then ceased weeping, and they two sat down.""I was weeping from regret at being unable to continue my father's work,"" said Sun Ce.""Why stay here bound to the service of a master? The Governor of Dangyang is in distress. Why not get command of an army under the pretense of an expedition to relieve Wu Jing? Escape the shadow of Yuan Shu and take control of Dangyang, then you can accomplish great things."""
正商議間，一人忽入曰：「公等所謀，吾已知之。吾手下有精壯百人，暫助伯符一臂之力。」策視其人，乃袁術謀士，汝南細陽人：姓呂，名範，字子衡。策大喜，延坐共議。呂範曰：「只怕袁公路不肯借兵。」策曰：「吾有亡父留下傳國玉璽，以為質當。」範曰：「公路欲得此久矣！以此相質，必肯發兵。」,"While these two were talking, another man suddenly entered, saying, ""I know what you two are planning, Noble Sirs. Under my hand is a band of one hundred bold fellows ready to help Sun Ce in whatever he wishes to do.""The speaker was one of Yuan Shu's advisers named Lu Fan, from Runan. They three then sat and discussed schemes.""The one fear is that Yuan Shu will refuse to give you the troops,"" said Lu Fan.""I still have the Imperial Hereditary Seal that my father left me: That should be good security.""""Yuan Shu earnestly desires that jewel,"" said Zhu Zhi. ""He will certainly lend you troops on that pledge."""
三人計議已定。次日，策入見袁術，哭拜曰：「父讎不能報，今母舅吳璟，又為揚州刺史劉繇所逼；策老母家小，皆在曲阿，必將被害；策敢借雄兵數千，渡江救難省親。恐明公不信，有亡父遺下玉璽，權為質當。」術聞有玉璽，取而視之，大喜曰：「吾非要你玉璽，今且權留在此。我借兵三千、馬五百匹與你。平定之後，可速回來。你職位卑微，難掌大權。我表你為折衝校尉殄寇將軍，剋日領兵便行。」,"The three talked over their plans, gradually settling the details. Not many days after Sun Ce obtained an interview with his patron.Assuming the appearance of deep grief Sun Ce said, ""I have been unable to avenge my father. Now the Imperial Protector of Yangzhou, Liu Yao, is opposing my mother's brother, and my mother and her family are in danger in Que. Wherefore I would borrow a few thousands of fighting men to rescue them. As perhaps, Illustrious Sir, you may lack confidence in me, I am willing to deposit the Imperial Hereditary Seal, left me by my late father, as a pledge.""""Let me see it if you have it,"" said Yuan Shu. ""I do not want the jewel really, but you may as well leave it with me. I will lend you three thousand troops and five hundred horses. Return as soon as peace can be made. As your rank is hardly sufficient for such powers, I will memorialize to obtain for you higher rank with the title of General Who Exterminates Brigands, and you can soon start."""
策拜謝，遂引軍馬，帶領朱治，呂範，舊將程普，黃蓋，韓當等，擇日起兵。行至歷陽，見一軍到。當先一人：姿質風流，儀容秀麗；見了孫策，下馬便拜。策視其人，乃廬江舒城人：姓周，名瑜，字公瑾。原來孫堅討董卓之時，移家舒城，瑜與孫策同年，交情甚密，因結為昆仲。策長瑜兩月，瑜以兄事策。瑜叔周尚，為丹陽太守，今往省親，到此與策相遇。,"Sun Ce thanked his patron most humbly and soon put the army in motion, taking with him his two new advisers and his father's generals —-Zhu Zhi, Lu Fan, Cheng Pu, Huang Gai, Han Dang, and others.When Sun Ce reached Linyang, he saw a body of troops in front of him, at their head a dashing leader of handsome and refined mien. As soon as this commander saw Sun Ce, he dismounted and made obeisance. It was Zhou Yu from Shucheng.When Sun Jian was opposing the tyrant Dong Zhuo, he moved his family to Shucheng where the Zhou family had lived. And as Zhou Yu and Sun Ce were of the same age all but two months, they became exceedingly good friends and sworn brothers, Sun Ce being the elder in virtue of his two months' seniority. Zhou Yu was on his way to visit Sun Ce's uncle, Governor Wu Jing of Dangyang, when the happy meeting took place."
策見瑜大喜，訴以衷情。瑜曰：「某願施犬馬之力，共圖大事。」策喜曰：「吾得公瑾，大事諧矣。」便令與朱治，呂範等相見。瑜謂策曰：「吾兄欲濟大事，亦知江東有二張乎？」策曰：「何為『二張』？」瑜曰：「一人乃彭城張昭，字子布；一人乃廣陵張紘，字子綱：二人皆有經天緯地之才，因避亂隱居於此。吾兄何不聘之？」策喜，即便令人齎禮往聘，俱辭不至。策乃親到其家，與語大悅，力聘之，二人許允。策遂拜張昭為長史，兼撫軍中郎將；張紘為參謀正議校尉；商議攻擊劉繇。,"Naturally Sun Ce confided his projects and inmost ideas to his friend, who at once said, ""I shall put my whole life and energy to serve you to reach that grand goal.""""Now that you have come, the design is as good as accomplished,"" said Sun Ce.Zhou Yu was introduced to Zhu Zhi and Lu Fan.Zhou Yu said, ""Do you know of the two Zhangs of Guangling? They would be most useful people in working out your schemes.""""Who are they, the two Zhangs?"" said Sun Ce.""They are men of transcendent genius who are living near here for the sake of tranquillity in these turbulent times. Their names are Zhang Zhao and Zhang Hong. Why not invite them to help you, brother?""Sun Ce lost no time in sending letters and gifts, but they both declined. Then he visited them in person, was greatly pleased with their speech and by dint of large gifts and much persuasion, got them to promise to join him. Sun Ce appointed them both Counselors and Generals. The plan of the attack upon Yangzhou Region was the next matter for discussion."
卻說劉繇字正禮，東萊牟平人也，亦是漢室宗親，太尉劉寵之姪，兗州刺史劉岱之弟；舊為揚州刺史，屯於壽春，被袁術趕過江東，故來曲阿。當下聞孫策兵至，急聚眾將商議。部將張英曰：「某領一軍屯於牛渚，縱有百萬之兵，亦不能近。」言未畢，帳下一人高叫曰：「某願為前部先鋒。」眾視之，乃東萊黃縣人太史慈也。慈自解了北海之圍後，便來見劉繇，繇留於帳下。當日聽得孫策來到，願為前部先鋒。繇曰：「你年尚輕，未可為大將，只在吾左右聽命。」太史慈不喜而退。,"The Imperial Protector, Liu Yao, was of Donglai, a scion of the imperial family and brother of the Imperial Protector of Yanzhou, Liu Dai. Liu Yao had long ruled in Yangzhou and headquartered in Shouchun. But Yuan Shu had forced him to flee to the southeast of the Great River. He retired to Que and now was battling with Wu Jing in Linyang.Hearing of the meditated attack on him, Liu Yao summoned his generals to take counsel.Said General Zhang Ying, ""I will take an army and entrench at Niuzhu. No army can get past that, whatever its strength.""Zhang Ying was interrupted by another who shouted, ""And let me lead the van!""All eyes turned to this man. It was Taishi Ci who, after helping Kong Rong raise the siege of Beihai, had come to serve Liu Yao.Hearing him offer to undertake the hazardous post of van leader, Liu Yao said, ""But you are still young and not yet equal to such a charge. Rather stay by my side and await my orders.""Taishi Ci withdrew in disappointment."
張英領兵至牛渚，積糧十萬於邸閣。孫策引兵到，張英出迎。兩軍會於牛渚灘上。孫策出馬，張英大罵，黃蓋便出與張英戰。不數合，忽然張英軍中大亂，報說寨中有人放火。張英急回軍，孫策引軍前來，乘勢掩殺。張英棄了牛渚，望深山而逃。,"Soon Zhang Ying led his army to Niuzhu, where the stores of grain located. When Sun Ce approached, Zhang Ying went to meet him, and the two armies faced each other above the Bullock Rapid. Zhang Ying roundly abused his opponent, and Huang Gai rode out to attack him. But before the combat had proceeded far, there arose an alarm of fire in Zhang Ying's camp. Zhang Ying turned back, and then Sun Ce advanced in full force, compelling the enemy to abandon their possession. The defeated general fled to the hills."
原來那寨後放火的，乃是兩員健將：一人乃九江壽春人，姓蔣，名欽，字公奕；一人乃九江下蔡人，姓周，名泰，字幼平。二人皆遭世亂，聚人在揚子江中，劫掠為生；久聞孫策為江東豪傑，能招賢納士，故特引其黨三百餘人，前來相投。策大喜，用為車前校尉，收得牛渚邸閣糧食、軍器，并降卒四千餘人，遂進兵神亭。,"Now the incendiaries who had brought about this result were two, named Jiang Qin from Shouchun and Zhou Tai from Jiujiang, who in these turbulent times had got together a band of kindred spirits and lived by plundering the country along the Great River. They knew Sun Ce by reputation as a man who treated able people very liberally and wished to join him. So they came with their band, three hundred strong, and helped him in this way as an introduction. Sun Ce welcomed them and gave the leaders rank. After taking possession of the stores of all kinds abandoned by the runaways, and enlisting four thousand of those who surrendered into his own ranks, Sun Ce moved forward to attack Shenting."
卻說張英敗回見劉繇，繇怒欲斬之。謀士笮融，薛禮勸免，使屯兵零陵城拒敵。繇自領兵於神亭嶺南下營，孫策於嶺北下營。策問土人曰：「近山有漢光武廟否？」土人曰：「有廟在嶺上。」策曰：「吾夜夢光武召我相見，當往祈之。」長史張昭曰：「不可：嶺南乃劉繇寨，倘有伏兵，奈何？」策曰：「神人佑我，吾何懼焉？」遂披挂綽鎗上馬，引程普，黃蓋，韓當，蔣欽，周泰等共十三騎，出寨上嶺，到廟焚香。下馬參拜已畢，策向前跪祝曰：「若孫策能於江東立業，復興故父之基，即當重修廟宇，四時祭祀。」,"After his defeat Zhang Ying returned to his master and told his misfortune. Liu Yao was going to punish his failure by death, but listened to his advisers, who asked for mercy for the unfortunate man, and sent him to command the garrison in Lingling. Liu Yao himself set out to meet the invaders. He camped south of the Sacred Hills. Sun Ce camped on the opposite side of the hills.Sun Ce inquired the natives, ""Is there a temple of Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter Han in the vicinity?""They said, ""There is a temple to the south on the summit of the hills.""""I dreamed last night that Liu Xiu called me, so I will go and pray there,"" said Sun Ce.But Counselor Zhang Zhao advised, ""My lord, you should not go as the enemy is on the other side, and you may fall into an ambush.""""The spirit will help me: What need I fear?""So Sun Ce put on his armor, took his spear and mounted, taking with him twelve of his commanders as an escort. They rode up the hills, dismounted, burned incense, and they all bowed in the shrine.Then Sun Ce knelt and made a vow, saying, ""If I, Sun Ce, succeed in my task and restore the authority of my late father, then will I restore this temple and order sacrifices at the four seasons."""
祝畢，出廟上馬，回顧眾將曰：「吾欲過嶺，探看劉繇寨柵。」諸將皆以為不可。策不從，遂同上嶺，南望村林。早有伏路小軍飛報劉繇。繇曰：「此必是孫策誘敵之計，不可追之。」太史慈踴躍曰：「此時不捉孫策，更待何時？」遂不候劉繇將令，竟自披挂上馬，綽鎗出營，大叫曰：「有膽氣者，都跟我來！」諸將不動。惟有一小將曰：「太史慈真猛將也！吾可助之！」拍馬同行。眾將皆笑。,"When they had remounted, Sun Ce said, ""I am going to ride along the ridge and reconnoiter the enemy's position.""His commanders begged him to refrain, but he was obstinate, and they rode there together, noting the villages below.A soldier of the other side going along a bye road quickly reported the presence of horsemen on the ridge, and Liu Yao said, ""It is certainly Sun Ce trying to inveigle us to battle. But do not go out.""Taishi Ci jumped up, saying, ""What better chance to capture him?""So, without orders he armed himself and rode through the camp, crying, ""If there be any valiant men among you, follow me!""No one moved save a low-ranking commander who said, ""He is a brave man, and I will go with him.""So he also went. The others only laughed at the pair."
卻說孫策看了半晌，方始回馬。正行過嶺，只聽得嶺上叫：「孫策休走！」策回頭視之，見兩匹馬飛下嶺來。策將十三騎一齊擺開。策橫鎗立馬於嶺下待之。太史慈高叫曰：「那個是孫策？」策曰：「你是何人？」答曰：「我便是東萊太史慈也，特來捉孫策！」策笑曰：「只我便是。你兩個一齊來併我一個，我不懼你！我若怕你，非孫伯符也！」慈曰：「你便眾人都來，我亦不怕！」縱馬橫鎗，直取孫策。策挺鎗來迎。兩馬相交，戰五十合，不分勝負，程普等暗暗稱奇。,"Now having seen all he wished, Sun Ce thought it time to return and wheeled round his horse. But when he was going over the summit, someone shouted, ""Stay, Sun Ce!""Sun Ce turned. Two horsemen were coming at full speed down the next hill. Sun Ce halted and drew up his little escort right and left, he himself with his spear ready.""Which is Sun Ce?"" shouted Taishi Ci.""Who are you?"" was the reply.""I, Taishi Ci of Laihuang, come to take him prisoner!""""Then I am he!"" said Sun Ce, laughing. ""Come both of you together. I am not afraid of you. If I were, I should not be Sun Ce!""""You and all your crowd come on, and I will not blench!"" cried Taishi Ci putting his horse at a gallop and setting his spear.Sun Ce braced himself for the shock, and the battle began. Fifty bouts were fought and still neither combatant had the advantage. Sun Ce's commanders whispered to each other their admiration and amazement."
慈見孫策鎗法無半點兒滲漏，乃佯輸詐敗，引孫策趕來。慈卻不由舊路上嶺，竟轉過山背後。策趕到，大喝曰：「走的不算好漢！」慈心中自忖：「這廝有十二從人，我只一個，便活捉了他，也被眾人奪去。再引一程，教這廝沒尋處，方好下手。」於是且戰且走。策那裏肯捨，一直趕到平川之地。慈兜回馬再戰，又到五十合。策一鎗搠去，慈閃過，挾住鎗；慈也一鎗搠去，策亦閃過，挾住鎗。兩個用力只一拖，都滾下馬來。馬不知走的那裏去了。兩個棄了鎗，揪住廝打，戰袍扯得粉碎。策手快，掣了太史慈背上的短戟，慈亦掣了策頭上的兜鍪。策把戟來刺慈，慈把兜鍪遮架。,"Taishi Ci saw that the spearmanship of his opponent showed no weak point whereby he could gain the advantage, so he decided to resort to guile. Feigning defeat he would lead Sun Ce to pursue. Taishi Ci however did not retire along the road by which he had come, but took a path leading around the hill instead of over it.His antagonist followed, shouting, ""He who retreats is no worthy soldier!""But Taishi Ci thought within himself, ""He has twelve others at his back and I only one. If I capture him, the others will retake him. I will inveigle him into some secret spot and then try.""So flying and fighting by turns he led Sun Ce, an eager pursuer, down to the plain. Here Taishi Ci suddenly wheeled about and attacked. Again they exchanged half a hundred bouts, without result. Then Sun Ce made a fierce thrust, which his opponent evaded by gripping the spear under his arm, while he himself did the same with his opponent's spear. Neither was wounded but each exerting his utmost strength to pull the other out of the saddle, and they both came to the ground.Their steeds galloped off they knew not whither, while the two men, each dropping his spear, began a hand to hand struggle. Soon their fighting robes were in tatters. Sun Ce gripped the short lance that Taishi Ci carried at his back, while Taishi Ci tore off Sun Ce's helmet. Sun Ce tried to stab with the short lance but Taishi Ci fended off the blow with the helmet as a shield."
忽然喊聲後起，乃劉繇接應軍到來，約有千餘。策正慌急，程普等十二騎亦衝到，策與慈方纔放手。慈於軍中討了一匹馬，取了鎗，上馬復來。孫策的馬，卻是程普收得，策亦取鎗上馬。劉繇一千餘軍，和程普等十二騎混戰，逶迤殺到神亭嶺下。喊聲起處，周瑜領軍來到。劉繇自引大軍殺下嶺來。時近黃昏，風雨暴至，兩下各自收軍。,"Then arose a great shouting. Liu Yao had come up with a thousand soldiers. Sun Ce seemed now in sore straits. His twelve followers came up, and each combatant let go his hold. Taishi Ci quickly found another steed, seized a spear, and mounted. Sun Ce, whose horse had been caught by Cheng Pu, also mounted, and a confused battle began between the handful of men on one side and a whole thousand troops on the other. It swayed and drifted down the hill side. However, soon Zhou Yu leading his troops came to the rescue, and as evening drew on a tempest put an end to the fight. Both sides drew off and returned to camp."
次日，孫策引軍到劉繇營前，劉繇引軍出迎。兩陣圓處，孫策把鎗挑太史慈的小戟於陣前，令軍士大叫曰：「太史慈若不是走的快，已被刺死了！」太史慈亦將孫策兜鍪挑於陣前，也令軍士大叫曰：「孫策頭已在此！」,"Next day Sun Ce led his army to the front of Liu Yao's camp, and the challenge was accepted. The armies were drawn up.Sun Ce hung the short lance he had seized from Taishi Ci at the end of his spear, waved it in front of the line of battle, and ordered his soldiers to shout, ""If the owner of this had not fled, he would have been stabbed to death!""On the other side they hung out Sun Ce's helmet, and the soldiers shouted back, ""Sun Ce's head is here already!"""
兩軍吶喊，這邊誇勝，那邊道強。太史慈出馬，要與孫策決個勝負，策遂欲出。程普曰：「不須主公勞力，某自擒之。」程普出到陣前，太史慈曰：「你非我之敵手，只教孫策出馬來！」程普大怒，挺鎗直取太史慈。兩馬相交，戰到三十合，劉繇急鳴金收軍。太史慈曰：「我正要捉拿賊將，何故收軍？」劉繇曰：「人報周瑜領軍襲取曲阿，有廬江松滋人陳武，字子烈，接應周瑜入去。吾家基業已失，不可久留。速往秣陵，會薛禮，笮融軍馬，急來接應。」,"Both sides thus yelled defiance at each other, one side boasting, the other bragging. Then Taishi Ci rode out challenging Sun Ce to a duel to the death, and Sun Ce would have accepted.But Cheng Pu said, ""My lord should not trouble himself. I will take him.""And Cheng Pu rode forth.""You are no antagonist for me,"" said Taishi Ci. ""Tell your master to come out!""This incensed Cheng Pu, who rode at his opponent, and they two fought thirty bouts. The duel was stopped by the gongs of Liu Yao.""Why did you sound the retreat?"" said Taishi Ci. ""I was just going to capture the wretch.""""Because I have just heard that Que has been captured. Zhou Yu led a surprise force thither, and Chen Wu was in league with him to betray the city. We have no home now. I will hasten to Moling to get the help of Xue Li and Ze Rong to retake the city."""
太史慈跟著劉繇退軍，孫策不趕，收住人馬。長史張昭曰：「彼軍被周瑜襲取曲阿，無戀戰之心，今夜正好劫營。」孫策然之，當夜分軍五路，長驅大進。劉繇軍兵大敗，眾皆四紛五落。太史慈獨力難當，引十數騎連夜投涇縣去了。,"The army retired, Taishi Ci with it, without being pursued.On the other side Zhang Zhao said to Sun Ce, ""Zhou Yu's attack is the cause of this move; they are in no mood to fight. A night raid on their camp would finish them.""The army was divided into five divisions for the night surprise and hastened toward the camp where they scored a victory. Their opponents scattered in all directions. Taishi Ci alone made a determined stand, and as he could not withstand a whole army, he fled with ten horsemen to Jingxian."
卻說孫策又得陳武為輔：其人身長七尺，面黃睛赤，形容古怪。策甚敬愛之，拜為校尉，使作先鋒，攻薛禮。武引十數騎突入陣去，斬首級五十餘顆。薛禮閉門不敢出。,"Now Sun Ce acquired a new adherent in the person of Chen Wu. He was a fighter of seven-span height, sallow of complexion and red eye, an odd looking man. But Sun Ce held him in high esteem, appointed him Commander, and put him in the van of the attack on Xue Li. As Van Leader, Chen Wu and a dozen horsemen made a dash into the enemy's formation, where they slew half a hundred men. So Xue Li would not fight but remained within his defenses."
策正攻城，忽有人報劉繇會合笮融去取牛渚。孫策大怒，自提大軍竟奔牛渚。劉繇，笮融二人出馬迎敵。孫策曰：「吾今到此，你如何不降？」劉繇背後一人挺鎗出馬，乃部將于糜也；與策戰不三合，被策生擒過去，撥馬回陣。繇將樊能，見捉了于糜，挺鎗來趕。那鎗剛搠到策後心，策陣上軍士大叫：「背後有人暗萛！」策回頭，忽見樊能馬到，乃大喝一聲，聲如巨雷。樊能驚駭，倒翻身撞下馬來，破頭而死。策到門旗下將于糜丟下，已被挾死。一霎時挾死一將，喝死一將；自此，人皆呼孫策為「小霸王」。,"When Sun Ce was attacking the city, a spy came in with the news that Liu Yao and Ze Rong had gone to attack Niuzhu, which made Sun Ce move thither in haste. His two opponents were ready for battle.""I am here!"" said Sun Ce, ""You had better give in!""A general came out from behind Liu Yao to accept the challenge. It was Yu Mi. But in the third bout Sun Ce made him prisoner and carried him off to the other side. Seeing his colleague thus captured, Fan Neng rode out to the rescue and got quite close. But just as he was going to thrust, all Sun Ce's soldiers shouted, ""There is a man behind you going to strike secretly!""At this Sun Ce turned and shouted so thunderously loud that Fan Neng fell out of his saddle from mere fright. He split his skull and died. When Sun Ce reached his standard, he threw his prisoner to the ground. And Yu Mi was also dead, crushed to death between the arm and the body of his captor. So in a few moments Sun Ce had disposed of two enemies, one crushed to death and one frightened to death. Thereafter Sun Ce was called the Young Overlord."
當日劉繇兵大敗，人馬大半降策。策斬首萬餘。劉繇與笮融走豫章投劉表去了。孫策還兵復攻秣陵，親到城壕邊，招諭薛禮投降。城上暗放一冷箭，正中孫策左腿，翻身落馬。眾將急救起，還營拔箭，以金瘡藥傅之。策令軍中詐稱主將中箭身死。軍中舉哀，拔寨齊起。,"Liu Yao had a defeat. The greater portion of his force surrendered, and the number of those slain exceeded ten thousand. Liu Yao himself fled to Yuzhang and sought safety with Liu Biao, Imperial Protector of Jingzhou.An attack on Moling was the next move. As soon as Sun Ce arrived at the moat, he summoned Commander Xue Li to surrender. Someone let fly a furtive arrow from the wall which wounded Sun Ce in the left thigh so severely that he fell from his steed. Hastily his officers picked up their wounded chief and returned to the camp where the arrow was pulled out and the wound dressed with the medicines suitable for injuries by metals.By Sun Ce's command the story was spread abroad that the hurt had been fatal, and all the soldiers set up cries of lamentation. The camp was broken up."
薛禮聽知孫策已死，連夜起城內之軍，與驍將張英，陳橫殺出城來追之。忽然伏兵四起，孫策當先出馬，高聲大叫曰：「孫郎在此！」眾軍皆驚，盡棄鎗刀，拜於地下。策令休殺一人。張英撥馬回走，被陳武一鎗刺死。陳橫被蔣欽一箭射死。薛禮死於亂軍中。策入秣陵，安輯居民；移兵至涇縣來捉太史慈。,"Xue Li, Zhang Ying, and Chen Heng made a night sortie but fell into a carefully prepared ambush. Presently Sun Ce himself appeared on horseback, shouting: ""Sun Ce is here still!""His sudden appearance created such a panic that the soldiers dropped their weapons and fell on their faces. Sun Ce gave orders not to kill them. But their leaders fell: Zhang Ying from Chen Wu's spear thrust as he turned to run away; Chen Heng was killed by Jiang Qin's arrow; and Commander Xue Li was slain in the turbulence. Thus Sun Ce got possession of Moling. Having calmed the people, he sent his soldiers away to Jingxian, where Taishi Ci was in command."
卻說太史慈招得精壯二千餘人，并所部兵，正要來與劉繇報讎。孫策與周瑜商議活捉太史慈之計。瑜令三面攻縣，只留東門放走；離城二十五里，三路各伏一軍，太史慈到那裏，人馬困乏，必然被擒。原來太史慈所招軍大半是山野之民，不諳紀律。涇縣城頭，苦不甚高。夜孫策命陳武短衣持刀，首先爬上城放火。太史慈見城上火起，上馬投東門走，背後孫策引軍趕來。,"Taishi Ci had assembled two thousand recruits in addition to his own troops for the purpose of avenging his master. Sun Ce and Zhou Yu on the other hand consulted how to capture him alive.Zhou Yu planned, ""Attack the city on three sides, leaving the east gate free for flight. Some distance off an ambush shall be prepared, when Taishi Ci, his men fatigued and horses spent, shall fall an easy victim.""The latest recruits under Taishi Ci's banner were mostly hillmen and unaccustomed to discipline. Beside, the walls of the city were pitiably low. One night Sun Ce ordered Chen Wu to strip off his long dress, leave his arms save a dagger, clamber up the ramparts, and set fire to the city. Seeing the flames spreading, Taishi Ci made for the east gate and, as soon as he got outside, Sun Ce followed in pursuit. The pursuit was maintained for some fifteen miles when the pursuers stopped."
太史慈正走，後軍趕至三十里，卻不趕了。太史慈走了五十里，人困馬乏，蘆葦之中，喊聲忽起。慈急待走，兩下裏絆馬索齊來，將馬絆翻了，生擒太史慈，解投大寨。策知解到太史慈，親自出營喝散士卒，自釋其縛，將自己錦袍衣之，請入寨中，謂曰：「吾知子義真丈夫也。劉繇蠢輩，不能用為大將，以致此敗。」,"Taishi Ci went on as long as possible, finally halting to rest in a spot surrounded by reeds. Suddenly a tremendous shouting arose. Taishi Ci was just starting when tripping ropes arose all round, his horse was thrown and he found himself a prisoner.Taishi Ci was taken back to camp. As soon as Sun Ce heard the news, he himself rode out to order the guards to leave the prisoner, whose bonds he loosened with his own hands. Then he took off his own embroidered robe and put it on the captive. They entered the camp together.""I knew you were a real hero,"" said Sun Ce. ""That worm Liu Yao had no use for such as you, and so he got beaten."""
慈見策待之甚厚，遂請降。策執慈手笑曰：「神亭相戰之時，若公獲我，還相害否？」慈笑曰：「未可知也。」策大笑，請入帳，邀之上坐，設宴款待。慈曰：「劉君新破，士卒離心，某欲自往收拾餘眾，以助明公，不識能相信否？」策起謝曰：「此誠策所願也。今與公約：明日日中，望公來還。」慈應諾而去。諸將曰：「太史慈此去必不來矣。」策曰：「子義乃信義之士，必不背我。」眾皆未信。,"Taishi Ci, overcome by this kindness and good treatment, then formally surrendered.Sun Ce seized his hand and said, laughing, ""If you had taken me at that fight we had near the shrine, would you have killed me?""""Who can say?"" said Taishi Ci smiling.Sun Ce laughed also and they entered his tent, where Taishi Ci was placed in the seat of honor at a banquet.Taishi Ci said, ""Can you trust me so far as to let me go to muster as many as I can of the soldiers of my late master? Under the smart of this defeat they will turn against him, and they would be a great help to you.""""Exactly what I most desire. I will make an agreement with you that at midday tomorrow you will return.""Taishi Ci agreed and went off. All the generals said he would never return.""He is trustworthy and will not break his word,"" said the chief.None of the officers believed he would come back."
次日，立竿於營門以候日影。恰將日中，太史慈引一千餘眾到寨。孫策大喜。眾皆服策之知人。於是孫策聚數萬之眾，下江東，安民恤眾，投者無數。江東之民，皆呼策為孫郎。但聞孫郎兵至，皆喪膽而走。及策軍到，並不許一人擄掠，雞犬不驚，人民皆悅，齎牛酒到寨勞軍。策以金帛答之，懽聲遍野。其劉繇舊軍願從軍者聽從，不願為軍者給賞歸農。江南之民，無不仰頌。由是兵勢大盛。策乃迎母叔諸弟俱歸曲阿，使弟孫權與周泰守宣城。策領兵南取吳郡。,"But the next day they set up a bamboo rod in the gate of the camp, and just as the shadow marked noon Taishi Ci returned, bringing with him about a thousand troops. Sun Ce was pleased, and his officers had to confess that he had rightly judged his man.Sun Ce thus marched his army to the South Land, and his enemies fled or surrendered before his force. He had now several legions and the southeast of the Great River was his. He improved the conditions of the people and maintained order so that his adherents and supporters daily increased. He was called Sun Ce the Bright.When Sun Ce's army approached, the people used to flee in terror; but when it had arrived and they saw that no one was permitted to loot and not the least attempt was made on their houses, they rejoiced and presented the soldiers with oxen and wine, for which they were in turn duly rewarded. Gladness filled the country side. The soldiers who had followed Liu Yao were kindly treated. Those who wished to join Sun Ce's army did so; those who preferred not to be soldiers were sent home with presents. And thus Sun Ce won the respect and praise of everyone and became very powerful.Sun Ce then settled his mother and the remainder of the family in Que, setting his brother, Sun Quan, and Zhou Tai over the city of Xuancheng. Then he headed an expedition to the south to reduce Wujun."
時有嚴白虎，自稱東吳德王據吳郡，遣部將守住烏程、嘉興。當日白虎聞策兵至，令弟嚴輿出兵，會於楓橋。輿橫刀立馬於橋上。有人報入中軍，策便欲出。張紘諫曰：「夫主將乃三軍之所繫命，不宜輕敵小寇。願將軍自重。」策謝曰：「先生之言如金石；但恐不親冒矢石，則將士不用命耳。」遂遣韓當出馬。,"At that time there was a certain Yan Baihu, or the White Tiger, who styled himself King of East Wu and ruled over Wujun. His armies stationed at Wucheng and Jiaxing. Hearing of Sun Ce's approach, Yan Baihu sent his brother, Yan Yu, with an army against Sun Ce, and they met at Maple Bridge.Yan Yu, sword in hand, took his stand on the bridge, and this was reported to Sun Ce, who prepared to accept the challenge.Zhang Hong tried to dissuade him, saying, ""For as much as my lord's fate is bound up with that of the army, he should not risk a conflict with a mere robber. I wish that you should remember your own value.""""Your words, O Wise One, are as gold and precious stones, but I fear that my soldiers will not carry out my commands unless I myself share their dangers."" However, Sun Ce sent forth Han Dang to take up the challenge."
比及韓當到橋上時，蔣欽，陳武早駕小舟從河岸邊殺過橋來，亂箭射倒岸上軍，二人飛身上岸砍殺，嚴輿退走。韓當引軍直殺到閶門下，賊退入城裏去了。策分兵水陸並進，圍住吳城。一困三日，無人出戰。策引眾軍到閶門外招諭，城上一員裨將，左手托定護梁，右手指著城下大罵。太史慈就馬上拈弓取箭，顧軍將曰：「看我射中這廝左手！」,"Just as Han Dang reached the bridge, Jiang Qin and Chen Wu, who had dropped down the river in a small boat, passed under the bridge. Though the arrows fell in clouds on the bank, the two men rushed up and fiercely attacked Yan Yu as he stood on the bridge. Yan Yu fled and Han Dang went in pursuit. But Yan Yu smote up to the west gate of the city into which he entered.Sun Ce laid siege to Wujun both by land and water. For three days no one came out to offer battle. Then at the head of his army, Sun Ce came to the west gate and summoned the warden. An officer of inconsiderable rank came out and stood with one hand resting on a beam while with the other he gave point to his abuse of those below. Quickly Taishi Ci's hands sought his bow and an arrow was on the string.""See me hit that fellow's hand,"" said he, turning to his companions."
說聲未絕，弓弦響處，果然射個正中，把那將的左手射透，反牢釘在護梁上。城上城下見者，無不喝采。,"Even as the sound of his voice died away, the bowstring twanged, the arrow sped and lodged in the beam, firmly pinning thereto the officer's hand. Both sides, those on the wall and those below it, marveled and acclaimed at such marksmanship."
眾人救這人下城。白虎大驚曰：「彼軍有如此人，安能敵乎！」遂商量求和。次日，使嚴輿出城，來見孫策。策請輿入帳飲酒。酒酣，問輿曰：「令兄意欲如何？」輿曰：「欲與將軍平分江東。」策大怒曰：「鼠輩安敢與吾相等！」命斬嚴輿。輿拔劍起身，策飛劍砍之，應手而倒，割下首級，令送入城中。白虎料敵不過，棄城而走。,"The wounded man was taken away.When Yan Baihu the White Tiger heard of the exploit, he said, ""How can we hope to withstand an army with such leaders as this in it?""And his thoughts turned toward a peace. He sent his brother Yan Yu out to see Sun Ce, who received him civilly, invited him into the tent, and set wine before him.""And what does your brother propose?"" said Sun Ce.""He is willing to share this region with you,"" was the reply.""The rat! How dare he put himself on a level with me?"" cried Sun Ce.Sun Ce commanded to put the messenger to death. Yan Yu started up and drew his sword; but out flew Sun Ce's blade, and the unhappy messenger fell to the ground. His head was hacked off and sent into the city to his brother.This had its effect. Yan Baihu saw resistance was hopeless, so he abandoned Wujun and fled."
策進兵追襲，黃蓋攻取嘉興，太史慈攻取烏程，數州皆平。白虎奔餘杭，於路劫掠，被土人凌操領鄉人殺敗，望會稽而走。凌操父子二人來接孫策，策使為從征校尉，遂同引兵渡江。嚴白虎聚寇，分布於西津渡口。程普與戰，復大敗之，連夜趕到會稽。,"Sun Ce pressed the attack. Huang Gai captured Jiaxing, and Taishi Ci took Wucheng. Several other southern cities were fallen. The territory was quickly subdued. Yan Baihu rushed off toward Yuhang in the east, plundering on all sides, till a band of villagers under the leadership of one Ling Cao checked his career of robbery there. Yan Baihu then fled toward Kuaiji.Ling Cao and his son then went to meet Sun Ce, who took them into his service, and appointed them Commanders as a reward for their service, and the joint forces crossed the Great River.The White Tiger, Yan Baihu, gathered his scattered forces and took up a position at Western Ford, but Cheng Pu attacked him there and scattered the defenders, chasing them as far as Kuaiji."
會稽太守王朗，欲引兵救白虎。忽一人出曰：「不可。孫策用仁義之師，白虎乃暴虐之眾，還宜擒白虎以獻孫策。」朗視之，乃會稽餘姚人：姓虞，名翻，字仲翔，見為郡吏。朗怒叱之，翻長歎而出。朗遂引兵會合白虎，同陳兵於山陰之野。兩陣對圓，孫策出馬，謂王朗曰：「吾興仁義之兵，來安浙江，汝何故助賊？」朗罵曰：「汝貪心不足？既得吳郡，而又強併吾界！今日特與嚴氏報讎！」,"The Governor of the place, Wang Lang, was on Yan Baihu's side and inclined to support him actively.But, when Wang Lang proposed this, one of his officers stood forth, saying, ""No! No! Sun Ce as a leader is humane and upright, while the White Tiger is a savage ruffian. Rather capture him and offer his person as a peace offering to Sun Ce.""The Governor turned angrily toward the speaker, who was an official named Yu Fan from Kuaiji, and bade him be silent. Yu Fan withdrew sighing deeply. And the Governor went to the help of the White Tiger with whom he joined forces at Shanyin.Sun Ce came up. When both sides were arrayed, Sun Ce rode out and addressed Wang Lang, saying, ""Mine is an army of good soldiers, and my aim is to restore peace to this region, but you give your support to a rebel!""Wang Lang replied, ""Your greed is insatiable. Having got possession of Wujun, you want also my territory. I shall revenge for the Yans!"""
孫策大怒，正待交戰，太史慈早出。王朗拍馬舞刀，與慈戰。不數合朗將周昕，殺出助戰；孫策陣中黃蓋，飛馬接住周昕交鋒。兩下鼓聲大震，互相鏖戰。忽王朗陣後先亂，一彪軍從背後抄來。朗大驚，急回馬來迎：原來是周瑜與程普引軍刺斜殺來，前後來攻。王朗寡不敵眾，與白虎，周昕，殺條血路，走入城中；拽起弔橋，堅閉城門。,"This response greatly angered Sun Ce. Just as battle was to be joined, Taishi Ci advanced and Wang Lang came toward him waving a sword. Before they had exchanged many passes, Zhou Xin dashed out to help Wang Lang. Thereupon Huang Gai rode out to make the sides more equal. These latter two were just engaging when the drums rolled on both sides, and a general battle began.Suddenly confusion was caused in the rear of Wang Lang's army by the sudden onslaught of a small army. Wang Lang galloped off to see the attackers were Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu. Then an attack was made on his flank, so that he was in a hopeless position, and he and Yan Baihu and Zhou Xin, fighting desperately to cut an alley out, only just managed to reach the shelter of the city. The drawbridges were raised, the gates closed, and preparations made to sustain a siege."
孫策大軍乘勢趕到城下，分布眾軍，四門攻打。王朗在城中見孫策攻城甚急，欲再出兵決一死戰。嚴白虎曰：「孫策兵勢甚大，足下只宜深溝高壘，堅壁勿出。不消一月，彼軍糧盡，自然退走。那時乘虛掩之，可不戰而破也。」朗依其議，乃固守會稽城而不出。,"Sun Ce followed right up to the walls and then divided his troops so as to attack all four gates. Seeing that the city was being fiercely attacked, Wang Lang was for making a sortie, but Yan Baihu opposed this as hopeless against so strong a force outside.""We can only strengthen our position and remain behind the shelter of the ramparts until hunger forces the besiegers to retire,"" said Yan Baihu.Wang Lang agreed, and the siege went on."
孫策一連攻了數日，不能成功，乃與眾將計議。孫靜曰：「王朗負固守城，難可卒拔；會稽錢糧，大半屯於查瀆；其地離此數十里，莫若以兵先據其內：所謂攻其無備，出其不意也。」策大喜曰：「叔父妙用，足破賊人矣！」即下令於各門燃火，虛張旗號，設為疑兵，連夜撤圍南去。周瑜進曰：「主公大兵一起，王朗必然出城來趕，可用奇兵勝之。」策曰：「吾今準備了，取城只在今夜。」遂令軍馬起行。,"For several days a vigorous attack was maintained, but with little success. In a council, Sun Jing, who was the uncle of Sun Ce, said, ""Since they are holding the city with such resolution, it will be difficult to dislodge them. But the bulk of their supplies is stored at Chadu, distant only some ten miles. Our best plan is to seize this place, thus attacking where the enemy is unprepared, and doing what they do not expect.""Sun Ce approved, saying, ""My uncle's plan is admirable and will crush the rebels.""So he issued orders to kindle watch fires at all the gates, and leave the flags standing to maintain the appearance of soldiers in position while the expedition went south.Zhou Yu came to utter a warning, ""When you, my lord, go away, the besieged will surely come out and follow you. We might prepare a surprise for them.""Sun Ce replied, ""My preparations are complete, and the city will be captured tonight."" So the army set out."
卻說王朗聞報孫策軍馬退去，自引眾人來敵樓上觀望；見城下煙火併起，旌旗不雜，心下遲疑。周昕曰：「孫策走矣，特設此計以疑我耳。可出兵襲之。」嚴白虎曰：「孫策此去，莫非要去查瀆。我令部兵與周將軍追之。」朗曰：「查瀆是我屯糧之所，正須隄防。汝引兵先行，吾隨後接應。」白虎與周昕領五千兵出城追趕。將近初更，離城二十餘里，忽密林裏一鼓響，火把齊明。白虎大驚，便勒馬回走。一將當先攔住，火光中視之，乃孫策也。周昕舞刀來迎，被策一鎗刺死。餘眾皆降。白虎殺條血路，望餘杭而走。,"Wang Lang heard that the besiegers had gone, and he went up to the tower to reconnoiter. He saw the fires blazing, the smoke rising, and the pennons fluttering in the breeze as usual and hesitated.Zhou Xin said, ""He has gone and this is only a strategy. Let us go out and smite them.""Yan Baihu said, ""If he has gone, it is to attack Chadu. Let us pursue.""""The place is our base of supply,"" said Wang Lang, ""and must be defended. You two lead the way, and I will follow with reserves.""So Yan Baihu and Zhou Xin went forth with five thousand soldiers and drew near their enemy about the first watch, at seven miles from the city. The road led through dense forest. Then suddenly the drums beat and lighted torches sprang up on all sides. Yan Baihu was frightened, turned his horse and started to retreat. At once a leader appeared in front in whom, by the glare of the torches, he recognized Sun Ce. Zhou Xin made a rush at him but fell under Sun Ce's spear. The men surrendered. However, Yan Baihu managed to cut his way out and fled to Yuhang."
王朗聽知前軍已敗，不敢入城，引部下奔逃海隅去了。孫策復回大軍，乘勢取了城池，安定人民。不隔一日，只見一人將著嚴白虎首級來孫策軍前投獻。策視其人：身長八尺，面方口闊。問其姓名，乃會稽餘姚人：姓董，名襲，字元代。策喜，命為別部司馬。自是東路皆平，令叔孫靜守之，令朱治為吳郡太守，收軍回江東。,"Wang Lang soon heard of the loss and, not daring to return to the city, fled in all haste to the coastal regions. And so Sun Ce got possession of the city of Kuaiji.Having restored order, a few days later a man came bringing the head of the White Tiger as an offering to Sun Ce. This man was a native of the county. He was of eight-span height, with a square face and wide mouth. He was named Dong Xi. Sun Ce appointed him Commander. After this, peace reigned in all the southeast. Sun Ce placed his uncle Sun Jing in command of the city and made Zhu Zhi Governor of Wujun. Then Sun Ce returned to his own place, south of the Great River."
卻說孫權與周泰守宣城，忽山賊竊發，四面殺至。時值更深，不及抵敵，泰抱權上馬。賊用刀來砍。泰赤體步行，提刀殺賊，砍殺十餘人。隨後一賊躍馬挺鎗直取周泰，被泰扯住鎗，拖下馬來，奪了鎗馬，殺條血路，救出孫權。餘賊遠遁。周泰身被十二鎗，金瘡發脹，命在須臾。,"While Sun Ce was absent, a band of brigands suddenly attacked Xuancheng, left in the care of his brother Sun Quan and the leader Zhou Tai. As the onslaught was made on all sides at once, and in the night, the brigands got the upper hand. Zhou Tai took the youth in his arms and mounted a horse; but when the robbers came on with swords to attack him, he dismounted, and though without mail, met the robbers on foot and slew them as they came up. Then came a horseman armed with a spear, but Zhou Tai laid hold of his spear and pulled him to the earth. Next Zhou Tai mounted the robber's horse, and thrusting this way and that with the spear fought his way out. So Sun Quan was preserved, but his savior had received more than a dozen wounds. However, the bandits went away.These wounds being due to metal would not heal but swelled enormously, and the brave soldier's life hung in the balance."
策聞之大驚。帳下董襲曰：「某曾與海寇相持，身遭數鎗，得會稽一個賢郡吏虞翻薦一醫者，半月而愈。」策曰：「虞翻莫非虞仲翔乎？」襲曰：「然。」策曰：「此賢士也，我當用之。」乃令張昭與董襲同往聘請虞翻。翻至，策優禮相待，拜為功曹，因言及求醫之意。翻曰：「此人乃沛國譙郡人：姓華，名佗，字元化。真當世之神醫也。當引之來見。」,"Sun Ce returned and was deeply grieved.Then Dong Xi said, ""Once in an engagement with some coastal pirates, I received many spear wounds, but a certain wise man named Yu Fan recommended a surgeon who cured me in half a month.""""Surely this must be Yu Fan of Kuaiji,"" replied Sun Ce. ""That is he; he is so called.""""Yes, truly a wise man. I would employ him.""So Sun Ce sent two officers to invite Yu Fan, and he came at once. He was treated in most friendly fashion and appointed an official forthwith. Then the question of treating the wounded man was brought up.""The surgeon is one Hua Tuo from Qiao, who has perfectly marvelous medicine skill. I will get him to come,"" said Yu Fan."
不一日引至。策見其人：童顏鶴髮，飄然有出世之姿；乃待為上賓，請視周泰瘡。佗曰：「此易事耳。」投之以藥，一月而愈。策大喜，厚謝華佗。遂進兵殺除山賊。江南皆平。孫策分撥將士，守把各處隘口；一面寫表申奏朝廷；一面結交曹操；一面使人致書與袁術取玉璽。,"Shortly the famous Hua Tuo arrived, a man with the complexion of a youth and a snowy beard. He looked more like a saint who had passed the gates of this life. He was treated very warmly and taken to see the sick general's wounds.""The case is not difficult,"" said the surgeon.And he prepared certain drugs that healed the wounds within a month. Sun Ce suitably acknowledged his care and skill, and he was allowed to leave with rich rewards.Next Sun Ce attacked the brigands and destroyed them, so restoring complete tranquillity to the South Land. After this he set garrisons at all the strategic points in the old state of Wu, and this done, memorialized what he had achieved to the Throne. He came to an understanding with Cao Cao and sent letters to Yuan Shu demanding the return of the Imperial Hereditary Seal he had left in pledge."
卻說袁術暗有稱帝之心，乃回書推託不還；急聚長史楊大將，都督張勳，紀靈，橋蕤，上將雷薄，陳蘭，等三十餘人，商議曰：「孫策借我軍馬起事，今日盡得江東地面，乃不思報本，而反來索璽，殊為無禮。當以何策圖之？」長史楊大將曰：「孫策據長江之險，兵精糧廣，未可圖也。今當先伐劉備，以報前日無故相攻之恨，然後圖取孫策未遲。某獻一計，使備即日就擒。」正是：,"But Yuan Shu, secretly cherishing the most ambitious designs, wrote excuses and did not return the state jewel. In his own place Yuan Shu hastily summoned about thirty of his officers to a council. Among them were Adviser Yang Dajiang and Generals Zhang Xun, Ji Ling, Qiao Rui, Lei Bo, and Chen Lan.Yuan Shu said, ""Sun Ce borrowed an army from me and set out on an expedition which has made him master of the South Land. Now he says nothing of repayment but demands the token of his pledge. Truly he is a boor, and what steps can I take to destroy him?""Yang Dajiang replied, ""You cannot do any thing against him, for he is too strongly placed, the Great River as the shield. You must first remove Liu Bei in revenge for having attacked you without cause, and then you may think about Sun Ce. I have a scheme to put the former into your hands in a very short time."""
不去江東圖虎豹，卻來徐郡鬥蛟龍。不知其計若何，且看下文分解。,"Yuan Shu went not to destroy the tiger, but insteadAgainst a dragon forth his army led.The means Yang Dajiang employed will be made plain in the next chapter."
