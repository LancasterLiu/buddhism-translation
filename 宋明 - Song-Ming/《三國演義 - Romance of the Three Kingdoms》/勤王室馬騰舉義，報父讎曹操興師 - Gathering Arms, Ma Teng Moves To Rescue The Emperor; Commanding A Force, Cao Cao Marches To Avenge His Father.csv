卻說李、郭二賊欲弒獻帝。張濟、樊稠諫曰：「不可。今日若便殺之，恐眾人不服；不如仍舊奉之為主，賺諸侯入關，先去其羽翼，然後殺之，天下可圖也。」李、郭二人從其言，按住兵器。帝在樓上宣諭曰：「王允既誅，軍馬何故不退？」李傕、郭汜曰：「臣等有功王室，未蒙賜爵，故不敢退軍。」帝曰：「卿欲封何爵？」,"In the last chapter the two arch rebels, Li Jue and Guo Si, proposed to murder Emperor Xian, but their followers Zhang Ji and Fan Chou opposed this.""No. The people will not approve of his death now. Restore him to power, and get the leaguers inside Changan's control. Remove his supporters, and then we can compass his death. And the empire shall be in our hands.""So they ceased the attack.The Emperor again spoke from the tower, saying, ""Why do you still remain? You have slain Wang Yun: Now withdraw these soldiers.""Then Li Jue and Guo Si replied, ""Your servants desire rank rewards for their good service to the dynasty.""""And what ranks, Sirs?"""
李、郭、張、樊、四人各自寫職銜獻上，勒要如此官品。帝只得從之，封李傕為車騎將軍池陽侯，領司隸校尉，假節鉞；郭汜為後將軍，假節鉞：同秉朝政；樊稠為右將軍萬年侯；張濟為驃騎將軍平陽侯，領兵屯弘農。其餘李蒙、王方等，各為校尉。然後謝恩，領兵出城。又下令追尋董卓屍首，獲得些零碎皮骨，以香木雕成形體，安湊停當，大設祭祀，用王者衣冠棺槨，選擇吉日，遷葬郿塢。臨葬之期，天降大雷雨，平地水深數尺，霹靂震開其棺，屍首提出棺外。李傕候晴再葬，是夜又復如是。三次改葬，皆不能葬。零皮碎骨，悉為雷火消滅。天之怒卓，可謂甚矣！,"All four - Li, Guo, Zhang, and Fan - wrote their wishes and handed them up to the Emperor who had no choice but to accede to the request, and they were created:Li Jue was appointed General of the Flying Chariots, Lord of Chiyang, Commander of Capital District, Court Administrator, and granted Military Insignia.Guo Si was appointed General of the Rear Army, Lord of Meiyang, Court Administrator, and granted Military Insignia.Fan Chou was appointed General of the Right Army and Lord of Wanian.Zhang Ji was appointed General of the Flying Cavalry and Lord of Pingyan.Li Meng and Wang Fang, for opening the city gates, were appointed Imperial Commanders.After receiving ranks of nobility, Li Jue and Guo Si thanked the Emperor, and went away to camp at Xunung, the suburb of Changan. Other rebel leaders also were gratified with ranks. And once more the capital was free of troops.Dong Zhuo's followers, having so far succeeded, did not forget their late leader. They sought his corpse for burial, but only a few fragments were discoverable. Then they had sculptors engrave a statue of fragrant wood in his likeness, laid that out in proper form, and instituted a noble's sacrifices and prayers. The remains were dressed in the robes of a prince, laid in a princely coffin for burial. They selected Meiwo for his tomb and having found an auspicious day conveyed the coffin thither.But a terrific thunder storm came on at the time of inhumation, and the ground was flooded. The coffin was rived asunder, and the poor remains knocked out by thunders. A second time they buried the coffin, but a similar thing happened in the night. And yet a third time in another place but the earth rejected the remains. Meanwhile the thunder-fire had entirely consumed them. So it may be said justly that Heaven was exceedingly angry with Dong Zhuo."
且說李傕、郭汜既掌大權，殘虐百姓，密遣心腹待帝左右，觀其動靜。獻帝此時舉動荊棘。朝廷官員，並由二賊陞降。因採人望，特宣朱雋入朝，封為太僕，同領朝政。一日，人報西涼太守馬騰、并州刺史韓遂二將引軍十餘萬，殺奔長安來，聲言討賊。原來二將先曾使人入長安，結連侍中馬宇、諫議大夫种邵、左中郎將劉範三人為內應，共謀賊黨。三人密奏獻帝，封馬騰為征西將軍、韓遂為鎮西將軍，各受密詔，併力討賊。,"So now Li Jue and Guo Si wielded the real power of the scepter, and they were hard upon the people. They also removed the attendants from the Palace and replaced them by their own creatures, who maintained a most perfect watch over every movement of the Emperor so that he was greatly hampered and embarrassed. All appointments and demotions were made by the two rebels. For the sake of popularity they especially summoned the veteran general Zhu Jun to court, made him Court Administrator and associated him with the government.One day came a report that the Governor of Xiliang, Ma Teng, and the Imperial Protector of Bingzhou, Han Sui, with one hundred thousand troops, were rapidly approaching the capital with the intention of attacking the rebels in the name of the Emperor.Now these leaders from the west had laid careful plans. Ma Teng and Han Sui had sent trusty friends to the capital to find out who would support them. They had conspired with three officials —-Court Counselors Ma Yu and Chong Shao, and Imperial Commander Liu Fan —-to be their inside allies and plot against the rebels. These three obtained from the Throne two secret edicts conferring the ranks of Commander Who Conquers the West on Ma Teng and Commander Who Guards the West on Han Sui. With these powers the two commanders joined forces and began their march."
當下李傕，郭汜，張濟，樊稠聞二軍將至，一同商議禦敵之策。謀士賈詡曰：「二軍遠來，只宜深溝高壘，堅守以拒之。不過百日，彼兵糧盡，必將自退，然後引兵追之，二將可擒矣。」李蒙、王方出曰：「此非好計。願借精兵萬人，立斬馬騰、韓遂之頭，獻於麾下。」賈詡曰：「今若即戰，必當敗績。」李蒙、王方齊聲曰：「若吾二人敗，情願斬首；吾若戰勝，公亦當輸首級與我。」詡謂李傕、郭汜曰：「長安西二百里盩厔山，其路險崚，可使張、樊兩將軍屯兵於此，堅壁守之；待李蒙、王方自引兵迎敵，可也。」李傕、郭汜從其言，點一萬五千人馬與李蒙、王方。二人忻喜而去，離長安二百八十里下寨。西涼兵到，兩個引軍迎去。西涼軍馬攔路擺開陣勢。馬騰、韓遂聯轡而出，指李蒙、王方罵曰：「反國之賊！誰去擒之？」,"The four leaders of the party in power —-Li Jue, Guo Si, Fan Chou, and Zhang Ji —-held a consultation with their generals as to how to meet the attack.Adviser Jia Xu said, ""Since the attackers are coming from a distance, our plan is to fortify and wait till shortage of food shall work for us. In a hundred days their supplies will be consumed, and they must retire. We can pursue, and we shall capture them.""Li Meng and Wang Fang rose and said, ""This plan is bad. Give us ten thousand troops, and we will put an end to both of them and offer their heads before your ensign!""""To fight forthwith means defeat,"" said Jia Xu.Li Meng and Wang Fang cried with one voice, ""If we fail, we are willing to lose our heads! But if we win, then your head is forfeit.""Jia Xu then suggested to Li Jue and Guo Si, saying, ""Seventy miles west of the capital stand the Zhouzhi Hills. The passes are narrow and difficult. Send Generals Zhang Ji and Fan Chou to occupy this point of vantage and fortify themselves so that they may support Li Meng and Wang Fang.""Li Jue and Guo Si accepted this advice. They told off fifteen thousand horse and foot, and Li Meng and Wang Fang left in high spirit. They made a camp ninety miles from Changan.The force from the west arrived. Ma Teng and Han Sui led out their troops to the attack. They found their opponents Li Meng and Wang Fang in battle array.Ma Teng and Han Sui rode to the front side by side. Pointing to the rebel leaders, the commanders abused them, crying, ""Those are traitors! Who will capture them?"""
言未絕，只見一位少年將軍，面如冠玉，眼若流星；虎體猿臂；彪腹狼腰；手執長鎗，坐騎駿馬，從陣中飛出。原來那將即馬騰之子馬超，字孟起，年方十七歲，英勇無敵。王方欺他年幼，躍馬迎戰。戰不到數合，早被馬超一鎗刺於馬下。馬超勒馬便回。李蒙見王方刺死，一騎馬從馬超背後趕來。超只做不知。馬騰在陣門下大叫：「背後有人追趕！」,"Hardly were the words spoken when there came out a youth general with a clear, white complexion as jade, eyes like shooting stars, lithe of body and strong of limb. He was armed with a long spear and bestrode an excellent steed. This young leader was Ma Chao, son of Ma Teng, then seventeen years of age.Though young he was a supreme valiance. Wang Fang, despising him on account of his youth, galloped forth to fight him. Before they had exchanged many passes Wang Fang was disabled and fell to a thrust of Ma Chao's spear. The victor turned to retire into the formation, but Li Meng rode after Ma Chao to avenge his fallen colleague.Ma Chao did not see Li Meng, but his father called out: ""You are followed!"""
聲猶未絕，只見馬超已將李蒙擒在馬上。原來馬超明知李蒙追趕，卻故意俄延；等他馬近，舉鎗刺來，超將身一閃，李蒙搠個空，兩馬相並，被馬超輕舒猿臂，生擒過去。軍士無主，望風奔逃。馬騰、韓遂乘勢追殺，大獲勝捷，直逼隘口下寨，把李蒙斬首號令。,"Hardly had Ma Teng spoken when he saw that the pursuer was a prisoner seated on his son's steed. Now Ma Chao had known he was followed, but pretended not to see, waiting till his enemy should have come close and lifted his spear to strike. Then Ma Chao suddenly wheeled about. The spear thrust met only empty air; and as the horses passed, Ma Chao's powerful arm shot out and pulled Li Meng from the saddle. Thus Li Meng and Wang Fang's soldiers were left leaderless and fled in all directions. The army of Ma Teng and Han Sui dashed in pursuit, and a complete victory was scored. They pressed into one of the passes and made a camp. Then they decapitated Li Meng and exposed his head."
李傕、郭汜聽知李蒙、王方皆被馬超殺了，方信賈詡有先見之明，重用其計，只理會緊守關防，由他搦戰，並不出迎。果然西涼軍未及兩月，糧草俱乏，商議回軍。恰好長安城中馬宇家僮出首家主與劉範、种邵，外連馬騰、韓遂，欲為內應等情。李傕、郭汜大怒，盡收三家少良賤斬於市，把三顆首級，直來門前號令。,"When Li Jue and Guo Si heard that both the boastful generals had fallen under the hand of one young leader, they knew that Jia Xu had given good advice and was gifted with clear prescience. So they valued his plans the more highly and decided to act on the defensive. They refused all challenges to combat.Surely enough after a couple of months the supplies of the Xiliang force were all exhausted and the leaders began to consider retreat.Just at this juncture a household servant of Ma Yu's family betrayed his master and told of the conspiracy of the three court officials to assist the attackers. The two chiefs Li Jue and Guo Si in revenge seized the three conspirators —-Ma Yu, Chong Shao, and Liu Fan —-, with every member of their households, and beheaded them in the market place. The heads of the three were exposed at the front gate of the capital."
馬騰、韓遂見軍糧已盡，內應又泄，只得拔寨退軍。李傕、郭汜令張濟引軍趕馬騰，樊稠引軍趕韓遂，西涼軍大敗。馬超在後死戰，殺退張濟。樊稠去趕韓遂，看看趕上，相近陳倉，韓遂勒馬向樊稠曰：「吾與公乃同鄉之人，今日何太無情？」樊稠也勒住馬答道：「上命不可違！」韓遂曰：「吾此來亦為國家耳，公何相逼之甚也？」樊稠聽罷，撥轉馬頭，收兵回寨，讓韓遂去了。不隄防李傕之姪李別，見樊稠放走韓遂，回報其叔。李傕大怒，便欲興兵討樊稠。賈詡曰：「目今人心未寧，頻動干戈，深為不便；不若設一宴，請張濟、樊稠慶功，就席間擒稠斬之，毫不費力。」,"Being short of food and hearing of the destruction of their three adherents in the city, the only course for Ma Teng and Han Sui was to retreat. At once Zhang Ji went in pursuit of Ma Teng, and Fan Chou followed Han Sui. The retreating army under Ma Teng was beaten, and only by Ma Chao's desperate efforts were the pursuers driven off.Fan Chou pursued the other army. When he had come close, Han Sui rode boldly up and addressed him, saying, ""You and I, Sir, are fellow villagers. Why then behave so unfriendly?""Fan Chou replied, ""I must obey the commands of my chief.""""I am here for the service of the state. Why do you press me so hard?"" said Han Sui.At this Fan Chou turned his horse, called in his troops, and left Han Sui in peace. Unwittingly a nephew of Li Jue had been a witness of this scene; and when he saw the enemy allowed to go free, he returned and told his uncle. Angry that his enemy had escaped, Li Jue would have sent an army to wreak vengeance on his general.But his adviser Jia Xu again came in, saying, ""The people are yet unsettled: It is dangerous to provoke another war. Instead, invite Fan Chou to a banquet and, while the feast was in progress, execute him for dereliction of duty."""
李傕大喜，便設宴請張濟、樊稠。二將忻然赴宴。酒半闌，李傕忽然變色曰：「樊稠何故交通韓遂，欲謀造反？」稠大驚；未及回言，只見刀斧手擁出，早把樊稠斬首於案下。嚇得張濟俯伏於地。李傕扶起曰：「樊稠謀反，故而誅之；公乃吾之心腹，何須驚懼？」將樊稠軍撥與張濟管領。張濟自回弘農去了。,"This seemed good to Li Jue, so the banquet was prepared. Zhang Ji and Fan Chou accepted their invitations and went cheerfully.Toward the latter part of the entertainment a sudden change came over their host Li Jue, and he suddenly asked Fan Chou, ""Why have you been intriguing with Han Sui? You are turning traitor, eh?""The unhappy guest was taken aback. Before he could frame his words to reply, he saw the assassins rush out with swords and axes. In a moment all was over, and Fan Chou's head lay beneath the table.Scared beyond measure, his fellow-guest Zhang Ji groveled on the floor.""Fan Chou was a traitor,"" said the host, raising Zhang Ji by the arm, ""and he has his deserts. You are my friend and need not fear.""Li Jue gave Zhang Ji command of Fan Chou's army with which Zhang Ji returned to his headquarters garrison in Hongnong."
李傕、郭汜自戰敗西涼兵，諸侯莫敢誰何。賈詡屢勸撫安百姓，結納賢豪。自是朝廷微有生意。不想青州黃巾又起，聚眾數十萬，頭目不等，劫掠良民。太僕朱雋，保舉一人，可破群賊。李傕、郭汜問是何人。朱雋曰：「要破山東群賊，非曹孟德不可。」李傕曰：「孟德今在何處？」雋曰：「見為東郡太守，廣有軍兵。若命此人討賊，賊可剋日而破也。」李傕大喜，星夜草詔，差人齎往東郡，命曹操與濟北相鮑信一同破賊。操領了聖旨，會合鮑信，一同興兵，擊賊於壽陽。鮑信殺入重地，為賊所害。操追趕賊兵，直到濟北，降者數萬。操即用賊為前驅，兵馬到處，無不降須。不過百餘日，招安到降兵三十餘萬、男女百餘萬口。操擇精銳者，號為「青州兵」，其餘盡令歸農。操自此威名日重。捷書報到長安，朝廷加曹操為鎮東將軍。,"No one of the leaders among the leaguers dared attempt an attack on the party newly risen from Dong Zhuo's disaffection, while on the other hand Jia Xu never ceased to urge his masters to exert themselves for the welfare of the people and thus to tempt wise people to join them. And by these means the government began to prosper, and the court to reassert its authority.However, a new trouble arose in the shape of a resurgence of Yellow Scarves in Qingzhou. They came, under numerous chieftains, in the number of hundreds of thousand and plundered any place they reached.Court Administrator Zhu Jun said he knew of one who could destroy this sedition, and when asked who was the man he proposed, Zhu Jun said, ""You want to destroy this horde of rebels: You will fail unless you get the service of Cao Cao.""""And where is he?"" asked Li Jue.""He is Governor of Dongjun. He has a large army, and you have only to order him to act. The rising will be broken.""A messenger went post haste with a command for Cao Cao and Bao Xin, Lord of Jibei, to act together in quelling the rebellion. As soon as Cao Cao received the court command, he arranged with his colleagues first to attack the rebels at Shouyang. Bao Xin made a dash right into their midst and inflicting damage wherever he could, but he was killed in battlefield. Cao Cao pursued the rebels as they fled to Jibei. Ten thousand surrendered. Then Cao Cao put his former enemies in the van. When his army reached any place, many more surrendered and joined him. After one hundred days, he had won over three hundred thousand troops and more than one million ordinary folks.Of these new adherents the strongest and boldest were made the Qingzhou Army, and the others were sent home to their fields. In consequence of these successes Cao Cao's prestige and fame became very great and increased daily. He reported his success to Capital Changan and was rewarded with the title of General Who Guards the East.Liu Dai then submitted; he and his officials sent to Dongjun and invited Cao Cao to take over Yanzhou."
操在兗州，招賢納士。有叔姪二人來投曹操：乃穎川穎陰人：姓荀，名彧，字文若，荀昆之子也；舊事袁紹，今棄紹投操；操與語大悅，曰：「此吾之子房也！」遂以為行軍司馬。其姪荀攸，字公達，海內名士，曾拜黃門侍郎，後棄官歸鄉，今與其叔同投曹操，操以為行軍教授。荀彧曰：「某聞兗州有一賢士，今此人知何在。」操問是誰，彧曰：「乃東郡東阿人：姓程，名昱，字仲德。」操曰：「吾亦聞名久矣。」遂遣人於鄉中尋問。訪得他在山中讀書，操拜請之。程昱來見，曹操大喜。,"At his new headquarters, Cao Cao welcomed wise counselors and bold warriors, and many gathered around him. Two clever persons, uncle and nephew, came at the same time, both from Yingchuan, named Xun Yu and Xun You. The uncle had once been in the service of Yuan Shao.Cao Cao rejoiced when he had won the elder Xun to his side, saying, ""Xun Yu is my Zhang Liang!""He made Xun Yu a Field Commander. The nephew Xun You was famed for his ability and had been in the court service when it was in Luoyang, but he had abandoned that career in the Inner Bureau and retired to his village. Cao Cao made him a Military Instructor.Xun Yu said to Cao Cao, ""There is a certain wise person of Yanzhou somewhere, but I do not know in whose service he is.""""Who is he?""""Cheng Yu. He belongs to the eastern part of Yanzhou.""""Yes, I have heard of him,"" said Cao Cao.So a messenger was sent to his native place to inquire. Cheng Yu was away in the hills engaged in study. Cao Cao sent the messenger to the hills, and Cheng Yu came at the invitation."
昱謂荀彧曰：「某孤陋寡聞，不足當公之薦。公之鄉人姓郭，名嘉，字奉孝，乃當今賢士，何不羅而致之？」彧猛省曰：「吾幾忘卻！」遂啟操徵聘郭嘉到兗州，共論天下之事。郭嘉薦光武嫡派子孫，淮南成德人：姓劉，名曄，字子陽。操即聘曄至。曄又薦二人：一個是山陽昌邑人：姓滿，名寵，字伯寧；一個是武城人：姓呂，名虔，字子恪。曹操亦素知這兩個名譽，就聘為軍中從事。滿寵、呂虔共薦一人：乃陳留平邱人：姓毛，名玠，字孝先。曹操亦聘為從事。又有一將引軍數百人，來投曹操：乃泰山鉅平人：姓于，名禁，字文則。操見其人弓馬熟嫺，武藝出眾，命為典軍司馬。,"""I shall prove unworthy of your recommendation,"" said Cheng Yu to his friend Xun Yu, ""for I am rough and ignorant. But have you forgotten a fellow villager of yours, Guo Jia? He is really able. Why not spread the net to catch him?""""I had nearly forgotten!"" said Xun Yu suddenly.So he told Cao Cao of this man, who was at once invited.Guo Jia, discussing the world at large with Cao Cao, recommended Liu Ye from Henan, who was a descendant of Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter Han. When Liu Ye had arrived, he was the means of inviting two more: Man Chong from Shanyang and Lu Qian from Wucheng, who were already known to Cao Cao by reputation. These two brought to their new master's notice the name of Mao Jie from Chenliu, who also came and was given office. Then a famous leader, with his troop of some hundreds, arrived to offer service. This was Yu Jin of Taishan, an expert horseman and archer, and skilled beyond his fellows in every form of military exercise. He was made an Army Inspector."
一日，夏侯惇引一大漢來見，操問何人，惇曰：「此乃陳留人：姓典，名韋，勇力過人。舊跟張邈，與帳下人不和，手殺數十人，逃竄山中。惇出射獵，見韋逐鹿過澗，因收於軍中。今特薦之於公。」操曰：「吾觀此人容貌魁梧，必有勇力。」惇曰：「他曾為友報讎殺人，提頭直出鬧市，數百人不敢近。只今所使兩枝鐵戟，重八十斤，挾之上馬，運使如飛。」操即令韋試之。韋挾戟驟馬，往來馳騁。忽見帳下大旗為風所吹，岌岌欲倒，眾軍士挾持不定；韋下馬喝退眾軍，一手執定旗桿，立於風中，巍然不動。操曰：「此古之惡來也！」遂命為帳前都尉，解身上錦襖，及駿馬雕鞍賜之。自是曹操部下文有謀臣，武有猛將，威鎮山東。,"Then another day Xiahou Dun brought a fellow to present to Cao Cao.""Who is he?"" asked Cao Cao.""He is from Chenliu and is named Dian Wei. He is the boldest of the bold, the strongest of the strong. He was one of Zhang Miao's people, but quarreled with his tent companions and killed some dozens of them with his fists. Then he fled to the mountains where I found him. I was out shooting and saw him follow a tiger across a stream. I persuaded him to join my troop, and I recommend him.""""I see he is no ordinary man,"" said Cao Cao. ""He is fine and straight and looks very powerful and bold.""""He is! He killed a man once to avenge a friend and carried his head through the whole market place. Hundreds saw him, but dared not come near. The weapon he uses now is a couple of spears, each weighs a hundred and twenty pounds, and he vaults into the saddle with these under his arm.""Cao Cao bade the man give proof of his skill. So Dian Wei galloped to and fro carrying the spears. Then he saw away among the tents a huge banner swaying dangerously with the force of the wind and on the point of falling. A crowd of soldiers were vainly struggling to keep it steady. Down he leaped, shouted to the men to clear out and held the staff quite steady with one hand, keeping it perfectly upright in spite of the strong wind.""This is old E Lai again!"" said Cao Cao.He gave Dian Wei a post of Commander of the Headquarters Guards and besides made Dian Wei presents of an embroidered robe he was wearing and a swift steed with a handsome saddle.Cao Cao encouraged able people to assist him, and he had advisers on the civil side and valiant generals in the army. He became famous throughout the East of the Passes."
乃遣泰山太守應劭，往瑯琊郡迎父曹嵩。嵩自陳留避難，隱居瑯琊；當日接了書信，便與弟曹德及一家老小四十餘人，帶從者百餘人，車百餘輛，逕望兗州而來。道經徐州，太守陶謙，字恭祖，為人溫厚純篤，向欲結納曹操，正無其由；知操父經過，遂出境迎接，再拜致敬，大設筵宴，款待兩日。曹嵩要行，陶謙親送出郭，特差都尉張闓，將部兵五百護送。,"Now Cao Cao's father, Cao Song, was living at Langye, whither he had gone as a hidden place free from the turmoil of the partisan struggles. Cao Cao wished to be united with him. As a dutiful son, Cao Cao sent the Governor of Taishan, Ying Shao, to escort his father to Yanzhou. Old Cao Song read the letter with joy, and the family prepared to move. They were some forty in all, with a train of a hundred servants and many carts.Their road led through Xuzhou Region where the Imperial Protector, Tao Qian, was a sincere and upright man who had long wished to get on good terms with Cao Cao but, hitherto, had found no means of effecting a bond of union. Hearing that Cao Cao's family was passing through his region, Tao Qian went to welcome them, treated them with great cordiality, feasting and entertaining them for two days; and when they left, he escorted them to his boundary. Further he sent with them General Zhang Kai with a special escort of five hundred."
曹嵩率家小行到華、費間，時夏末秋初，大雨驟至，只得投一古寺歇宿。寺僧接入，嵩安頓家小，命張闓將軍馬屯於兩廊。眾軍衣裝，都被雨打濕，同聲嗟怨。張闓喚手下頭目於靜處商議曰：「我們本是黃巾餘黨，勉強降順陶謙，未有好處；如今曹嵩輜重車輛無數，你們欲得富貴不難，只就今夜三更，大家砍將入去，把曹嵩一家殺了，取了財物，同往山中落草。此計何如？」,"The whole party reached the county of Huafei. It was the end of summer, just turning into autumn, and at this place they were stopped by a tremendous storm of rain. The only shelter was an old temple and thither they went. The family occupied the main rooms and the escort the two side wings. The men of the escort were drenched, angry, and discontented.Then Zhang Kai called some of his petty officers to a secret spot and said, ""We are old Yellow Scarves and only submitted to Tao Qian because there was no other choice. We have never got much out of it. Now here is the Cao family with no end of gear, and we can be rich very easily. We will make a sudden onslaught tonight at the third watch and slay the whole lot. Then we shall have plenty of treasure, and we will get away to the mountains."""
眾皆應允。是夜風雨未息，曹嵩正坐，忽聞四壁喊聲大舉。曹德提劍出看，就被搠死。曹嵩忙引一妾奔入方丈後，欲越牆而走；妾肥胖不能出，嵩慌急，與妾躲於廁中，被亂軍所殺。應邵死命逃脫，投袁紹去了。張闓殺盡曹嵩全家，取了財物，放火燒寺，與五百人逃奔淮南去了。後人有詩曰：,"They all agreed. The storm continued into the night; and as Cao Song sat waiting anxiously for signs of clearing, he suddenly heard a hubbub at the west end of the temple. His brother, Cao De, drawing his sword, went out to see what it was about, and Cao De was at once cut down. Cao Song seized one of the concubines by the hand, rushed with her through the passage toward the back of the temple so that they might escape. But the lady was stout and could not get through the narrow doors, so the two hid in one of the small outhouses at the side. However, they were seen and slain.The unhappy Governor Ying Shao fled for his life to Yuan Shao. The murderers fled into the South of River Huai with their plunder after having set fire to the old temple."
曹操奸雄世所誇，曾將呂氏殺全家。如今闔戶逢人殺，天理循環報不差。,"Cao Cao, whom the ages praise,Slew his hosts on his former flight;Nemesis never turns aside,Murdered too his family died."
當下應劭部下有逃命的軍士，報與曹操。操聞之，哭倒於地。眾人救起。操切齒曰：「陶謙縱兵殺吾父，此讎不共戴天！吾今悉起大軍，洗蕩徐州，方雪吾恨！」遂留荀彧、程昱領軍三萬守鄄城，范縣，東阿三縣，其餘盡殺奔徐州來。夏侯惇，于禁，典韋為先鋒。操令但得城池，將城中百姓，盡行屠戮，以雪父讎。當有九江太守邊讓，與陶謙交厚，聞知徐州有難，自引兵五千來救。操聞之大怒，使夏侯惇於路截殺之。,"Some of the escort escaped and took the evil tidings to Cao Cao. When he heard it he fell to the earth with a great cry. They raised him.With set teeth he muttered, ""Tao Qian's people have slain my father: No longer can the same sky cover us! I will sweep Xuzhou off the face of the earth. Only thus can I satisfy my vengeance.""Cao Cao left one small army of thirty thousand under Xun Yu and Cheng Yu to guard the east headquarters and the three counties of Juancheng, Fanxia, and Dongjun. Then he set forth with all the remainder to destroy Xuzhou and avenge his father. Xiahou Dun, Yu Jin, and Dian Wei were Van Leaders with Cao Cao's orders to slaughter all the inhabitants of each captured city.Now the Governor of Jiujiang, Bian Rang, was a close friend of Tao Qian. Hearing Xuzhou was threatened, Bian Rang set out with five thousand troops to his friend's aid. Angered by this move, Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to stop and kill Bian Rang while still on the march."
時陳宮為東郡從事，亦與陶謙交厚；聞曹操起兵報讎，欲盡殺百姓，星夜前來見操。操知是為陶謙作說客，欲待不見，又滅不過舊恩，只得請入帳中相見。宮曰：「今聞明公以大兵臨徐州，報尊父之讎，所到欲盡殺百姓，某因此特來進言。陶謙乃仁人君子，非好利忘義之輩；尊父遇害，乃張闓之惡，非謙罪也。且州縣之民，與明公何讎？殺之不祥。望三思而行。」操怒曰：「公昔棄我而去，今有何面目復來相見？陶謙殺吾一家，誓當摘膽剜心，以雪吾恨！公雖為陶謙游說，其如吾不聽何？」陳宮辭出，歎曰：「吾亦無面目見陶謙也！」遂馳馬投陳留太守張邈去了。,"At this time Chen Gong was in office in Dongjun, and he was also on friendly terms with Tao Qian. Hearing of Cao Cao's design to destroy the whole population, Chen Gong came in haste to see his former companion. Cao Cao, knowing Chen Gong's errand, put him off at first and would not see him. But then Cao Cao could not forget the kindness he had formerly received from Chen Gong, and presently the visitor was called to his tent.Chen Gong said, ""They say you go to avenge your father's death on Xuzhou, to destroy its people. I have come to say a word. Imperial Protector Tao Qian is humane and a good man. He is not looking out for his own advantage, careless of the means and of others. Your worthy father met his unhappy death at the hands of Zhang Kai. Tao Qian is guiltless. Still more innocent are the people, and to slay them would be an evil. I pray you think over it.""Cao Cao retorted angrily, ""You once abandoned me, and now you have the impudence to come to see me! Tao Qian slew my whole family, and I will tear his heart out in revenge. I swear it! You may speak for your friend and say what you will. I shall be as if I heard not.""Intercession had failed. Chen Gong sighed and took his leave.He said, ""Alas! I cannot go to Tao Qian and look upon his face.""So Chen Gong rode off to the county of Chenliu to give service to Governor Zhang Miao."
且說操大軍所到之處，殺戮人民，發掘墳墓。陶謙在徐州，聞曹操起軍報讎，殺戮百姓，仰天慟哭曰：「我獲罪於天，致使徐州之民，受此大難！」急聚眾官商議。曹豹曰：「曹兵既至，豈可束手待死！某願助使君破之。」,"Cao Cao's army of revenge laid waste whatever place it passed through, slaying the people and desecrating their cemeteries (AD 193).When Tao Qian heard the terrible tidings, he looked up to heaven, saying, ""I must be guilty of some fault before Heaven to have brought this evil upon my people!""He called together his officials to consult.One of them, Cao Bao, said, ""Now the enemy is upon us: We cannot sit and await death with folded hands. I for one will help you to make a fight."""
陶謙只得引兵出迎，遠望操軍如鋪霜湧雪，中軍豎起白旗二面，大書「報讎雪恨」四字。軍馬列成陣勢。曹操縱馬出陣，身穿縞素，揚鞭大罵。陶謙亦出馬於門旗下，欠身施禮曰：「謙本欲結好明公，故託張闓護送。不想賊心不改，致有此事。實不干陶謙之故：望明公察之。」操大罵曰：「老匹夫！殺吾父，尚敢亂言！誰可生擒老賊？」夏侯惇應聲而出。陶謙慌走入陣。夏侯惇趕來，曹豹挺鎗躍馬，前來迎敵。兩馬相交，忽然狂風大作，飛沙走石，兩軍皆亂，各自收兵。,"Tao Qian reluctantly sent the army out. From a distance he saw Cao Cao's army spread abroad like frost and rushed far and wide like snow. In their midst was a large white flag and on both sides was written Vengeance.When he had ranged his troops, Cao Cao rode out dressed in mourning white and abused Tao Qian.But Tao Qian advanced, and from beneath his ensign he bowed low and said, ""I wished to make friends with you, Illustrious Sir, and so I sent Zhang Kai to escort your family. I knew not that his rebel heart was still unchanged. The fault does not lie at my door as you must see.""""You old wretch! You killed my father, and now you dare mumble this nonsense!"" said Cao Cao.And he asked who would go out and seize Tao Qian.Xiahou Dun undertook this service and rode out. Tao Qian fled to the inner portion of his array; and as Xiahou Dun came on, Cao Bao went to meet him. But just as the two horses met, a hurricane burst over the spot, and the flying dust and pebbles threw both sides into the utmost confusion. Both drew off."
陶謙入城，與眾計議曰：「曹兵勢大難敵，吾當自縛往操營，任其剖割，以救徐州百姓之命。」言未絕，一人進前言曰：「府君久鎮徐州，人民感恩。今曹兵雖眾，未能既破我城。府君與百姓堅守勿出；某雖不才，願施小策，教曹操死無葬身之地！」眾人大驚，便問計將安出。正是：,"Tao Qian retired into the city and called his officers to council.""The force against us is too strong,"" said he. ""I will give myself up as a prisoner and let him wreak his vengeance on me. I may save the people.""But a voice was heard saying, ""You have long ruled here, and the people love you. Strong as the enemy are, they are not necessarily able to break down our walls, especially when defended by you and your people. I have a scheme to suggest that I think will make Cao Cao die in a place where he will not find burial.""These bold words startled the assembly, and they eagerly asked what the scheme was."
本為納交反成怨，那知絕處又逢生？畢竟此人是誰，且聽下文分解。,"Making overtures for friendship, Tao Qian encountered deadly hate.But, where danger seemed most threatening, he discovered safety's gate.The next chapter will disclose who the speaker was."
