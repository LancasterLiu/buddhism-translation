卻說曹操大破呂布於定陶，布乃收集敗殘軍馬於海濱，眾將皆來會集，欲再與曹操決戰。陳宮曰：「今曹兵勢大，未可與爭；先尋取安身之地，那時再來未遲。」布曰：「吾欲再投袁紹，何如？」宮曰：「先使人往冀州探聽消息，然後可去。」布從之。,"The last chapter told of the defeat of Lu Bu, and his gathering the remnant of his army at Dingtao. When all his generals had joined him, he began to feel strong enough to try conclusions with Cao Cao once again.Said Chen Gong, who was opposed to this course, ""Cao Cao is too strong right now. Seek some place where we can rest a time before trying.""""Suppose I went to Yuan Shao,"" said Lu Bu.""Send first to make inquiries.""Lu Bu agreed."
且說袁紹在冀州，聞知曹操與呂布相持，謀士審配進曰：「呂布，豺虎也：若得兗州，必圖冀州。不若助操攻之，方可無患。」紹遂遣顏良將兵五萬，往助曹操。細作探知這個消息，飛報呂布。布大驚，與陳宮商議。宮曰：「聞劉玄德新領徐州，可往投之。」布從其言，竟投徐州來。,"The news of the fighting between Cao Cao and Lu Bu had reached Jizhou, and one of Yuan Shao's advisers, Shen Pei, warned him, saying, ""Lu Bu is a savage beast. If he gets possession of Yanzhou, he will certainly attempt to add this region to it. For your own safety you should help to crush him.""Wherefore Yuan Shao sent Yan Liang with fifty thousand troops to destroy Lu Bu. The spies heard this and at once told Lu Bu, who was greatly disturbed and called in Chen Gong.""Go over to Liu Bei, who has lately succeeded to Xuzhou,"" said Chen Gong.Hence Lu Bu went thither."
有人報知玄德。玄德曰：「布乃當今英勇之士，可出迎之。」糜竺曰：「呂布乃虎狼之徒，不可收留；收則傷人矣。」玄德曰：「前者非布襲兗州，怎解此郡之禍？今彼窮而投我，豈有他心？」張飛曰：「哥哥心腸忒好。雖然如此，也要準備。」,"Hearing this, Liu Bei said, ""Lu Bu is a hero, and we will receive him with honor.""But Mi Zhu was strongly against receiving him, saying, ""He was a cruel, bloodthirsty beast!""But Liu Bei replied, ""How would misfortune have been averted from Xuzhou, if he had not attacked Yanzhou? He cannot have bad intention, now that he comes seeking an asylum.""""Brother, your heart is really too good. Although it may be as you say, yet it would be well to prepare,"" said Zhang Fei."
玄德領眾出城三十里，接著呂布，並馬入城。都到州衙廳上，講禮畢，坐下。布曰：「某自與王司徒計殺董卓之後，又遭傕、汜之變，飄零關東，諸侯多不能相容。近因曹賊不仁，侵犯徐州蒙使君力救陶謙，布因襲兗州以分其勢；不料反墮奸計，敗兵折將。今投使君，共圖大事，未審尊意如何？」玄德曰：「陶使君新逝，無人管領徐州，因令備權攝州事。今幸將軍至此，合當相讓。」遂將牌印與呂布。呂布卻待要接，只見玄德背後關、張二公各有怒色。布乃佯笑曰：「量呂布一勇夫，何能作州牧乎？」玄德又讓。陳宮曰：「『強賓不壓主』，請使君勿疑。」玄德方止。遂設宴相待，收拾宅院安下。,"Liu Bei with a great following met Lu Bu ten miles outside the city gates, and the two chiefs rode in side by side. They proceeded to the residence and there, after the elaborate ceremonies of reception were over, they sat down to converse.Said Lu Bu, ""After Minister of the Interiror Wang Yun and I plotted to slay Dong Zhuo and my misfortune in the Li Jue and Guo Si's sedition, I drifted about from one place to another, and none of the nobles in the East of Huashan Mountains seemed willing to receive me. When Cao Cao with wicked ambition invaded this region and you, Sir, came to its rescue, I aided you by attacking Yanzhou and thus diverting a portion of his force. I did not think then that I should be the victim of a vile plot and lose my leaders and my soldiers. But now if you will, I offer myself to you that we may together accomplish great designs.""Liu Bei replied, ""When the late Imperial Protector Tao Qian died, there was no one to administer Xuzhou, and so I assumed that task for a time. Now since you are here, General, it is most suitable that I step down in your favor.""Whereupon Liu Bei took the insignia and the seal of authority and handed them to Lu Bu. Lu Bu was on the point of accepting them, when he saw Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, who stood behind Liu Bei, glaring at him with angry eyes.So Lu Bu put on a smile and said, ""I may be something of a fighting man, but I could not rule a great region like this.""Liu Bei repeated his offer.But Chen Gong said, ""The strong guest does not oppress his host. You need not fear, my lord!""Then Liu Bei desisted. Banquets were held and dwelling places prepared for the guest and his retinue."
次日，呂布回席請玄德，玄德乃與關、張同往。飲酒至半酣，布請玄德入後堂。關、張隨入。布令妻女出拜玄德。玄德再三謙讓。布曰：「賢弟不必推讓。」張飛聽了，瞋目大叱曰：「我哥哥是金枝玉葉，你是何等人，敢稱我哥哥為賢弟！你來！我和你鬥三百合！」玄德連忙喝住，關公勸飛出。玄德與呂布陪話曰：「劣弟酒後狂言，兄勿見責。」布默默無語。須臾席散。布送玄德出門，張飛躍馬橫鎗而來，大叫：「呂布！我和你併三百合！」玄德急令關公勸止。,"As soon as convenient, Lu Bu returned the feast. Liu Bei went with his two brothers. Half through the banquet Lu Bu requested Liu Bei to retire to one of the inner private rooms, whither Guan Yu and Zhang Fei followed him. There Lu Bu bade his wife and daughter bow as to their benefactor. Here also Liu Bei showed excessive modesty.Lu Bu said, ""Good younger brother, you need not be so very modest.""Zhang Fei heard what Lu Bu said, and his eyes glared, shouting, ""What sort of a man are you that dares call our brother 'younger brother'? He is one of the ruling family —-a jade leaf on a golden branch. Come out, and I will fight you three hundred bouts for the insult!""Liu Bei hastily checked the impulsive one, and Guan Yu persuaded him to go away.Then Liu Bei apologized, saying, ""My poor brother talks wildly after he has been drinking. I hope you will not blame him.""Lu Bu nodded, but said nothing. Soon after the guests departed. But as the host escorted Liu Bei to his carriage, he saw Zhang Fei galloping up armed as for a fray.""Lu Bu, you and I will fight that duel of three hundred bouts!"" shouted Zhang Fei.Liu Bei bade Guan Yu check him."
次日呂布來辭玄德曰：「蒙使君不棄，但恐令弟輩不能相容。布當別投他處。」玄德曰：「將軍若去，某罪大矣。劣弟冒犯，另日當令陪話。近邑小沛，乃備昔日屯兵之處。將軍不嫌淺狹，權且歇馬，如何？糧食軍需，謹當應付。」呂布謝了玄德，自引軍投小沛安身去了。玄德自去埋怨張飛不題。,"Next day Lu Bu came to take leave of his host. ""You, O Lord, kindly received me, but I fear your brothers and I cannot agree. So I will seek some other asylum.""""General, if you go, the blame is mine. My rude brother has offended and must eventually apologize. In the meantime what think you of a temporary sojourn at the town where I was encamped for some time, Xiaopei? The place is small and mean, but it is near, and I will see to it that you are supplied with all you need.""Lu Bu thanked him and accepted this offer. He led his troops there and took up residence. After he had gone, Liu Bei reproved Zhang Fei for what he did, and Zhang Fei did not again refer to the matter."
卻說曹操平了山東，表奏朝廷，加操為建德將軍費亭侯。其時李傕自為大司馬，郭汜自為大將軍，橫行無忌，朝廷無人敢言。太尉楊彪、大司農朱雋暗奏獻帝曰：「今曹操擁兵二十餘萬，謀臣武將數十員，若得此人扶持社稷，剿除奸黨，天下幸甚。」獻帝泣曰：「朕被二賊欺凌久矣，若得誅之誠為大幸！」彪奏曰：「臣有一計，先令二賊自相殘害；然後詔曹操引兵殺之，掃清賊黨，以安朝廷。」獻帝曰：「計將安出？」彪曰：「聞郭汜之妻最妒，可令人於汜妻處用反間計，則二賊自相害矣。」,"That Cao Cao had subdued the region around Shandong Mountains has been stated before. He memorialized the Throne and was rewarded with the title of General Who Exhibits Firm Virtue and Lord of Feiting.At this time Li Jue and Guo Si were commanding the court. Li Jue had made himself Regent Marshal, and his colleague Guo Si styled himself Grand Commander. Their conduct was abominable but no one dared to criticize them.Imperial Guardian Yang Biao and Minister Zhu Jun privately talked with Emperor Xian and said, ""Cao Cao has over two hundred thousand troops and many capable advisers and leaders. It would be well for the empire if he would lend his support to the imperial family and help to rid the government of this evil party.""His Majesty wept, ""I am weary of the insults and contempt of these wretches and should be very glad to have them removed.""""I have thought of a plan to estrange Li Jue and Guo Si and so make them destroy each other. Then Cao Cao could come and cleanse the court,"" said Yang Biao.""How will you manage it?"" asked the Emperor.""Guo Si's wife, Lady Qiong, is very jealous, and we can take advantage of her weakness to bring about a quarrel."""
帝乃書密詔付楊彪。彪即暗使夫人以他事入郭汜府，乘間告汜妻曰：「聞郭將軍與李司馬夫人有染，其情甚密。倘司馬知之，必遭其害。夫人宜絕其往來為妙。」汜妻訝曰：「怪見他經宿不歸！卻幹出如此無恥之事！非夫人言，妾不知也。當慎防之。」彪妻告歸，汜妻再三稱謝而別。,"So Yang Biao received instruction to act, with a secret edict to support him.So Yang Biao's wife, Lady Kai, made an excuse to visit Lady Qiong at her palace and, in the course of conversation, said ""There is talk of secret liaison between the General, your husband, and the wife of Minister Li Jue. It is a great secret, but if Minister Li Jue knew it, he might try to harm your husband. I think you ought to have very little to do with that family.""Lady Qiong was surprised but said, ""I have wondered why he has been sleeping away from home lately, but I did not think there was anything shameful connected with it. I should never have known if you had not spoken. I must put a stop to it.""By and by, when Lady Kai took her leave, Lady Qiong thanked her warmly for the information she had given."
過了數日郭汜又將往李傕府中飲宴。妻曰：「傕性不測，況今兩雄不並立，倘彼酒後置毒，妾將奈何？」汜不肯聽妻再三勸住。至晚間，傕使人送酒筵至。汜妻乃暗置毒於中，方始獻入。汜便欲食。妻曰：「食自外來，豈可便食？」乃先與犬試之，犬立死。自此汜心懷疑。,"Some days passed, and Guo Si was going over to the dwelling of Li Jue to a dinner.Lady Qiong did not wish him to go and she said, ""This Li Jue is very deep, and one cannot fathom his designs. You two are not of equal rank, and if he made away with you, what would become of your poor handmaid?""Guo Si paid no attention, and his wife could not prevail on him to stay at home. Late in the afternoon some presents arrived from Li Jue's palace, and Lady Qiong secretly put poison into the delicacies before she set them before her lord.Guo Si was going to taste at once but she said, ""It is unwise to consume things that come from outside. Let us try on a dog first.""They did, and the dog died. This incident made Guo Si doubt the kindly intentions of his colleague."
一日朝罷，李傕力邀郭汜赴家飲宴。至夜席散，汜醉而歸，偶然腹痛。妻曰：「必中其毒矣！」急令將糞汁灌之，一吐方定。汜大怒曰：「吾與李傕共圖大事，今無端欲謀害我，我不先發，必遭毒手。」遂密整本部甲兵，欲攻李傕。早有人報知傕。傕亦大怒曰：「郭亞多安敢如此！」遂點本部甲兵，來殺郭汜。城下混戰，乘勢擄掠居民。,"One day, at the close of business at court, Li Jue invited Guo Si to his palace. After Guo Si arrived home in the evening, rather the worse for too much wine, he was seized with a colic. His wife said she suspected poison and hastily administered an emetic, which relieved the pain.Guo Si began to feel angry, saying, ""We did everything together and helped each other always. Now he wants to injure me! If I do not get in the first blow, I shall suffer some injury.""So Guo Si began to prepare his guards for any sudden emergency.This was told to Li Jue, and he in turn grew angry, saying, ""So Guo Si is doing so and so!""Then Li Jue got his guards under way and came to attack Guo Si. Both houses had ten thousand, and the quarrel became so serious that they fought a pitched battle under the city walls. When that was over both sides turned to plunder the people."
傕姪李暹引兵圍住宮院，用車二乘，一乘載天子，一乘載伏皇后，使賈詡、左靈監押車駕；其餘宮人內侍，並皆步走。擁出後宰門，正遇郭汜兵到，亂箭齊發，射死宮人不知其數。李傕隨後掩殺，郭汜兵退，車駕冒險出城，不由分說，竟擁到李傕營中。郭汜領兵入宮，盡搶擄宮嬪采女入營，放火燒宮殿。次日，郭汜知李傕劫了天子，領軍來營前廝殺。帝后都受驚恐。後人有詩歎之曰：,"Then a nephew of Li Jue, Li Xian, suddenly surrounded the Palace, put the Emperor and Empress in two carriages, and assigned Jia Xu and Zuo Ling to carry them off. The Palace attendants were made to follow on foot. As they went out of the rear gate, they met Guo Si's army who began to shoot at the cavalcade with arrows. They killed many attendants before Li Jue's army came up and forced them to retire.The carriages got out of the Palace and eventually reached Li Jue's camp, while Guo Si's soldiers plundered the Palace and carried off all the women left there to their camp. Then the Palace was set on fire.As soon as Guo Si heard of the whereabouts of the Emperor, he came over to attack the camp of Li Jue. The Emperor between these two opposing factions was greatly alarmed. Indeed:"
光武中興漢世，上下相承十二帝。桓靈無道宗社墮，閹臣擅權為叔季。無謀何進作三公，欲除社鼠招奸雄。豺獺雖驅虎狼入，西州逆豎生淫凶。王允赤心托紅粉，致令董呂成矛盾。渠魁殄滅天下寧，誰知李郭心懷憤。神州荊棘爭奈何，六宮饑饉愁干戈。人心既離天命去英雄割據分山河。後王規此存兢業，莫把金甌等閒缺。生靈糜爛肝腦塗，剩水殘山多怨血。我觀遺史不勝悲，今古茫茫歎黍離。人君當守苞桑戒，太阿誰持全綱維？,"Slowly the Hans had declined but renewed their vigor with Liu Xiu,Twelve were the rulers before him, followed him also twelve others.Foolish were two of the latest, dangers surrounded the altars,These were degenerate days, with authority given to eunuchs.Then did He Jin the simple, the inept, who commanded the army,Warriors call to the capital, wishing to drive out the vermin;Though they drove out the leopards, tigers and wolves quickly entered.All kinds of evil were wrought by a low class creature from Xizhou.Wang Yun, honest of heart, beguiled this wretch with a woman,Much desired of his henchman, thus sowing seeds of dissension.Strife resulted, and peace no longer dwelt in the empire.No one suspected that Li Jue and Guo Si would continue the evil,Much to the sorrow of the Middle Kingdom; yet they stove for a trifle.Famine stalked in the Palace, grief for the clashing of weapons;Why did the warlords strive? Why was the land thus partitioned?They had turned aside from the way appointed of Heaven.Kings must ponder these things; heavy the burden lies on them,Chiefest in all the realm theirs is no common appointment,Should the King falter or fail, calamities fall on the multitude people,The empire is drenched with their blood, grisly ruin surrounds them.Steeped in sorrow and sad, read you the ancient records;Long is the tale of years; the tale of sorrow is longer.Wherefore one who would rule, chiefly must exercise forethought.This and a keen-edged blade, these must suffice to maintain one."
卻說郭汜兵到，李傕出營接戰。汜軍不利，暫且退去。傕乃移帝后車駕於郿塢，使姪李暹監之，斷絕內使，飲食不繼，侍臣皆有飢色。帝令人問傕取米五斛，牛骨五具，以賜左右。傕怒曰：「朝夕上飯，何又他求？」乃以腐肉朽糧與之，皆臭不可食。帝罵曰：「逆賊直如此相欺！」侍中楊彪急奏曰：「傕性殘暴；事勢至此，陛下且忍之，不可攖其鋒也。」帝乃低頭無語，淚盈袍袖。,"Guo Si's army arrived, and Li Jue went out to give battle. Guo Si's troops had no success and retired. Then Li Jue removed the imperial captives to Meiwu with his nephew Li Xian as gaoler. Supplies were reduced, and famine showed itself on the faces of the eunuchs. The Emperor sent to Li Jue to request five carts of rice and five sets of bullock bones for his attendants.Li Jue angrily replied, ""The court gets food morning and evening. Why do they ask for more?""He sent putrid meat and rotten grain.The Emperor was very vexed at the new insult, uttering, ""How dare the rebels do that to me?""Court Counselor Yang Qi advised patience, saying, ""Li Jue is a base creature but, under the present circumstances, Your Majesty must put up with it. You may not provoke him.""The Emperor bowed and was silent, but the tears fell on his garments."
忽左右報曰：「有一路軍馬，鎗刀映日，金鼓震天，前來救駕。」帝打聽是誰，乃郭汜也。帝心轉憂。只聞塢外喊聲大起。原來李傕引兵出迎郭汜，鞭指郭汜而罵曰：「我待你不薄，你如何謀害我？」汜曰：「你乃反賊，如何不殺你！」傕曰：「我保駕在此，何為反賊？」汜曰：「此乃劫駕，何為保駕？」傕曰：「不須多言！我兩個各不許用軍士，只自併輸贏。贏的便把皇帝取去罷了。」二人便就陣前廝殺。戰到十合，不分勝負。只見楊彪拍馬而來，大叫：「二位將軍少歇，老夫特邀眾官，來與二位講和。」傕、汜乃各自還營。,"Suddenly someone came in with the tidings: ""A force of cavalry, their sabers glittering in the sun, are approaching to rescue the Chariot!""Then they heard the gongs beat and the roll of the drums. The Emperor sent to find out who it was. But it was Guo Si, and the sadness fell again.Presently arose a great din. For Li Jue had gone out to do battle with Guo Si, whom he abused by name.""I treated you well, and why did you try to kill me?"" said Li Jue.""You are a rebel, why should I not slay you?"" cried Guo Si.""You call me rebel when I am guarding the Emperor?""""You have abducted him: Do you call that guarding?""""Why so many words? Let us forgo a battle and settle the matter in single combat, the winner to take the Emperor and go.""The two generals fought in front of their armies, but neither could prevail over the other.Then they saw Yang Biao come riding up to them, crying, ""Rest a while, O Commanders! For I have invited a party of officers to arrange a peace.""Wherefore the two leaders retired to their camps."
楊彪與朱雋會合朝廷官僚六十餘人，先詣郭汜營中勸和。郭汜竟將眾官盡行監下。眾官曰：「我等為好而來，何乃如此相待？」汜曰：「李傕劫天子，偏我劫不得公卿！」楊彪曰：「一劫天子，一劫公卿，意欲何為？」汜大怒，便拔劍欲殺彪。中郎將楊密力勸，汜乃放了楊彪，朱雋，其餘都監在營中。彪謂雋曰：「為社稷之臣，不能匡君救主，空生天地間耳！」言訖，相抱而哭，昏絕於地。雋歸家成病而死。自此之後，傕、汜每日廝殺，一連五十餘日，死者不知其數。,"Soon Yang Biao, Zhu Jun, and sixty other officials came up and went to Guo Si's camp. They were all thrown into confinement.""We came with good intentions,"" they moaned, ""and we are treated like this!""""Li Jue has run off with the Emperor; I have to have the officers,"" said Guo Si.""What does it mean? One has the Emperor, the other his officers. What do you want?"" said Yang Biao.Guo Si lost patience and drew his sword, but General Yang Mi persuaded him not to slay the speaker. Then Guo Si released Yang Biao and Zhu Jun but kept the others in the camp.""Here we are —-two officers of the Throne —-, and we cannot help our lord. We have been born in vain!"" said Yang Biao to Zhu Jun.Throwing their arms about each other, they wept and fell swooning to the earth. Zhu Jun went home, fell seriously ill and died.Thereafter the two adversaries fought every day for nearly three months, each losing many soldiers."
卻說李傕平日最喜左道妖邪之術，常使女巫擊鼓降神於軍中，賈詡屢諫不聽。侍中楊琦密奏帝曰：「臣觀賈詡雖為李傕腹心，然實未嘗忘君，陛下當與謀之。」,"Now Li Jue was irreligious and practiced magic. He often called witches to beat drums and summon spirits, even when in camp. Jia Xu used to remonstrate with him, but quite uselessly.Yang Qi said to the Emperor, ""That Jia Xu, although a friend of Li Jue, never seems to have lost the sense of loyalty to Your Majesty."""
正說之間，賈詡來到。帝乃屏退左右泣諭詡曰：「卿能憐漢朝，救朕命乎？」詡拜伏於地曰：「固臣所願也。陛下且勿言，臣自圖之。」帝收淚而謝。,"Soon after Jia Xu himself arrived. The Emperor sent away his attendants and said to Jia Xu, weeping the while, ""Can you not pity the Hans and help me?""Jia Xu prostrated himself, saying, ""That is my dearest wish. But, Sire, say no more: Let thy servant work out a plan."" The Emperor dried his tears."
少頃，李傕來見，帶劍而入。帝面如土色。傕謂帝曰：「郭汜不臣，監禁公卿，欲劫陛下。非臣則駕被擄矣。」帝拱手稱謝，傕乃出。時皇甫酈入見帝。帝知酈能言，又與李傕同鄉，詔使往兩邊解和。酈奉詔，走至汜營說汜。汜曰：「如李傕送出天子，我便放出公卿。」,"Soon Li Jue came in. He wore a sword by his side and strode straight up to the Emperor, whose face became the color of clay.Then Li Jue spoke, ""Guo Si has failed in his duty and imprisoned the court officers. He wished to slay Your Majesty, and you would have been captured but for me.""The Emperor joined his hands together in salute and thanked Li Jue. Li Jue went away.Before long Huangfu Li entered. The Emperor, knowing him as a man of persuasive tongue and that he came from the same county as Li Jue, bade him go to both factions to try to arrange peace.Huangfu Li accepted the mission and first went to Guo Si, who said, ""I would release the officers if Li Jue would restore the Emperor to full liberty."""
酈即來見李傕曰：「今天子以某是西涼人，與公同鄉，特令某來勸和二公。汜已奉詔，公意若何？」傕曰：「吾有敗呂布之大功，輔政四年，多著勳績，天下共知。郭亞多盜馬賊耳，乃敢擅劫公卿，與我相抗，誓必誅之！君試觀我方略士眾，足勝郭亞多否？」酈答曰：「不然：昔有窮后羿，恃其善射，不思患難，以致滅亡。近董太師之強，君所目見也，呂布受恩而反圖之，斯須之間，頭懸國門。則強固不足恃矣。將軍身為上將，持鉞仗節，子孫宗族，皆居顯位，國恩不可謂不厚。今郭亞多劫公卿，而將軍劫至尊，果誰輕誰重耶？」,"Huangfu Li then went to the other side. To Li Jue he said, ""Since I am a Xiliang man, the Emperor and the officers have selected me to make peace between you and your adversary. Guo Si has consented to cease the quarrel. Will you agree to peace?""""I overthrew Lu Bu, have upheld the government for four years, and have many great services to my credit as all the world knows. That other fellow, that horse-thief, has dared to seize the officers of state and to set himself up against me. I have sworn to slay him. Look around you. Do you not think my army large enough to break him?""""It does not follow,"" said Huangfu Li. ""In ancient days in Youqiong, Hou Yi, proud of and confident in his archer's skill, gave no thought to others and governed alone, and he so perished. Lately you yourself have seen the powerful Dong Zhuo betrayed by Lu Bu, who had received many benefits at his hands. In no time Dong Zhuo's head was hanging over the gate. So you see mere force is not enough to ensure safety. Now you are a general, with the axes and whips and all the symbols of rank and high office; your descendants and all your clan occupy distinguished positions. You must confess that the state has rewarded you liberally. True, Guo Si has seized the officers of state, but you have done the same to the 'Most Revered'. Who is worse than the other?"""
李傕大怒，拔劍叱曰：「天子使汝來辱我乎？我先斬汝頭！」騎都尉楊奉諫曰：「今郭汜未除，而殺天使，則汜興兵有名，諸侯皆助之矣。」賈詡亦力勸，傕怒少息。詡遂推皇甫酈出。酈大叫曰：「李傕不奉詔，欲弒君自立！」侍中胡邈急止之曰：「無出此言！恐於身不利。」酈叱之曰：「胡敬才！汝亦為朝廷之臣，如何附賊？『君辱臣死』吾被李傕所殺，乃分也！」大罵不止。帝知之，急令皇甫酈回西涼。,"Li Jue angrily drew his sword and shouted, ""Did the Son of Heaven send you to mock and shame me?""But his commander, Yang Feng, checked him.""Guo Si is still alive,"" said Yang Feng, ""and to slay the imperial messenger would be giving him a popular excuse to raise an army against you. And all the nobles would join him.""Jia Xu also persuaded Li Jue, and gradually his wrath cooled down. Huangfu Li was urged to go away.But Huangfu Li would not be satisfied with failure. As he went out of the camp, he cried loudly, ""Li Jue will not obey the Emperor's command. He will kill his prince to set up himself!""Counselor Hu Miao tried to shut Huangfu Li's mouth, saying, ""Do not utter such words. You will only bring hurt upon yourself!""But Huangfu Li shrieked at him also, saying, ""You also are an officer of state, and yet you even back up the rebel. When the prince is put to shame, the minister dies. That is our code. If it be my lot to suffer death at the hands of Li Jue, so be it!""And Huangfu Li maintained a torrent of abuse. The Emperor heard of the incident, called in Huangfu Li and sent him away to his own country Xiliang."
卻說李傕之軍，大半是西涼人氏，更賴羌兵為助。卻被皇甫酈揚言於西涼人曰：「李傕謀反，從之者即為賊黨，後患不淺。」西涼人多有聽酈之言，軍心漸渙。傕聞酈言，大怒，差虎賁王昌追之。昌知酈乃忠義之士，竟不往追，只回報曰：「酈已不知何往矣。」賈詡又密諭羌人曰：「天子知汝等忠義，久戰勞苦，密詔使汝還郡，後當有重賞。」羌人正怨李傕不與爵賞，遂聽詡言，都引兵去。,"Now more than half Li Jue's troops were from Xiliang, and he had also the assistance of the Qiangs, the northern tribespeople beyond the border. When Huangfu Li spread that Li Jue was a rebel and so were those who helped him, and that there would be a day of heavy reckoning, those stories disturbed the soldiers.Li Jue sent one of his officers, General Wang Chan of the Tiger Army, to arrest Huangfu Li. But Wang Chan had a sense of right and esteemed Huangfu Li as an honorable man. Instead of carrying out the orders, Wang Chan returned to say Huangfu Li could not be found.Meanwhile Jia Xu tried to work on the feelings of the tribespeople.He said to them, ""The Son of Heaven knows you are loyal to him and have bravely fought and suffered. He has issued a secret command for you to go home, and then he will reward you.""The tribesmen had a grievance against Li Jue for not paying them, so they listened readily to the insidious persuasions of Jia Xu and deserted."
詡又密奏帝曰：「李傕貪而無謀，今兵散心怯，可以重爵餌之。」帝乃降詔，封傕為大司馬。傕喜曰：「此女巫降神祈禱之力也！」遂重賞女巫，卻不賞軍將。騎都尉楊奉大怒，謂宋果曰：「吾等出生入死，身冒矢石，功反不及女巫耶？」宋果曰：「何不殺此賊，以救天子？」奉曰：「你於中軍放火為號，吾當引兵外應。」二人約定是夜二更時分舉事。不料其事不密，有人報知李傕。傕大怒，令人擒宋果先殺之。楊奉引兵在外，不見號火。李傕自將兵出，恰遇楊奉，就寨中混戰到四更。奉不勝，引軍投西安去了。李傕自此軍勢漸衰。更兼郭汜常來攻擊，殺死者甚多。忽人來報：「張濟統領大軍，自陝西來到，欲與二公解和；聲言如不從者，引兵擊之。」傕便賣個人情，先遣人赴張濟軍中許和。郭汜亦只得許諾。張濟上表，請天子駕幸弘農。帝喜曰：「朕思東都久矣。今乘此得還，乃萬幸也！」詔封張濟為驃騎將軍。濟進糧食酒肉，供給百官。汜放公卿出營。傕收拾車駕東行，遣舊有御林軍數百，持戟護送。,"Then Jia Xu advised the Emperor, ""Li Jue is covetous in nature. He is deserted and enfeebled. A high office should be granted to him to lead him astray.""So the Emperor officially appointed Li Jue Regent Marshal. This delighted him greatly, and he ascribed his promotion to the potency of his wise witches' prayers and incantations. He rewarded those people most liberally.But his army was forgotten. Wherefore his commander, Yang Feng, was angry.Yang Feng said to General Song Guo, ""We have taken all the risks and exposed ourselves to stones and arrows in his service, yet instead of giving us any reward he ascribes all the credit to those witches of his.""""Let us put him out of the way and rescue the Emperor,"" said Song Guo.""You explode a bomb within as signal, and I will attack from outside.""So the two agreed to act together that very night in the second watch. But they had been overheard, and the eavesdropper told Li Jue. Song Guo was seized and put to death. That night Yang Feng waited outside for the signal and while waiting, out came Li Jue himself. Then a melee began, which lasted till the fourth watch. But Yang Feng got away and fled to Xian.But from this time Li Jue's army began to fall away, and he felt more than ever the losses caused by Guo Si's frequent attacks. Then came news that Zhang Ji, at the head of a large army, was coming down from Shanxi to make peace between the two factions. Zhang Ji vowed he would attack the one who was recalcitrant. Li Jue tried to gain favor by hastening to send to tell Zhang Ji he was ready to make peace. So did Guo Si.So the strife of the rival factions ended at last, and Zhang Ji memorialized asking the Emperor to go to Hongnong near Luoyang.The Emperor was delighted, saying, ""I have longed to go back to the east.""Zhang Ji was rewarded with the title of Commander of the Flying Cavalry and was highly honored. Zhang Ji saw to it that the Emperor and the court had good supplies of necessaries. Guo Si set free all his captive officers, and Li Jue prepared transport for the court to move to the east. Li Jue told off companies of his Royal Guard to escort the cavalcade."
鑾輿過新豐，至霸陵，時值秋天，金風驟起。忽聞喊聲大作，數百軍兵來至橋上攔住車駕，勵聲問曰：「來者何人？」侍中楊琦拍馬上橋曰：「聖駕過此，誰敢攔阻？」有二將出曰：「吾等奉郭將軍命，把守此橋，以防奸細。既云聖駕，須親見帝，方可准信。」楊琦高揭珠簾。帝諭曰：「朕躬在此，卿何不退？」眾將皆呼萬歲，分於兩邊，駕乃得過。,"The progress had been without incident as far as Xinfeng. Near Baling Bridge the west wind of autumn came on to blow with great violence, but soon above the howling of the gale was heard the trampling of a force of several hundred. They stopped at a bridge and barred the way.""Who comes?"" cried a voice.""The Imperial Chariot is passing, and who dares stop it?"" said Court Counselor Yang Qi, riding forward.Two generals of the barring party advanced to Yang Qi, saying, ""General Guo Si has ordered us to guard the bridge and stop all spies. You say the Emperor is here: We must see him, and then we will let you pass.""So the pearl curtain was raised, and the Emperor said, ""I, the Emperor, am here. Why do you not retire to let me pass, gentlemen?""They all shouted, ""Wan sui! Long Life! Long Life!"" and fell away to allow the cortege through."
二將回報郭汜曰：「駕已去矣。」汜曰：「我正欲哄過張濟，劫駕再入郿塢，你如何擅自放了過去？」遂斬二將，起兵趕來。車駕正到華陰縣，背後喊聲震天，大叫：「車駕且休動！」帝泣告大臣曰：「方離狼窩，又逢虎口，如之奈何？」眾皆失色。賊軍漸近，只聽得一派鼓聲，山背後轉出一將，當先一面大旗，上書「大漢楊奉」四字，引軍千餘殺來。原來楊奉自為李傕所敗，便引軍屯終南山下；今聞駕至，特來保護。,"But when they reported what they had done, Guo Si was very angry, saying, ""I meant to outwit Zhang Ji, seize the Emperor, and hold him in Meiwu. Why have you let him get away?""He put the two officers to death, set out to pursue the cavalcade, and overtook it just at the county of Huaying.The noise of a great shouting arose behind the travelers, and a loud voice commanded, ""Stop the train!""The Emperor burst into tears. ""Out of the wolf's den into the tiger's mouth!"" said he.No one knew what to do: They were all too frightened. But when the rebel army was just upon them, they heard the beating of drums and from behind some hills came into the open a cohort of more than one thousand soldiers preceded by a great flag bearing the name Han General Yang Feng.Having defeated by Li Jue, Yang Feng fled to the foothills of Xian; and he came up to offer his services as soon as he heard the Emperor's journey."
當下列開陣勢。汜將崔勇出馬，大罵楊奉反賊。奉大怒，回顧陣中曰：「公明何在？」一將手執大斧，飛驟驊騮，直取崔勇。兩馬相交，只一合，斬崔勇於馬下。楊奉乘勢掩殺，汜軍大敗，退走二十餘里。奉乃收軍來見天子。帝慰諭曰：「卿救朕躬，其功不小！奉頓首拜謝。帝曰：「適斬賊將者何人？」奉乃引此將拜於車下曰：「此人河東楊郡人：姓徐，名晃，字公明。」帝慰勞之。楊奉保駕至華陰駐蹕。將軍段煨，具衣飲膳上獻。是夜，天子宿於楊奉營中。,"Seeing it was necessary to fight now, he drew up his line of battle. Guo Si's general, Cui Yong, rode out and began a volley of abuse. Yang Feng turned and said, ""Where is Xu Huang?""In response out came a valiant warrior gripping a heavy battle-ax. He galloped up on his fleet bay, making directly for Cui Yong, whom he felled at the first blow. At this the whole force dashed forward and routed Guo Si. The defeated army went back some seven miles.Yang Feng rode forward to see the Emperor, who graciously said, ""It is a great service you have rendered: You have saved my life.""Yang Feng bowed and thanked him, and the Emperor asked to see the actual slayer of the rebel leader. So Xu Huang was led to the chariot, where he bowed and was presented as Xu Huang of Hedong.The Emperor recognized the achievement of the warrior.Then the cavalcade went forward, Yang Feng acting as escort as far as the city of Huaying, the halting place for the night. The commander of the place, Duan Wei, supplied them with clothing and food. And the Emperor passed the night in Yang Feng's camp."
郭汜敗了一陣，次日又點軍殺至營前來，徐晃當先出馬。郭汜大軍八面圍來，將天子，楊奉，困在垓心。正在危急之中，忽然東南上喊聲大震，一將引軍縱馬殺來。賊眾奔潰。徐晃乘勢攻擊，大敗汜軍。那人來見天子，乃國戚董承也。帝哭訴前事。承曰：「陛下免憂。臣與楊將軍誓斬二賊，以靖天下。」帝命早赴東都。連夜駕起，前幸弘農。,"Next day Guo Si, having mustered his troops, appeared in front of the camp, and Xu Huang rode out to engage. But Guo Si threw his army out so that they entirely surrounded the camp, and the Emperor was in the middle. The position was very critical, when help appeared in the person of a galloping general from the southeast, and the rebels fell away at his assault. Then Xu Huang smote them and so scored a victory.When they had time to see their helper, they found him to be Dong Cheng, the uncle of the Emperor or the ""State Uncle"". The Emperor wept as he related his sorrows and dangers.Said Dong Cheng, ""Be of good courage, Sire. General Yang Feng and I have pledged ourselves to kill both the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si and so purify the world.""The Emperor bade them travel east as soon as possible, and so they went on night and day till they reached their destination Hongnong."
卻說郭汜敗軍回，撞著李傕，言：「楊奉、董承救駕往弘農去了。若到山東，立腳得定，必然布告天下，令諸侯共伐我等，三族不能保矣。」傕曰：「今張濟兵據長安，未可輕動。我和你乘間合兵一處，至弘農殺了漢君，平分天下，有何不可？」汜喜諾。二人合兵，於路劫掠，所過一空。楊奉、董承知賊兵遠來，遂勒兵回，與賊大戰於東澗。,"Guo Si led his defeated army back. Meeting Li Jue, he told Li Jue of the rescue of the Emperor and whither they was going.""If they reach the Huashan Mountains and get settled in the east, they will send out proclamations to the whole country, calling up the nobles to attack us, and we and our whole clans will be in danger,"" said Guo Si.""Zhang Ji is holding Changan, and we must be careful. There is nothing to prevent a joint attack on Hongnong, when we can kill the Emperor and divide the empire between us,"" said Li Jue.Guo Si found this a suitable scheme, so their armies came together again in one place and united in plundering the countryside. As they proceeded to Hongnong, they left destruction behind them.Yang Feng and Dong Cheng heard of the rebels' approach when they were yet a long way off, so Yang Feng and Dong Cheng turned back and decided to meet them at Dongjian."
傕、汜二人商議：「我眾彼寡，只可以混戰勝之。」於是李傕在左，郭汜在右，漫山遍野擁來。楊奉、董承兩邊死戰，剛保帝后車出；百官宮人，符冊典籍，一應御用之物，盡皆拋棄。郭汜引軍入弘農劫掠。承、奉保駕走陝北，傕、汜分兵趕來。承、奉一面差人與傕、汜講和，一面密聖旨往河東，急召故白波帥韓暹、李樂、胡才三處軍兵前來救應。那李樂亦是嘯聚山林之賊，今不得已而召之。三處軍聞天子赦罪賜官，如何不來；並拔本營軍士，來與董承相會，一齊再取弘農。,"Li Jue and Guo Si had previously made their plan. Since the loyal troops were few as compared with their own horde, they would overwhelm the loyal troops like a flood. So when the day of battle came, they poured out covering the hills and filling the plains. Yang Feng and Dong Cheng devoted themselves solely to the protection of the Emperor and Empress. The officials, the attendants, the archives and records, and all the paraphernalia of the court were left to care for themselves. The rebels ravaged Hongnong, but the two protectors got the Emperor safely away into Shanbei.When the rebel generals showed signs of pursuit, Yang Feng and Dong Cheng had to play a double-edged sword. They sent to offer to discuss terms of peace with Li Jue and Guo Si; at the same time they sent a secret edict to enlist help from the leaders of the White Wave rebels —-Han Xian, Li Yue, and Hu Cai. The White Wave was a branch of the Yellow Scarves, and Li Yue was actually a brigand and had ravaged throughout the woods and hills. But the need for help was so desperate.These three, being promised pardon for their faults and crimes and a grant of official rank, naturally responded to the call, and thus the loyal side was strengthened so that Hongnong was recaptured."
其時李傕、郭汜但到之處，劫掠百姓，老弱者殺之，強壯者充軍；臨敵則驅民兵在前，名曰「敢死軍」，賊勢浩大。李樂軍到，會於渭陽。郭汜令軍士將衣服物件拋棄於道。樂軍見衣服滿地，爭往取之，隊伍盡失。傕、汜二軍，四面混戰，樂軍大敗。楊奉、董承遮攔不住，保駕北走，背後賊軍趕來。李樂曰：「事急矣！請天子上馬先行！」帝曰：「朕不可捨百官而去。」,"But meanwhile Li Jue and Guo Si laid waste whatever place they reached, slaying the aged and weakly, forcing the strong to join their ranks. When going into a fight they forced these people-soldiers to the front, and they called them the ""Dare-to-Die"" soldiers.Li Jue and Guo Si's force was overwhelming. When Li Yue, the White Wave leader, approached with his army, Guo Si bade his soldiers scatter clothing and valuables along the road. The late robbers could not resist the temptation, so a scramble began. Then Guo Si's soldiers fell upon the disordered ranks and did much damage. Yang Feng and Dong Cheng had to take the Emperor away to the north.Li Jue and Guo Si pursued.Li Yue said, ""The danger is grave. I pray Your Majesty mount a horse and go in advance!""The Emperor replied, ""I cannot bear to abandon my officers."""
眾皆號泣相隨。胡才被亂軍所殺。承、奉見賊追急，請天子棄車駕，步行到黃河岸邊。李樂等尋得一隻小舟作渡船。時值天氣嚴寒，帝與后強扶到岸。邊岸又高，不得下船，後面追兵將至。楊奉曰：「可解馬韁繩接連，拴縳帝腰，於下船去。」人叢中國舅伏德，挾白絹十數疋，曰：「吾於亂軍中拾得此絹，可接連拽輦。」行軍校尉尚弘用絹包帝及后，令眾先挂帝往下於之，乃得下船。李樂仗劍立於船頭上，后兄伏德，負后下船中。岸上有不得下船者，爭扯船纜。李樂盡砍於水中。渡過帝后，再放船渡眾人。其爭渡者，皆被砍下手指，哭聲震天。,"They wept and struggled on as best they could. The White Wave leader Hu Cai was killed in one attack.The enemy came very near, and the Emperor left his carriage and went on foot. Yang Feng and Dong Cheng escorted him to the bank of the Yellow River. Li Yue sought a boat to ferry him to the other side. The weather was very cold, and the Emperor and Empress cuddled up close to each other shivering. They reached the river but the banks were too high, and they could not get down into the boat.So Yang Feng proposed, ""Fasten together the horses' bridles and lower down His Majesty slung by the waist.""However, the Empress' brother, Fu De, said, ""I found some ten rolls of plain silk from dead soldiers, and we can use them instead.""And they rolled up the two imperial personages in the silk, and thus they lowered them down near the boat. Then Li Yue took up his position in the prow leaning on his sword. Fu De carried the Empress on his back into the boat.The boat was too small to carry everybody, and those unable to get on board clung to the cable, but Li Yue cut them down, and they fell into the water. They ferried over the Emperor and then sent back the boat for the others. There was a great scramble to get on board, and they had to chop off the fingers and hands of those who persisted in clinging to the boat. The lamentation rose to the heavens."
既渡彼岸，帝左右止剩得十餘人。楊奉尋得牛車一輛，載帝至大陽。絕食，晚宿於瓦屋中，野老進粟飯，上與后共食，粗糲不能下咽。次日詔封李樂為征北將軍，韓暹為征東將軍，起駕前行。有二大臣尋至，哭拜車前：乃太尉楊彪、太僕韓融也。帝后俱哭。韓融曰：「傕、汜二賊，頗信臣言；臣捨命去說二賊罷兵。陛下善保龍體。」,"When they mustered on the farther bank, many were missing, only a dozen of the Emperor's suite were left. Yang Feng found a bullock cart and transported the Emperor and Empress to Dayang. They had no food and at night sought shelter in a poor, tile-roofed house. Some old country folks offered them boiled millet, but it was too coarse to be swallowed.Next day the Emperor conferred titles on those who had protected him. Li Yue was made General Who Conquers the North, and Han Xian was appointed General Who Conquers the East.The flight continued. Soon two officers of rank came up with the cortege, and they bowed before His Majesty with many tears. They were Imperial Guardian Yang Biao and Court Administrator Han Rong. The Emperor and Empress lifted up their voices and wept with them.Said Han Rong to his colleague, ""The rebels have confidence in my words. You stay as guard of the Emperor, and I will take my life in my hands and try to bring about peace."""
韓融去了，李樂請帝入楊奉營暫歇。楊彪請帝都安邑縣。駕至安邑，苦無高房，帝后都居於茅屋中；又無門關閉，四邊插荊棘以為屏蔽。帝與大臣議事於茅屋之下，諸將引兵於籬外鎮壓。李樂等專權，百官稍有觸犯，竟於帝前毆罵；故意送濁酒粗食與帝，帝勉強納之。李樂、韓暹又連名保奏黥徒、部曲巫醫走卒二百餘名，並為校尉御史等官。刻印不及，以錐畫之，全不成體統。,"After Han Rong had gone, the Emperor rested for a time in Yang Feng's camp. But Yang Biao requested the Emperor to head for Anyi and make the capital there. When the train reached the town, they found it containing not a single lofty building, and the court lived in grass huts devoid even of doors. They surrounded these with a fence of thorns as a protection, and within this the Emperor held counsel with his ministers. The soldiers camped round the fence.Now Li Yue and his fellow ruffians showed their true colors. They wielded the powers of the Emperor as they wished, and officials who offended them were beaten or abused even in the presence of the Emperor. They purposely provided thick wine and coarse food for the Emperor's consumption. He struggled to swallow what they sent. Li Yue and Han Xian joined in recommending to the Throne the names of convicts, common soldiers, sorcerers, leeches, and such people who thus obtained official ranks. There were more than two hundred of such people. As seals could not be engraved, pieces of wood were hammered into some sort of a shape. Court affairs had never degraded to such a low point."
卻說韓融曲說傕、汜二賊，二賊從其言，乃於百官及宮人歸。是歲大荒，百姓皆食野菜，餓莩遍野。河內太守張揚獻米肉，河東太守王邑獻絹帛，帝稍得寧。董承、楊奉商議，一面差人修洛陽宮院，欲奉車駕還東都，李樂不從，董承謂李樂曰：「洛陽本天子建都之地。安邑乃小地面，如何容得車駕？今奉駕還洛陽是正理。」李樂曰：「汝等奉駕去，我只在此處住。」,"Now Han Rong went to see Li Jue and Guo Si. After listening to his vigorous persuasions, the two rebel generals agreed to set free the officials and Palace people.A famine occurred that same year and people were reduced to eating grass from the roadside. Starving, they wandered hither and thither. But food and clothing were sent to the Emperor from the Governor of Henei, Zhang Yang, and the Governor of Hedong, Wang Yi, and the court began to enjoy a little repose.Dong Cheng and Yang Feng sent laborers to restore the palaces in Luoyang with the intention of moving the court thither. Li Yue was opposed to this.Dong Cheng argued, ""Luoyang is the original capital as opposed to the paltry town of Anyi. Removal would be but reasonable.""Li Yue wound up by saying, ""You may get the court to remove, but I shall remain here."""
承、奉乃奉駕起程。李樂暗令人結連李傕，郭汜，一同劫駕。董承，楊奉，韓暹知其謀，連夜擺佈軍士，護送車駕前奔箕關。李樂聞知，不等傕、汜軍到，自引本部人馬前來追趕。四更左側，趕到箕山下，大叫：「車駕休行！李傕、郭汜在此！」嚇得獻帝心驚膽戰，山上火光遍起。正是：,"But when the consent of the Emperor had been given and a start made by Dong Cheng and Yang Feng, Li Yue secretly sent to arrange with Li Jue and Guo Si to capture the Emperor. However, this plot leaked out, and the escort so arranged as to prevent such a thing, and they pressed on to the pass at Gu Hills as rapidly as possible. Li Yue heard this and, without waiting for his rebel colleagues to join him, set out to act alone.About the fourth watch, just as the cavalcade was passing Gu Hills, a voice was heard shouting, ""Stop those carriages! Li Jue and Guo Si are here!""This frightened the Emperor greatly, and his terror increased when he saw the whole mountain side suddenly light up. Indeed:"
前番兩賊分為二，今番三賊合為一。不知漢天子怎離此難，且聽下文分解。,"The rebel party, erstwhile split in twain,To work their wicked will now join three again.How the Son of Heaven escaped this peril will be told in the next chapter."
