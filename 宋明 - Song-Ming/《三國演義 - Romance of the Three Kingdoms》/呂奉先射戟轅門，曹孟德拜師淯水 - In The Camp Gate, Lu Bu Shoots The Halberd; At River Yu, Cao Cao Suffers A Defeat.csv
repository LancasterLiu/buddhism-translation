卻說楊大將獻計欲攻劉備。袁術曰：「計將安出？」大將曰：「劉備軍屯小沛，雖然易取，奈呂布虎踞徐州，前次許他金帛糧馬，至今未與，恐其助備；今當令人送與糧食，以結其心，使其按兵不動，則劉備可擒。先擒劉備，後圖呂布，徐州可得也。」術喜，便具粟二十萬斛，令韓胤齎密書往見呂布。呂布甚喜，重待韓胤。胤回告袁術，術遂遣紀靈為大將，雷簿、陳蘭為副將，統兵數萬，進攻小沛。,"Adviser Yang Dajiang knew how to remove Liu Bei.""What is your plan of attack on Liu Bei?"" said Yuan Shu.Yang Dajiang replied, ""Though Liu Bei, now camped at Xiaopei, could easily be taken, yet Lu Bu is strongly posted at the chief city near. And I think Lu Bu would help Liu Bei if it was only for the grudge he bears against you for not having given him the gold and studs, grain and horses you promised. First of all you should send Lu Bu a present whereby to engage his affections and keep him quiet while you deal with Liu Bei. You can see to Lu Bu after this is done, and Xuzhou is yours.""Thereupon two hundred thousand carts of millet was sent, with letters, by the hand of Han Yin. The gift pleased Lu Bu greatly, and he treated the messenger with great cordiality. Feeling sure of no trouble from that quarter, Yuan Shu told off one hundred thousand troops against Xiaopei. The army was led by Ji Ling as commanding general, and Lei Bo and Chen Lan as generals."
玄德聞知此信，聚眾商議。張飛要出戰。孫乾曰：「今小沛糧寡兵微，如何抵敵？可修書告急於呂布。」張飛曰：「那廝如何肯來！」玄德曰：「乾之言善。」送修書與呂布。書略曰。伏自將軍垂念，今備於小沛容身，實拜雲天之德。今袁術欲報私讎，遣紀靈領兵到縣，亡在旦夕，非將軍莫能救。望驅一旅之師，以救倒懸之急，幸甚幸甚！,"When Liu Bei heard these things he called his officers to take counsel. Zhang Fei was for open war forthwith.But Sun Qian said, ""Our resources were too small; therefore, we must lay the position before Lu Bu and ask help.""""Do you think that fellow will do anything?"" said Zhang Fei cynically.Liu Bei decided in favor of Sun Qian's proposal and wrote as follows:""Humbly I venture to remind you that I am here by your orders and enjoy repose as the result of your kindness, extensive as the heavens. Now Yuan Shu, moved by a desire for revenge, is sending a force against this place, and its destruction is imminent unless you intervene to save it. I trust you will send an army quickly to protect the town, and our happiness will be inexpressible."""
呂布看了書，與陳宮計議曰：「前者袁術送糧致書，蓋欲使我不救玄德也。今玄德又來求救，吾想玄德屯軍小沛，未必遂能為我害；若袁術併了玄德，則北連泰山諸將以圖我，我不能安枕矣；不若救玄德。」遂點兵啟程。,"Receiving this Lu Bu called in Chen Gong to whom he said, ""I have just received gifts from Yuan Shu and a letter, with the intent of restraining me from helping Liu Bei. Now comes a letter from Liu Bei asking help. It seems to me that Liu Bei where he is can do me no harm; but if Yuan Shu overcomes Liu Bei and comes to an understanding with the leaders around the Huashan Mountains, then the power of the north is so much nearer, and I should be unable to resist the attacks of so many leaders and should never sleep secure. I will aid Liu Bei: That is the better course for me."""
卻說紀靈起兵長驅大進，已到沛縣東南，劄下營寨。晝列旌旗，遮映山川；夜設火鼓，震崩天地，玄德縣中，止有五千餘人，也只得勉強領兵出縣，布陣安營。忽報呂布引軍離縣一里，西南上劄下營寨。紀靈知呂布領兵來救劉備，急令人致書於呂布，責其無信。布笑曰：「我有一計，使袁、劉兩家都不怨我。」乃發使往紀靈、劉備寨中，請二人飲宴。,"Now Yuan Shu's force sent against Xiaopei went thither as quickly as possible, and soon the country to the southeast fluttered with pennons by day and blazed with watch fires by night, while the rolling of the drums reverberated from heaven to earth.The five thousand troops at Liu Bei's disposal were led out of the city and arranged to make a brave show, but it was good news to him to hear that Lu Bu had arrived and was quite near. Lu Bu camped only half a mile away to the southwest. When Yuan Shu's general, Ji Ling, heard of his arrival, he wrote letters reproaching Lu Bu for his treachery. Lu Bu smiled as he read them.""I know how to make both of them love me,"" said Lu Bu.So he sent invitations to both Liu Bei and Ji Ling to come to a banquet."
玄德聞布相請，即便欲往。關、張曰：「兄長不可去。呂布必有異心。」玄德曰：「我待彼不薄，彼必不害我。」遂上馬而行。關、張隨往。到呂布寨中，入見。布曰：「吾今特解公之危，異日得志，不可相忘。」玄德稱謝。布請玄德坐。關、張按劍於立於背後。人報紀靈到，玄德大驚，欲避之。布曰：「吾特請你二人來會議，勿得生疑。」,"Liu Bei was for accepting the invitation and going, but his brothers dissuaded him, saying, ""There is some treachery in his heart.""""I have treated him too well for him to do me any harm,"" said Liu Bei.So he mounted and rode away, the two brothers following. They came to the camp.The host said, ""Now by a special effort I have got you out of danger. I hope you will not forget that when you come into your own.""Liu Bei thanked him heartily and was invited to take a seat. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took up their usual place as guards.But when Ji Ling was announced, Liu Bei felt a spasm of fear and got up to go away.""You two are invited for the particular purpose of a discussion,"" said the host. ""Do not take it amiss."""
玄德未知其意，心下不安。紀靈下馬入寨，卻見玄德在帳上坐，大驚，抽身便回，左右留之不住。呂布向前一把扯回，如提童稚。靈曰：「將軍欲殺紀靈耶？」布曰：「非也。」靈曰：「莫非殺大耳兒乎？」布曰：「亦非也」。靈曰：「然則為何？」布曰：「玄德與布乃兄弟也，今為將軍所困，故而救之。」靈曰：「若此則殺靈也？」布曰：「無有此理。布平生不好鬥，惟好解鬥。吾今為兩家解之。」靈曰：「請問今日解之之法。」布曰：「吾有一法，從天所決。」乃拉靈入帳與玄德相見。二人各懷疑忌，布乃居中坐，使靈居左，備居右，且教設宴行酒。,"Liu Bei, being quite ignorant of his intentions, was very uneasy. Presently his fellow guest entered. Seeing Liu Bei in the tent, and in the seat of honor, Ji Ling was puzzled, hesitated and tried to withdraw. But the attendants prevented this and Lu Bu, advancing, laid hold of him and drew him into the tent as if he had been a child.""Do you wish to slay me?"" asked Ji Ling.""Not at all,"" replied Lu Bu.""Then you are going to slay Long-Ears?""""No, not that.""""Then what does it mean?""""Liu Bei and I are brothers. Now, General, you are besieging him, and so I have come to the rescue.""""Then slay me,"" said Ji Ling.""There would be no sense in that. All my life I have disliked fighting and quarrels, but have loved making peace. And now I want to settle the quarrel between you two.""""May I ask how you think of doing so?""""I have a means and one approved of Heaven itself.""Then Lu Bu drew Ji Ling within the tent and led him up to Liu Bei. The two men faced each other, full of mutual suspicion, but their host placed himself between them and they took their seats, Liu Bei on the right hand of the host. The banquet began."
酒行數巡，布曰：「你兩家看我面上，俱各罷兵。」玄德無語。靈曰：「吾奉主公之命，提十萬之兵，專捉劉備，如何罷得？」張飛大怒，拔劍在手，叱曰：「吾雖兵少，覷汝輩如兒戲耳！你比百萬黃巾何如？你敢傷我哥哥！」關公急止之曰：「且看呂將軍如何主意，那時各回營寨廝殺未遲。」呂布曰：「我請你兩家解鬥，須不教你廝殺。」,"After a number of courses almost in silence, Lu Bu spoke, saying, ""I wish you two gentlemen to listen to me and put an end to your strife.""Liu Bei made no reply, but Ji Ling said, ""I have come with an army of one hundred thousand at the express bidding of my master to take Liu Bei. How can I cease the strife? I must fight.""""What!"" exclaimed Zhang Fei drawing his sword. ""Few as we are, we regard you no more than a lot of children. What are you compared with a million Yellow Scarves? You dare hurt our brother!""Guan Yu urged him to be silent, saying, ""Let us see what General Lu Bu has to say first. After that there will be time to go to our tents and fight.""""I beg you both to come to an understanding. I cannot let you fight,"" said Lu Bu."
這邊紀靈不忿，那邊張飛只要廝殺，布大怒，教「左右！取我戟來！」布提畫戟在手。紀靈、玄德、盡皆失色。布曰：「我勸你兩家不要廝殺，盡在天命。」令左右接過畫戟，去轅門外遠遠插定，乃回顧紀靈、玄德曰：「轅門離中軍一百五十步，吾若一箭射中戟上小枝，你兩家罷兵；如射不中時，各自回營，安排廝殺。有不從吾言者，併力拒之。」紀靈私忖：「戟在一百五十步之外，安能便中？且落得應允，待其不中，那時憑我廝殺。」便一口許諾。玄德自無不允。布都教坐，再各飲一杯酒。,"Now on one side Ji Ling was discontented and angry; on the other Zhang Fei was dying for a fight; and neither of the two chiefly concerned would signify assent.Then suddenly the host turned to his attendants, saying, ""Bring my trident halberd!""They did so, and he sat there gripping that graceful but effective weapon in his right hand. Both guests felt very ill at ease and turned pale.Lu Bu went on, saying, ""I have tried to persuade you to make peace, for that is the command of the Most High. It shall be put to the test.""He then bade his servants take the halberd outside beyond the gate and set it up.Then speaking to his two guests, he said, ""That gate is one hundred and fifty paces distant. If I can hit that left branch of the halberd-head with an arrow, you will both withdraw your armies. If I miss, you can go away and prepare for immediate battle. I shall stand against either of you who does not abide by what I say.""Ji Ling thought to himself, ""That small mark at that distance! How could anyone hit it?"" So he assented, thinking he would have plenty of fighting after his host had missed the mark. Of course Liu Bei was willing. They all sat down again and wine was served."
酒畢。布教取弓箭來。玄德暗祝曰：「只願他射得中便好！」只見呂布挽起袍袖，搭上箭，扯滿弓，叫一聲「著！」正是：弓開如秋月行天，箭去似流星落地，一箭正中畫戟小枝。帳上帳下將校，齊聲喝采。後人有詩讚之曰：,"When this had been drunk, the host called for his bow and arrows. Liu Bei silently prayed that Lu Bu would hit the mark.Lu Bu turned back his sleeves, carefully fitted an arrow to the string and pulled the bow to its utmost stretch. A slight exclamation escaped him as the bow curved like the harvest moon sailing through the sky. ""Twang!"" went the bowstring, and the arrow sped like a falling star. And it struck the slender tongue of the halberd head full and square. A roar of acclamation from all sides greeted the exploit.The multitude people often hail their praise:"
溫侯神射世間稀，曾向轅門獨解危。落日果然欺后羿，號猿直欲勝由基。,"O Lu Bu was a wonderful archer,And the arrow he shot sped straight;By hitting the mark he saved his friendThat day at his camp gate.Hou Yi, the archer of ancient days,Brought down each mocking sun,And the apes that gibbered to fright Yang YoujiWere slain by him, one by one."
虎觔弦響弓開處，雕羽翎飛箭到時。豹子尾搖穿畫戟，雄兵十萬脫征衣。,"But we sing of Lu Bu that drew the bow,And his feathered shaft that flew;For one hundred thousand soldiers could doff their mailsWhen he hit the mark so true."
當下呂布射中畫戟小枝，呵呵大笑，擲弓於地，執紀靈、玄德之手曰：「此天令你兩家罷兵也！」喝教軍士斟酒來，各飲一大觥。玄德暗稱慚愧。紀靈默然半晌，告布曰：「將軍之言，不敢不聽；奈紀靈回去，主人如何肯信？」布曰：「吾自作書覆之便了。」酒又數巡，紀靈求書先回。布謂玄德曰：「非我則公危矣。」玄德拜謝，與關、張回。次日，三處軍馬都散。,"Lu Bu laughed loud at the success of his shot. Dropping his bow he seized his guests by the hands, saying, ""The command of Heaven indeed! And now you cease from fighting!""He ordered the soldier attendants to pour out great goblets of wine and each drank. Liu Bei in his inmost heart felt rather lucky; his fellow guest sat silent, nodding his head.Presently Ji Ling said, ""I cannot disobey your command, General, but let me depart. What will my master say and will he believe me?""""I will write a letter and confirm it,"" said Lu Bu.After a few more rounds of the wine, Ji Ling asked that he might have the letter and after that departed.When the brothers took their leave, Lu Bu again reminded Liu Bei, saying, ""Do not forget I have delivered you today!""Liu Bei thanked him and departed. Next day the leaders broke camps, and the soldiers were gone."
不說玄德入小沛，呂布歸徐州。卻說紀靈回淮南見袁術，說呂布轅門射戟解和之事，呈上書信。袁術大怒曰：「呂布受吾許多糧米，反以此兒戲之事，偏護劉備；吾當自提重兵，親征劉備，兼討呂布！」紀靈曰：「主公不可造次。呂布勇力過人，兼有徐州之地；若布與備首尾相連，不易圖也。靈聞布妻嚴氏有一女，年已及笄。主公有一子，可令人求親於布。布若嫁女於主公，必殺劉備。此乃『疏不間親之計』也。」,"When Ji Ling had got back to the South of River Huai and told the story of the feat of archery and the peace making that followed, and had presented the letter, his lord was very wroth.""Lu Bu repays me for all my grain with this bit of play acting!"" cried Yuan Shu. ""He has saved Liu Bei, but I will lead a large army myself and settle both Liu Bei and him.""""Be careful, my lord,"" said Ji Ling. ""Lu Bu is braver and stronger than most leaders and has a wide territory. He and Liu Bei together make a powerful combination, not easy to break. But there is another course. I have found out that his wife, Lady Yan, has a daughter just of marriageable age; and as you have a son, you could arrange a marriage alliance with Lu Bu. If his daughter wedded your son, Lu Bu would certainly slay your enemy for you. This is called 'Relative-above-Stranger' plan."""
袁術從之，即日遣韓胤為媒，齎禮物往徐州求親。胤到徐州見布，稱說：「主公仰慕將軍，欲求令嬡為兒婦，永結『秦晉之好』。」布入謀於妻嚴氏。原來呂布有二妻一妾：先娶嚴氏為正妻，後娶貂蟬為妾；及居小沛時，又娶曹豹之女為次妻。曹氏先亡無出，貂蟬亦無所出，惟嚴氏生一女，布最鍾愛。,"This scheme appealed to Yuan Shu, who soon set about its accomplishment. He sent presents by the hand of Han Yin, who was to discuss the question.When Han Yin saw Lu Bu, he said, ""My master has an immense respect for you, Illustrious Sir, and he desires to ensure perpetual alliance between the two families by a marriage, an alliance such as existed between the ancient states of Qin and Jin.""Lu Bu was well disposed toward the scheme, but went in to consult his wife. Now Lu Bu had two wives and one concubine. He first married a lady of the Yan family, and she was the legal wife. Then he took Diao Chan as a concubine. And while he was living at Xiaopei, he had married a secondary wife, a daughter of Cao Bao. Lady Cao had died quite young leaving no issue. Neither had Diao Chan borne any children. So that Lu Bu had but one child, this daughter, of whom he was dotingly fond."
當下嚴氏謂布曰：「吾聞袁公路久鎮淮南，兵多糧廣，早晚將為天子。若成大事，則吾女有后妃之望；─只不知他有幾子？」布曰：「止有一子。」妻曰：「既如此，即當許之。縱不為皇后，吾徐州亦無憂矣。」布意遂決，厚款韓胤，許了親事。韓胤回報袁術。術即備聘禮，仍令韓胤送至徐州。呂布受了，設席相待，留於館驛安歇。,"When he broached the subject, his wife said, ""The Yuans have dominated the regions around the River Huai these many years. They have a large army and are very prosperous. One day a Yuan will become emperor, and our daughter may hope to be an empress. But how many sons has Yuan Shu?""""Only this one.""""Then we should accept the offer. Even if our daughter does not become Empress, Xuzhou has a new ally.""Lu Bu decided to accept and so treated the messenger with extreme generosity. Han Yin went back with a favorable answer. The wedding gifts were then prepared ready for Han Yin to take to the bride's family. They were received and banquets and merry-making filled all the time."
次日，陳宮竟往館驛內拜望韓胤，講禮畢，坐定。宮乃叱退左右，對胤曰：「誰獻此計？教袁公與奉先聯姻，意在取劉玄德之頭乎？胤失驚，起謝曰：「乞公臺勿洩！」宮曰：吾自不洩，只恐其事若遲，必被他人識破，事將中變。」胤曰：「然則奈何？願公教之。」宮曰：「吾見奉先，使其即日送女就親，何如？」胤大喜，稱謝曰：「若如此，袁公感佩明德不淺矣！」,"Next day Chen Gong went to see the messenger in his lodging, and when the usual ceremonies and greetings had been exchanged, the two men sat down to talk.When the servants had been sent out of earshot, Chen Gong said, ""Who originated this scheme by which Yuan Shu and Lu Bu are to become connections by this marriage so that Liu Bei's head may fall?""Han Yin was terrified. ""I pray you not to let it get abroad,"" said he.""I certainly shall keep it secret. But if there be any delay, some other person will find it out and that spells failure,"" said Chen Gong.""What would best be done?""""I will see Lu Bu and get him to send the girl immediately so that the marriage may be concluded quickly.""""If it happened thus, my master would indeed hold you in high respect."""
宮遂辭別韓胤，入見呂布曰：「聞公女許嫁袁公路，甚喜。但不知於何日結親？」布曰：「尚容徐議。」宮曰：「古者自受聘至成婚之期，各有定例：天子一年，諸侯半年，大夫一季，庶民一月。」布曰：「袁公路天賜國寶，早晚當為帝，今從天子例，可乎？」宮曰：「不可。」布曰：「然則仍從諸侯例？」宮曰：「亦不可。」布曰：「然則將從卿大夫例矣？」宮曰：「亦不可。」布笑曰：「公豈欲吾依庶民例耶？」宮曰：「非也」布曰：「然則公意欲如何？」,"With this Chen Gong took his leave and sought an interview with Lu Bu.""I hear your daughter is to be married to Yuan Shu's son. That is capital, but no one knows when.""""That has yet to be considered,"" said Lu Bu.""There were certain fixed rules as to the period between sending presents and consummation of the marriage: Emperors, a year; nobles, half a year; high officers, three months; and common people, one month.""Lu Bu replied, ""As to Yuan Shu, Heaven has already put into his hands the Imperial Hereditary Seal, and he will surely arrive at the dignity one day. So, I should think the imperial rule would apply.""""No, it will not.""""The nobles' rule, then?""""No, nor that.""""The high officers'?""""Not even that.""Lu Bu laughed, saying, ""Then you mean me to go by the rule for common people.""""Nor that either.""""Then what do you mean?"""
宮曰：「方今天下諸侯，互相爭雄；今公與袁公路結親，諸侯保無有嫉妒者乎？若復遠擇吉期，或竟乘我良辰，伏兵半路以奪之，如之奈何？為今之計，不許便休；既已許之，當趁諸侯未知之時，即便送女到壽春，另居別館，然後擇吉成親，萬無一失也。」布喜曰：「公臺之言甚當。」遂入告嚴氏。連夜具辦妝奩，收拾寶馬香車，令宋憲、魏續一同韓胤送女前去。鼓樂喧天，送出城外。,"Chen Gong said, ""In the midst of the present troubles, when there is great rivalry among the nobles, do you not see that the others will be exceedingly jealous of your marriage alliance with such a high family as the Yuans? Suppose you postpone the choice of the day, most likely when your fine morning arrives, the wedding party will fall into an ambush on the road and the bride be carried off. Then what could be done? My opinion is that you would have done better to refuse. But since you have consented, then carry out the plan at once before the lords hear of it, and so send the girl over without delay to Shouchun. You can hire a lodging there till you have selected the wedding day, and the odds are greatly against any failure.""""What you say is quite to the point,"" replied Lu Bu.He went into the private apartments to see his wife and told her the bride elect would set out immediately and the trousseau was to be prepared as far as it could be. On his side he chose some good horses and had a wedding carriage got ready. The escort consisted of Han Yin and two of Lu Bu's generals, Song Xian and Wei Xu. The procession went out of the city to the sound of music."
時陳元龍之父陳珪，養老在家，聞鼓樂之聲，遂問左右。左右告以故。珪曰：「此乃『疏不間親之計』也。玄德危矣。」遂扶病來見呂布。布曰：「大人何來？」珪曰：「聞將軍死，故特來弔喪。」布驚曰：「何出此言？」,"Now at this time Chen Gui, father of Chen Deng, was placidly waiting till the evening of his life passed into night. Hearing this burst of music he inquired the occasion, and the servants told him.""They are working on the 'Relative-above-Stranger' device, then,"" said Chen Gui. ""Liu Bei is in danger.""Thereupon in spite of his many infirmities, he went to see Lu Bu.""Noble Sir, what brings you here?"" asked Lu Bu.""I heard you were dead, and I came to mourn,"" quavered the old man.""Who said that?"" exclaimed his host."
珪曰：「前者袁公路以金帛送公，欲殺劉玄德，而公以射戟解之；今忽來求親，其意蓋欲以公女為質，隨後就來攻玄德而取小沛。小沛亡，徐州危矣。且彼或來借糧，或來借兵。公若應之，是疲於奔命，而又結怨於人；若其不允，是棄親而啟兵端也。況聞袁術已有稱帝之意，是造反也。彼若造反，則公乃反賊親屬矣，得無為天下所不容乎？」,"""Once upon a time you received grand presents from Yuan Shu that you might slay Liu Bei, but you got out by that clever shot at your halberd. Now they suddenly seek a marriage alliance thinking to get hold of your daughter as a pledge. The next move will be an attack on Xiaopei and, that gone, where are you? Whatever they ask in future, grain or troops or anything else, and you yield, will bring your own end nearer, and make you hated all round. If you refuse, then you are false to the duties of a relative, and that will be an excuse to attack you openly. Beside this Yuan Shu intends to call himself emperor, which would be rebellion, and you would be of the rebel's family: Something abominable, which the multitude people would not suffer."""
布大驚曰：「陳宮誤我！」急令張遼引兵追趕之。三十里之外將女搶歸；連韓胤都拏回監禁，不放歸去；卻令人回復袁術，只說女兒妝奩未備，俟備畢便自送來。陳珪又說呂布，使解韓胤赴許都。布猶豫未決。忽人報：「玄德在小沛招軍買馬，不知何意？」布曰：「此為將者本分事，何足為怪？」,"Lu Bu was much disturbed to hear this.""I have been misled by Chen Gong!"" cried he.So he hurriedly sent Zhang Liao to bring the wedding party, which had been ten miles away, back to the city. When they had come, Lu Bu threw Han Yin into prison and sent a reply to Yuan Shu saying curtly that the girl's trousseau was not ready and she could not be married till it was.Chen Gui wanted Han Yin to be sent to Capital Xuchang. But Lu Bu was hesitating what course to adopt, when he heard that Liu Bei was enlisting soldiers and buying horses for no apparent reason.""He is simply doing his duty. There is nothing to be surprised at,"" said Lu Bu at first."
正話間，宋憲、魏續至，告布曰：「我二人奉明公之命，往山東買馬，買得好馬三百餘匹；回至沛縣界首，被強寇劫去一半，打聽得是劉備之弟張飛，詐裝山賊，搶劫馬匹去了。」呂布聽了大怒，隨即點兵往小沛，來攻張飛。玄德聞之大驚，慌忙引軍出迎。,"Then came two officers, Song Xian and Wei Xu, saying, ""As you ordered us, we went into the Huashan Mountains to purchase horses. We had got three hundred when, on our way back, on the borders of Xiaopei some robbers stole half of them. We hear that the real robbers were Zhang Fei and his soldiers, who took on the guise of brigands.""Lu Bu was very angry at this and began to prepare an expedition against Xiaopei. When Liu Bei heard that an attack threatened, he led out his army to oppose it."
兩陣圓處，玄德出馬曰：「兄長何故領兵到此？」布指罵曰：「我轅門射戟，救你大難，你何故奪我馬匹？」玄德曰：「備因缺馬，令人四下收買。安敢奪兄馬匹？」布曰：「你便使張飛奪了我好馬一百五十匹，尚自抵賴！」張飛挺鎗出馬曰：「是我奪了你好馬！你今待怎麼？」布罵曰：「環眼賊！你累次藐視我！」飛曰：「我奪你馬你便惱，你奪我哥哥的徐州便不說了！」,"The two armies were arrayed. Liu Bei rode to the front and said, ""Elder brother, why have you brought an army against me?""Lu Bu began abusing him, saying, ""That shot of mine at the Archery Feast saved you from grave danger. Why then did you steal my horses?""""I wanted horses and I sent out to buy them. Should I dare to take yours?"" said Liu Bei.""You stole a hundred and fifty in the person of your brother Zhang Fei. You only used another man's hand.""Thereupon Zhang Fei, with his spear set, rode out, saying, ""Yes! I stole your good horses, and what more do you expect?""Lu Bu replied, ""You goggled-eyed thief! You are always treating me with contempt!""""Yes! I took your horses and you get angry. You did not say any thing when you stole my brother's Xuzhou!"""
布挺戟出馬來戰張飛，飛亦挺鎗來迎。兩個酣戰一百餘合，未見勝負。玄德恐有疏失，急鳴金收軍入城。呂布分軍四面圍定。玄德喚張飛責之曰：「都是你奪他馬匹，惹起事端！如今馬匹在何處？」飛曰：「都寄在各寺院內。」玄德隨令人出城，至呂布營中說情，願送還馬匹，兩相罷兵。布欲從之。陳宮曰：「今不殺劉備，久後必為所害。」,"Lu Bu rode forward to give battle, and Zhang Fei advanced. A reckless fight began, and the two warriors kept it up for a hundred bouts without a decisive stroke. Then Liu Bei, fearing some accident to his brother, hastily beat the gongs as a signal to retire and led his army into the city. Lu Bu then invested it.Liu Bei called his brother and chided him as the cause of all this misfortune.""Where are the horses?"" said Liu Bei.""In some of the temples and courts,"" replied Zhang Fei.Liu Bei sent a messenger out to speak softly and offer to restore the stolen horses if hostilities were to cease. Lu Bu was disposed to agree but Chen Gong opposed.""You will suffer by and by if you do not remove this Liu Bei."""
布聽之，不從所請，攻城愈急。玄德與麋竺、孫乾商議。孫乾曰：「曹操所恨者，呂布也。不若棄城走許都，投奔曹操，借軍破布，此為上策。」玄德曰：「誰可當先破圍而出？」飛曰：「小弟情願死戰。」玄德令飛在前；雲長在後；自居其中，保護老少。當夜三更，乘著月明出北門而走，正遇宋憲、魏續，被翼德一陣殺退，得出重圍。後面張遼趕來，關公敵住。呂布見玄德去了，也不來趕，隨即入城安民，令高順守小沛，自己仍回徐州去了。,"Under Chen Gong's influence the request for peace was rejected, and the attackers on the city pressed harder.Liu Bei called Mi Zhu and Sun Qian to him to ask advice.Said Sun Qian, ""The one person that Cao Cao detests is Lu Bu. Let us then abandon the city and take refuge with Cao Cao, from whom we may borrow troops to destroy him.""""If we try to get away, who will lead the van?""""I will do my best,"" said Zhang Fei.So Zhang Fei led the way; Guan Yu was rearguard; and in the center was Liu Bei with the non-fighting portion. The cavalcade started and went out at the north gate under the bright moon. They met opposition from Song Xian and Wei Xu's men, but the soldiers were driven off by Zhang Fei, and the besieging force was passed without difficulty. Zhang Liao pursued, but was held off by Guan Yu's rearguard. It seemed Lu Bu was not dissatisfied at the flight, for he took no personal trouble to prevent it. He made formal entry into the city, settled local affairs, and appointed Gao Shun as Governor."
卻說玄德前奔許都，到城外下寨，先使孫乾來見曹操，言被呂布追迫，特來相投。操曰：「玄德與吾兄弟也。」便請入城相見。次日，玄德留關、張在城外，自帶孫乾、糜竺入見操。操待以上賓之禮。玄德備訴呂布之事。操曰：「布乃無義之輩，吾與賢弟併力誅之。」玄德稱謝。操設宴相待，至晚送出。荀彧入見曰：「劉備英雄也，今不早圖，後必為患。」,"Liu Bei approached Xuchang and encamped outside the city, whence he sent Sun Qian to see Cao Cao and relate the events that brought him there.Cao Cao was very friendly and said, ""Liu Bei is as my brother.""Then Cao Cao invited Liu Bei to enter the city.Leaving his brothers at the camp, Liu Bei, with Sun Qian and Mi Zhu, went to Cao Cao, who received him with the greatest respect. The story of Lu Bu's perfidy was again related.""He has no sense of right,"" said Cao Cao. ""You and I, my brother, will attack him together.""Liu Bei was very grateful. A banquet was then prepared, and it was late evening before the visitor left for his own camp.Xun Yu then had an interview with his master and said, ""If you are not on your guard, Liu Bei will be your undoing. You ought to destroy him. He is too much of a hero."""
操不答。彧出，郭嘉入。操曰：「荀彧勸我殺玄德，當如何？」嘉曰：「不可。主公興義兵，為百姓除暴，惟仗信義以招俊傑，猶懼其不來也；今玄德素有英雄之名，以困窮而來投，若殺之，是害賢也。天下智謀之士，聞而自疑，將裹足不前，主公與誰定天下乎？夫除一人之患，以阻四海之望，安危之機，不可不察。」,"Cao Cao made no reply and his adviser retired.Presently Guo Jia came, and Cao Cao said, ""I have been advised to kill Liu Bei: What of such a scheme?""""A bad scheme,"" said Guo Jia. ""You are the popular champion, pledged to relieve the people from oppression, and only by truth and rectitude can you secure the support of the noble-minded. Your only fear is lest they stay away. Now Liu Bei is a clear hero. He has come to you for help and protection, and to put him to death would be to alienate all good people and put fear into the hearts of all the able advisers. Hampered by these difficulties, where will you find those whose help you need? To remove the dangers represented by one man and thereby injure yourself in the eyes of all humankind is a sure means of destruction. These conditions need careful consideration."""
操大喜曰：「君言正合吾心。」次日，即表薦劉備領豫州牧。程昱諫曰：「劉備終不為人之下，不如早圖之。」操曰：「方今正用英雄之時，不可殺一人而失天下之心，此郭奉孝與吾有同見也。」遂不聽昱言，以兵三千，糧萬斛，送與玄德，使往豫州到任，進兵屯小沛，招集原散之兵，攻呂布。玄德至豫州，令人約會曹操。,"""What you say exactly fits in with what I think,"" said Cao Cao, greatly pleased with these remarks.His next step was to memorialize the Emperor to give Liu Bei the imperial protectorship of Yuzhou.Again Cheng Yu said, ""Liu Bei is certain to rise to the top. He will never remain in a subordinate position. You had better remove him.""Cao Cao answered, ""Now is just the time to make use of good people. I will not forfeit the regard of the world for the sake of removing one individual. Guo Jia and I both see this in the same light.""Wherefore Cao Cao rejected all persuasion to work against Liu Bei but sent him three thousand soldiers and ten thousand carts of grain, and set him on his way to Yuzhou. Liu Bei was to march to Xiaopei, occupy it, call together his former soldiers, and attack Lu Bu. When Liu Bei reached Yuzhou, he sent to inform Cao Cao."
操正欲起兵，自往征呂布，忽流星馬報說張濟自關中引兵攻南陽，為流矢所中而死；濟姪張繡統其眾，用賈詡為謀士，結連劉表，屯兵宛城，欲興兵犯闕奪駕。操大怒，欲興兵討之，又恐呂布來攻許都，乃問計於荀彧。彧曰：「此易事耳。呂布無謀之輩，見利必喜；明公可遣使往徐州，加官賜賞，令與玄德解和。布喜，則不思遠圖矣。」操曰：「善。」遂差奉軍都尉王則，齎官誥併和解書，往徐州去訖；一面起兵五十萬，親討張繡。分軍三路而行，以夏侯惇為先鋒。軍馬至淯水下寨。,"Cao Cao prepared to march an army to subjugate Lu Bu. But just then hasty news came that Zhang Ji, who had gone to the attack of Nanyang, had been wounded by a stray arrow and had died. His nephew, Zhang Xiu, had succeeded to the command of his army; and with Jia Xu as strategist, Zhang Xiu had joined Liu Biao and camped at Wancheng. They intended to attack the capital and get possession of the Emperor's person.Cao Cao was placed in a quandary. He would go to attack this combination, but he feared lest Lu Bu would attack the capital if he left it. So he sought the advice of Xun Yu.Said the Adviser, ""Lu Bu has no notion of a policy. He is led astray by any little advantage that presents itself to his eyes. All you need do is to obtain promotion for him, giving him some additional title, and tell him to make peace with Liu Bei, and he will do it. Lu Bu is no threat then.""""Good,"" said Cao Cao.And he acted upon the hint and sent an Imperial Legate, Wang Ze, to Xuzhou with the official announcement and a letter urging peace, while he went on with preparations to meet the other danger from Zhang Xiu.When ready Cao Cao marched out with one hundred fifty thousand troops in three divisions. Xiahou Dun was the Van Leader, and they went to River Yu and camped there."
賈詡勸張繡曰：「操兵勢大，不可與敵，不如舉城投降。」張繡從之，使賈詡至操寨通款。操見詡應對如流，甚愛之，欲用為謀士。詡曰：「某昔從李榷，得罪天下；今從張繡，言聽計從，未忍棄之。」乃辭去。次日引繡來見操，操待之甚厚。引兵入宛城屯紮，餘軍分屯城外，寨柵聯絡十餘里。一住數日。繡每日設宴請操。一日操醉，退入寢所，私問左右曰：「此城中有妓女否？」操之兄子曹安民，知操意，乃密對曰：「昨晚小姪兒窺見館舍之側，有一婦人，生得十分美麗。問之，即繡叔張濟之妻也。」,"Jia Xu succeeded in persuading Zhang Xiu of the hopelessness of resistance.""You would do well to surrender, since Cao Cao's army is too large for you to oppose,"" said Jia Xu.Seeing the truth of this, Zhang Xiu sent his adviser to propose sub mission. Cao Cao was greatly pleased with the messenger, admiring his ready and fluent repartee, and tried to win him to his service.""I was formerly with Li Jue and was guilty with him. Now I am with Zhang Xiu who esteems my advice, and I should not like to abandon him,"" said Jia Xu.Jia Xu left and next day conducted his master into Cao Cao's presence. Cao Cao was very generous. Then he entered Wancheng with a small force, the greater part of the army being put in camp outside where the lines extended some three miles. Great banquets were given every day by Zhang Xiu, and Cao Cao was always being entertained.One day, when Cao Cao returned to his quarters in a more than usual merry mood, he asked the attendants, ""Are there singing girls in the city?""His nephew, Cao Anmin, heard the question and said, ""Peeping through one of the partitions last evening, I saw a perfectly beautiful woman in one of the courts. They told me she was the wife of Zhang Ji, Zhang Xiu's uncle. She is very lovely."""
操聞言，便令安民領五十甲兵往取之。須臾，取到軍中。操見之，果然美麗。問其姓名，婦答曰：「妾乃張濟之妻鄒氏也。」操曰：「夫人識吾否？」鄒氏曰：「久聞丞相威名，今夕幸得瞻拜。」操曰：「吾為夫人，故特納張繡之降；不然滅族矣。」鄒氏拜曰：「實感再生之恩。」操曰：「今日得見夫人，乃天幸也。今宵願同枕席，隨吾還都，安享富貴，何如？」,"Cao Cao, inflamed by the description given him of the beauty, told his nephew to go and bring her to visit him. Cao Anmin did so, supported by an armed escort, and very soon the woman stood before Cao Cao.She was a beauty indeed, and Cao Cao asked her name.She replied, ""Thy handmaid was wife to Zhang Ji; I was born of the Zhou family.""""Do you know who I am?""""I have known the Prime Minister by reputation a long time. I am happy to see him and be permitted to bow before him,"" said she.""It was for your sake that I allowed Zhang Xiu to submit; otherwise I would have slain him and cut him off root and branch,"" said Cao Cao.""Indeed, then, I owe my very life to you; I am very grateful,"" said she.""To see you is a glimpse of paradise, but there is one thing I should like better. I hope, this night, we can share the same pillow together, and tomorrow go with me to the capital where we can enjoy all the luxuries of life. What do you say to that, my lady?"""
鄒氏拜謝。是夜共宿於帳中。鄒氏曰：「久住城中，繡必生疑，亦恐外人議論。」操曰：「明日同夫人寨中去住。」次日，移于城外安歇，喚典韋就中軍帳房外宿衛。他人非奉呼喚，不許輒入，因此內外不通。操每日與鄒氏取樂，不想歸期。張繡家人密報繡。繡怒曰：「操賊辱我太甚！」便請賈詡商議。詡曰：「此事不可洩漏。來日等操出帳議事，如此如此。」,"She could but thank him. ""But Zhang Xiu will greatly wonder at my prolonged absence, and gossips will begin to talk,"" said she.""If you like, you can leave the city tomorrow.""She did so; but instead of going at once to the capital, she stayed with him among the tents, where Dian Wei was appointed as a special guard over her apartments. Cao Cao was the only person whom she saw, and he passed the days in idle dalliance with the lady, quite content to let time flow by.But people told Zhang Xiu what had gone amiss, and he was angry at the shame brought upon the family.He confided his trouble to Jia Xu who said, ""Keep this secret, wait till he appears again to carry on business, and then do so and so.""A plan was arranged quite secretly."
次日，操在帳中，張繡入告曰：「新降兵多有逃亡者，乞移屯中軍。」操許之，繡乃移屯其軍，分為四寨，刻期舉事。因畏典韋勇猛，急切難近，乃與偏將胡車兒商議。那胡車兒力能負五百斤，日行七百里，亦異人也。當下獻計于繡曰：「典韋之可畏者，雙鐵戟耳。主公明日可請他來吃酒，使盡醉而歸。那時某便溷入他跟來軍士數內，偷入帳房，盜其戟，此人不足畏矣。」,"Next day Zhang Xiu went into Cao Cao's tent, saying, ""Since the surrendered troops are deserting in great number, it would be well to camp them in the center of your camp to prevent this.""Cao Cao gave the permission, and Zhang Xiu moved and placed his army in four camps.But Dian Wei, the especial guard of Cao Cao's tent, was a man to be feared, being both brave and powerful. It was hard to know how to attack him. So counsel was taken with Hu Che'er, the commander of one camp and a man of enormous strength and activity. He could carry a burden of six hundred pounds and two hundred miles in a day. Hu Che'er proposed a plan.He said, ""The fearsome thing about Dian Wei is his double halberds. But get him to come to a party and make him quite drunk before you send him back. I will mingle among his escort and so get into his tent and steal away his weapons. One needs not fear him then."""
繡甚喜，預先準備弓箭甲兵，告示各寨。至期令賈詡致意請典韋到寨，殷勤待酒。至晚醉歸，胡車兒雜在眾人隊裡，直入大寨。是夜曹操于帳中，與鄒氏飲酒。忽聽帳外人言馬嘶，操使人觀之。回報是張繡軍夜巡，操乃不疑。時近二更，忽聞寨後吶喊。報說草車上火起。操曰：「軍中失火，勿得驚動。」,"So the necessary arms were prepared and orders given in the various camps. This done Zhang Xiu gave a banquet, and the intended victim was invited and plied vigorously with wine so that he was quite intoxicated when he left. And, as arranged, Hu Che'er mingled with his escort and made away with his weapons.That night, when Cao Cao was at supper with Lady Zhou, he heard the voices of men and neighing of horses and sent out to ask what it meant. They told him it was the night patrol going the rounds, and he was satisfied.Near the second watch of the night again was heard some noise in the rear of his tent, and one of the fodder carts was reported to be burning.""One of the soldiers has dropped a spark; there is nothing to be alarmed at,"" said Cao Cao."
須臾，四下裏火起，操始著忙，急喚典韋。韋方醉臥，睡夢中聽得金鼓喊殺之聲，便跳起身來，卻尋不見了雙戟。時敵兵已到轅門，韋急掣步卒腰刀在手。只見門首無數軍馬，各挺長鎗，搶入寨來。韋奮力向前，砍死二十餘人。軍馬方退，步軍又到，兩邊槍如葦列。韋身無片甲，上下被數十鎗，兀自死戰。刀砍缺不堪用，韋即棄刀，雙手提著兩個軍人迎敵，擊死者八九人。群賊不敢近，只遠遠以箭射之。箭如驟雨，韋猶死拒寨門。爭奈寨後賊軍以入，韋背上又中一槍，乃大叫數聲。血流滿地而死。死了半晌，還無一人敢從前門而入者。,"But very soon the fire spread on all sides and became alarming. Cao Cao called Dian Wei. But he, usually so alert, was lying down quite intoxicated.However, the beating of gongs and rolling of drums mingling with his dreams awoke Dian Wei, and he jumped up. His trusty halberds had disappeared. The enemy was near. He hastily snatched up an infantryman's sword and rushed out. At the gate he saw a crowd of spearmen just bursting in. Dian Wei rushed at them slashing all around him, and twenty or more fell beneath his blows. The others drew back. But the spears stood around him like reeds on the river bank. Being totally without mail, he was soon wounded in several places. He fought desperately till his sword snapped and was no longer of any use. Throwing it aside he seized a couple of soldiers and with their bodies as weapons felled ten of his opponents. The others dared not approach, but they shot arrows at him. These fell thick as rain, but he still maintained the gate against the assailants.However, the mutineers got in by the rear of the camp, and they wounded Dian Wei in the back with spear thrusts. Uttering a loud cry he fell. The blood gushed from the wound in torrents, and he died. Even after he was dead not a man dared to come in by the main gate."
卻說曹操賴典韋當住寨門，乃得從寨後上馬逃奔，只有曹安民步隨，操右臂中了一箭，馬亦中了三箭。虧得那馬是大宛良馬，熬得痛，走得快。剛剛走到淯水河邊，賊兵追至，安民被砍為肉泥。操急驟馬衝波過河，纔上得岸，賊兵一箭射來，正中馬眼，那馬撲地倒了。操長子曹昂，即以己所乘之馬奉操。操上馬急奔。曹昂卻被亂箭射死。操乃走脫。路逢諸將，收集殘兵。,"Cao Cao, relying on Dian Wei to hold the main gate, had fled in haste by the rear gate. Cao Anmin accompanied him on foot. Then Cao Cao was wounded by an arrow in the arm, and three arrows struck his horse. However, fortunately, the horse was a fine Dawan beast full of spirit and, in spite of its wounds, it bore its master swiftly and well as far as the bank of River Yu.Here some of the pursuers came up, and Cao Anmin was hacked to pieces. Cao Cao dashed into the river and reached the further side, but there an arrow struck his steed in the eye and it fell. Cao Cao's eldest son, Cao Ang, dismounted and yielded his horse to his father, who galloped on. Cao Ang was killed by arrows, but Cao Cao himself got away. Soon after he met several of his officers who had rallied a few troops."
時夏侯惇所領青州之兵，乘勢下鄉，劫掠民家；平虜校尉于禁，即將本部軍于路剿殺，安撫鄉民。青州兵走回，迎操泣拜于地，言于禁造反，趕殺青州軍馬。操大驚。須臾，夏侯惇、許褚、李典樂進都到。操言于禁造反，可整兵迎之。,"The soldiers of Qingzhou under Xiahou Dun seized the occasion to plunder the people. Yu Jin took his army, fell upon them, and slew many. Thus he protected and appeased the people. The plunderers, meeting Cao Cao on the road, knelt down howling and said Yu Jin had mutinied and attacked them. Cao Cao was surprised, and he gave order to Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Li Dian, and Yue Jin to attack Yu Jin."
卻說于禁見操等俱到，乃引軍射住陣角，鑿塹安營。,"Now when Yu Jin saw his master and a great company approaching, he at once stopped the attack and set his troops to make a camp."
告之曰：「青州軍言將軍造反，今丞相已到，何不分辯，乃先立營寨耶？」于禁曰：「今賊追兵在後，不時即至；若不先準備，何以拒敵？分辯小事，退敵大事。」安營方畢，張繡軍兩路殺至。于禁身先出寨迎敵。繡急退兵。左右諸將，見于禁向前，各引兵擊之，繡軍大敗，追殺百餘里。繡勢窮力孤，引敗兵投劉表去了。,"An officer asked him, ""The Qingzhou soldiers say you have turned traitor. Why do you not explain now that the Prime Minister has arrived? Why first make a camp?""Yu Jin replied, ""Our enemies are coming up in our rear and are very close. It is necessary to prepare for defense or we shall not withstand them. Explanation is a small matter, but defense is very important.""Soon after the camp was finished, Zhang Xiu fell upon them. Yu Jin himself rode out to face them. Zhang Xiu drew back. The other generals of Yu Jin, seeing he advance thus boldly, also attacked, and Zhang Xiu was overcome. They pursued him a great distance until his force was almost annihilated. With the miserable remnant he finally fled to Liu Biao."
曹操收軍點將，于禁入見，備言青州之兵，肆行劫掠，大失民望，某故殺之。操曰：「不告我，先下寨，何也？」禁以前言對。操曰：「將軍在匆忙之中，能整兵堅壘，任謗任勞，使反敗為勝，雖古之名將，何以加茲！」乃賜以金器一副，封益壽亭侯；青夏侯惇治兵不嚴之過；又設祭，祭典韋。操親自哭而奠之，顧謂諸將曰：「吾折長子、愛姪，俱無深痛；獨號泣典韋也。」眾皆感歎。次日下令班師。,"Cao Cao's army reformed, and the commanders mustered. Then Yu Jin went to see his master and told him of the conduct of the Qingzhou soldiers and their looting and why he had attacked them.""Why did you not tell me before you made the camp?""Yu Jin related what had occurred.Said Cao Cao, ""When the first thought of a leader in the time of greatest stress is to maintain order and to strengthen his defenses, giving no thought to slander but shouldering his burdens bravely, and when he thereby turns a defeat into a victory, who, even of the ancient leaders, can excel Yu Jin?""Cao Cao rewarded Yu Jin with a golden armor and the lordship of Yishou. But Cao Cao reprimanded Xiahou Dun for the lack of discipline among his soldiers.Sacrifices in honor of the dead warrior Dian Wei were instituted. Cao Cao himself led the wailing and paid due honors.Turning to his officers he said, ""I have lost my first born son, but I grieve not so heavily for him as for Dian Wei. I weep for him!""All were sad at the loss of this general."
不說曹操還兵許都。且說王則齎詔至徐州，布迎接入府，開讀詔書，─封布為平東將軍，特賜印綬。─又出操私書。王則在呂布面前，極道曹公相敬之意。布大喜。忽報袁術遣人至，布喚入問之。使言：「袁公早晚即皇帝位，立東宮，催取皇妃早到淮南。」布大怒曰：「反賊焉敢如此！」遂殺來使，將韓胤用枷釘了，遣陳登齎謝表，解韓胤一同王則上許都來謝恩；且答書于操，欲求實授徐州牧。,"Then orders were issued to return to the capital.When Imperial Legate Wang Ze, bearing the imperial decree, reached Xuzhou, he was met by Lu Bu, who conducted him into the residence where the decree was read. It conferred Lu Bu the title General Who Pacifies the East, and a special seal accompanied the mandate. The private mediating letter was also handed over and the messenger detailed the high appreciation in which Lu Bu was held by the Chief Minister of State. Lu Bu was greatly pleased.Next came news that a messenger from Yuan Shu had arrived.When he had been introduced, he said, ""My master's project of declaring himself emperor is advancing. He has already built a Palace and will speedily choose Empress and concubines and would come to the South of River Huai. He is looking forward to receiving the fiancee of the Heir Apparent.""""Has the rebel gone so far?"" cried Lu Bu in a rage.He put the messenger to death and Han Yin into the cage. He drafted a memorial of thanks and sent it to the capital, at the same time sending, too, Han Yin, the unfortunate agent who had arranged the marriage alliance. He also replied to Cao Cao's private meditating letter asking to be confirmed in his protectorship of Xuzhou. The letter was sent by the hand of Chen Deng."
操知布絕婚袁術，大喜，遂斬韓胤于市曹。陳登密諫操曰：「呂布豺狼也，勇而無謀，輕於去就，宜早圖之。」操曰：「吾素知呂布狼子野心，誠難久養。非公父子莫能究其情，公當與吾謀之。」登曰：「丞相若有舉動，某當為內應。」操大喜，表贈陳珪治中二千石，登為廣陵太守。登辭回，操執登手曰：「東方之事，便以相付。」,"Cao Cao was pleased to hear of the rupture of the marriage arrangement between the houses of Yuans and Lus, and forthwith put Han Yin to death in the market place.However, Chen Deng secretly told Cao Cao, saying, ""Lu Bu is cruel, stupid, and facile. The longer he remains, the worse.""""I know Lu Bu quite well,"" replied Cao Cao. ""He is a wolf with a savage heart, and it will be hard to feed him for long. If it had not been for you and your father, I should not have known all the circumstances and you must help me to get rid of him.""""Anything the Prime Minister wishes to do shall have my assistance,"" was the reply.As a reward Cao Cao obtained an annually grant of two thousand carts of grain for Chen Gui and the governorship of Guangling for Chen Deng, who then took his leave.As he was saying farewell, Cao Cao took him by the hand, saying, ""I shall depend upon you in the eastern affairs."""
登點頭允諾，回徐州見呂布。布問之，登言父贈祿，某為太守。布大怒曰：「汝不為吾求徐州牧，而乃自求爵祿！汝父教我協同曹公，絕婚公路，今吾所求，終無一獲，而汝父子俱各顯貴，吾為汝父子所賣耳！」遂拔劍欲斬之。登大笑曰：「將軍何其不明之甚也！」布曰：「吾何不明？」登曰：「吾見曹公，言養將軍譬如養虎，當飽其肉；不飽則將噬人。」曹公笑曰：「不如卿言。吾待溫侯，如養鷹耳，狐兔未息，不敢先飽。饑則為用，飽則颺去。」某問：「誰為狐兔？」曹公曰：「淮南袁術、江東孫策、冀州袁紹、荊州劉表、益州劉璋、漢中張魯，皆狐兔也。」布擲劍笑曰：「曹公知我也！」正說話間，忽報袁術軍來取徐州。呂布聞言失驚。正是：秦晉未諧吳越鬥，婚姻惹出甲兵來。畢竟後事如何。且看下文分解。,"Chen Deng nodded acquiescence. Then he returned to Lu Bu, who asked him how the visit was.Chen Deng told him, ""My father received a generous annuity, and I was made Governor of Guangling.""Lu Bu enraged, saying, ""You did not ask Xuzhou for me, but you got something for yourself. Your father advised me to help Cao Cao by breaking off the marriage, and now I get nothing at all of what I asked, while you and your father get everything. I have been victimized by your father.""He threatened Chen Deng with his sword.Chen Deng only laughed, saying, ""O General, how unwary you are!""""I, unwary?""""When I saw Cao Cao, I said that to keep you going was like feeding a tiger. The tiger must be kept fully fed or he would eat humans. But Cao Cao laughed and replied, 'No, not that. One must treat the Commander like a falcon. Not feed it till the foxes and hares are done. Hungry, the bird is of use; full fed it flies away.' I asked who were the quarry. He replied, 'Yuan Shu of the South of River Huai, Sun Ce of the South Land, Yuan Shao of Jizhou, Liu Biao of Jingzhou, Liu Zhang of Yizhou, and Zhang Lu of Hanzhong; these are the foxes and hares.'""Lu Bu threw aside his sword and laughed, saying, ""Yes, he understands me!""But just about that time came news of the advance of Yuan Shu on Xuzhou, and that frightened Lu Bu.When discord rose between Qin and Jin,They were attacked by Yue and Wu,And when a promised bride never came,An army marched to enforce the claim.How all this fell out will be shown in the next chapter."
