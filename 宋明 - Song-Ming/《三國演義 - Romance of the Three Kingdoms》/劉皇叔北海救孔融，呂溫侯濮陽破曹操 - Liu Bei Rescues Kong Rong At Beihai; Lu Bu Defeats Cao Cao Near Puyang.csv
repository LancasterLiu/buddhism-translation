卻說獻計之人，乃東海朐縣人：姓糜，名竺，字子仲。此人家世富豪。嘗往洛陽買賣，乘車而回，路遇一美婦人，來求同載，竺乃下車步行，讓車與婦人坐。婦人請竺同載。竺上車端坐，目不邪視。行及數里，婦人辭去；臨別對竺曰：「我乃南方火德星君也，奉上帝敕，往燒汝家。感君相待以禮，故明告君。君可速歸，搬出財物。吾當夜來。」言訖不見。竺大驚，飛奔到家，將家中所有，疾忙搬出。是晚果然廚中火起，盡燒其屋。竺因此廣捨家財，濟貧拔苦。後陶謙聘為別駕從事。當日獻計曰：「某願親往北海郡，求孔融起兵救援；更得一人往青州田楷處求救：若二處軍馬齊來，操必退兵矣。」,"It was one Mi Zhu who said he knew how to defeat Cao Cao utterly. Mi Zhu came of a wealthy family of merchants in Donghai and trading in Luoyang. One day traveling homeward from that city in a carriage, he met an exquisitely beautiful lady trudging along the road, who asked him to let her ride. He stopped and yielded his place to her. She invited him to share the seat with her. He mounted, but sat rigidly upright, never even glancing in her direction. They traveled thus for some miles when she thanked him and alighted.Just as she left she said, ""I am the Goddess of Fire from the Southern Land. I am on my way to execute a decree of the Supreme God to burn your dwelling, but your extreme courtesy has so deeply touched me that I now warn you. Hasten homeward, remove your valuables, for I must arrive tonight.""Thereupon she disappeared. Mi Zhu hastily finished his journey and, as soon as he arrived, moved everything out of his house. Sure enough that night a fire started in the kitchen and involved the whole house. After this he devoted his wealth to relieving the poor and comforting the afflicted. Tao Qian gave him the magistracy office he then held.The plan Mi Zhu proposed was this: ""I will go to Beihai and beg Governor Kong Rong to help. Another should go to Qingzhou on a similar mission to get the help from Imperial Protector Tian Kai. If the armies of these two places march on Cao Cao, he will certainly retire."""
謙從之，遂寫書二封，問帳下誰人敢去青州求救。一人應聲願往。眾視之，乃廣陵人：姓陳，名登，字元龍。陶謙先打發陳元龍往青州去訖，然後命糜竺齎書赴北海，自己率眾守城，以備攻擊。,"Tao Qian accepted the plan and wrote two letters. He asked for a volunteer to go to Qingzhou, and a certain Chen Deng of Guangling offered himself and, after he had left, Mi Zhu was formally entrusted with the mission to the north. Meanwhile Tao Qian and his generals would hold the city as they could."
卻說北海孔融，字文舉，魯國曲阜人也；孔子二十世孫，泰山都尉孔宙之子。自小聰明。年十歲時，往謁河南尹李膺，閽人難之，融曰：「我係李相通家。」及入見，膺問曰：「汝祖與吾祖何親？」融曰：「昔孔子曾問禮於老子，融與君豈非累世通家？」膺大奇之。,"Kong Rong was a native of Qufu in the old state of Lu. He was one of the twentieth generation in descent from the great Teacher Confucius (Kong Fuzi). Kong Rong had been noted as a very intelligent lad, somewhat precocious. When ten years old he had gone to see Li Ying, the Governor of Henan, but the doorkeeper demurred to letting him in.But when Kong Rong said, ""I am Minister Li Ying's intimate friend,"" he was admitted.Li Ying asked Kong Rong what relations had existed between their families that might justify the term intimate.The boy replied, ""Of old my ancestor Confucius questioned your ancestor, the Daoist sage Laozi, concerning ceremonies. So our families have known each other for many generations.""Li Ying was astonished at the boy's ready wit."
少頃，太中大夫陳煒至。膺指融曰：「此奇童也。」煒曰：「小時聰明，大時未必聰明。」融即應聲曰：「如君所言，幼時必聰明者。」煒等皆笑曰：「此子長成，必當代之偉器也。」自此得名。後為中郎將，累遷北海太守。極好賓客，常曰：「座上客常滿，樽中酒不空：吾之願也。」在北海六年，甚得民心。,"Presently High Minister Chen Wei visited, to whom Li Ying told the story of his youthful guest. ""He is a wonder, this boy,"" said Li Ying, pointing to Kong Rong.Chen Wei replied, ""It does not follow that a clever boy grows up into a clever man.""The lad took him up at once, saying, ""By what you say, Sir, you were certainly one of the clever boys.""The Minister and the Governor all laughed, saying, ""The boy is going to be a noble vessel.""Thus from boyhood Kong Rong was famous. As a man he rose to be an Imperial Commander and was sent as Governor to Beihai, where he was renowned for hospitality. He used to quote the lines:""Let the rooms be full of friends,And the cups be full of wine.That is what I like.""After six years at Beihai the people were devoted to him."
當日正與客坐，人報徐州糜竺至。融請入見，問其來意，竺出陶謙書，言：「曹操攻圍甚急，望明公垂救。」融曰：「吾與陶恭祖交厚，子仲又親到此，如何不去。只是曹孟德與我無讎，當先遣人送書解和。如其不從，然後起兵。」竺曰：「曹操倚仗兵威，決不肯和。」融教一面點兵，一面差人送書。正商議間，忽報黃巾賊黨管亥部領群寇數萬殺奔前來。孔融大驚，急點本部人馬，出城與賊迎戰。管亥出馬曰：「吾知北海糧廣，可借一萬石，即便退兵；不然，打破城池老幼不留！」孔融叱曰：「吾乃大漢之臣，守大漢之地，豈有糧米與賊耶！」管亥大怒，拍馬舞刀，直取孔融。融將宗寶挺鎗出馬；戰不數合，被管亥一刀，砍宗寶於馬下。孔融兵大亂，奔入城中。管亥分兵四面圍城，孔融心中鬱悶。糜竺懷愁，更不待言。,"The day that Mi Zhu arrived, Kong Rong was, as usual, seated among his guests, and the messenger was ushered in without delay. In reply to a question about the reason of the visit, Mi Zhu presented Tao Qian's letter which said that Cao Cao was pressing on Xuzhou City and the Imperial Protector prayed for help.Then said Kong Rong, ""Your master and I are good friends, and your presence here constrains me to go to his aid. However, I have no quarrel with Cao Cao either, so I will first write to him to try to make peace. If he refuses my offer, then I must set the army in motion.""""Cao Cao will not listen to proposals of peace: He is too certain of his strength,"" said Mi Zhu.Kong Rong wrote his letter and also gave orders to muster his troops. Just at this moment happened another rising of the Yellow Scarves, ten thousand of them, and the ruffians began to rob and murder at Beihai. It was necessary to deal with them first, and Kong Rong led his army outside the city.The rebel leader, Guan Hai, rode out to the front, saying, ""I know this county is fruitful and can well spare ten thousand carts of grain. Give me that and we retire; refuse, and we will batter down the city walls and destroy every soul!""Kong Rong shouted back, ""I am a servant of the great Hans, entrusted with the safety of their land. Think you I will feed rebels?""Guan Hai whipped his steed, whirled his sword around his head, and rode forward. Zong Bao, one of Kong Rong's generals, set his spear and rode out to give battle, but after a very few bouts Zong Bao was cut down. Soon the soldiers fell into panic and rushed pell-mell into the city for protection. The rebels then laid siege to the city on all sides. Kong Rong was very down-hearted; and Mi Zhu, who now saw no hope for the success of his mission, was grieved beyond words."
次日，孔融登城遙望，賊勢浩大，倍添憂惱。忽見城外一人挺鎗躍馬殺入賊陣，左衝右突，如入無人之境，直到城下大叫：「開門！」孔融不識其人，不敢開門。賊眾趕到河邊，那人回身連搠十數人下馬，賊眾倒退，融急命開門引入。其人下馬棄鎗，逕到城上，拜見孔融。融問其姓名對曰：「某東萊黃縣人也：覆姓太史，名慈，字子義。老母重蒙恩顧。某昨自遼東回家省親，知賊寇城，老母說：『屢受府君深恩，汝當往救。』某故單馬而來。」孔融大喜。原來孔融與太史慈，雖未識面，卻曉得他是個英雄。因他遠出，有老母住在離城二十里之外，融常使人遣以粟帛；母感融德，故特使慈來救。,"The sight from the city wall was exceeding sad, for the rebels were there in enormous numbers. One day standing on the wall, Kong Rong saw afar a man armed with a spear riding hard in among the Yellow Scarves and scattering them before him like chaff before the wind.Before long the man had reached the foot of the wall and called out, ""Open the gate!""But the defenders would not open to an unknown man, and in the delay a crowd of rebels gathered round the rider along the edge of the moat. Suddenly wheeling about, the warrior dashed in among them and bowled over a dozen at which the others fell back. At this Kong Rong ordered the wardens to open the gates and let the stranger enter. As soon as he was inside, he dismounted, laid aside his spear, ascended the wall, and made humble obeisance to the Governor.""My name is Taishi Ci, and I am from the county of Laihuang. I only returned home yesterday from the north to see my mother, and then I heard that your city was in danger from a rebel attack. My mother said you had been very kind to her and told me I should try to help. So I set out all alone, and here I am.""This was cheering. Kong Rong already knew Taishi Ci by reputation as a valiant fighting man, although they two had never met. The son being far away from his home, Kong Rong had taken his mother, who dwelt a few miles from the city, under his especial protection and saw that she did not suffer from want. This had won the old lady's heart and she had sent her son to show her gratitude."
當下孔融重待太史慈，贈與衣甲鞍馬。慈曰：「某願借精兵一千，出城殺賊。」融曰：「君雖英勇，然賊勢甚盛，不可輕出。」慈曰：「老母感君厚德，特遣慈來；如不能解圍，慈亦無顏見母矣。願決一死戰。」融曰：「吾聞劉玄德乃當世英雄，若請得他來相救此圍自解；只無人可使耳。」慈曰：「府君修書，某當急往。」融喜，修書付慈。慈擐甲上馬，腰帶弓矢，手時鐵鎗，飽食嚴裝，城門開處，一騎飛出。近河，賊將率眾來戰，慈連搠死數人，透圍而出。管亥知有人出城，料必是請救兵的，便自引數百騎趕來，八面圍定。慈倚住鎗，拈弓搭箭，八面射之，無不應弦落馬。賊眾不敢來追。,"Kong Rong showed his appreciation by treating his guest with the greatest respect, making him presents of clothing and armor, saddles and horses.Presently said Taishi Ci, ""Give me a thousand soldiers, and I will go out and drive off these fellows.""""You are a bold warrior, but they are very numerous. It is a serious matter to go out among them,"" said Kong Rong.""My mother sent me because of your goodness to her. How shall I be able to look her in the face if I do not raise the siege? I would prefer to conquer or perish.""""I have heard Liu Bei is one of the heroes in the world. If we could get his help, there would be no doubt of the result. But there is no one to send.""""I will go as soon as I have received your letter!""So Kong Rong wrote letters and gave them to his helper.Taishi Ci put on his armor, mounted his steed, attached his bow and quiver to his girdle, took his spear in his hand, tied his packed haversack firmly to his saddle bow, and rode out at the city gate. He went quite alone.Along the moat a large party of the besiegers were gathered, and they came to intercept the solitary rider. But Taishi Ci dashed in among them and cut down several and so finally fought his way through.Guan Hai, hearing that a rider had left the city, guessed what his errand would be and followed Taishi Ci with a party of horsemen. Guan Hai spread them out so that the messenger rider was entirely surrounded. Then Taishi Ci laid aside his spear, took his bow, adjusted his arrows one by one and shot all round him. And as a rider fell from his steed with every twang of Taishi Ci's bowstring, the pursuers dared not close in."
太史慈得脫，星夜投平原來見劉玄德。施禮罷，具言孔北海被圍求救之事，呈上書札。玄德看畢，問慈曰：「足下何人？」慈曰：「某太史慈，東海之鄙人也。與孔融親非骨肉，比非鄉黨，特以氣誼相投，有分憂共患之意。今管亥暴亂，北海被圍，孤窮無告，危在旦夕。聞君仁義素著，能救人危急，故特令某冒鋒突圍，前來求救。」玄德斂容答曰：「孔北海知世間有劉備耶？」乃同雲長、翼德點精兵三千，往北海郡進發。,"Thus he got clear away and rode in hot haste to Liu Bei. Taishi Ci reached Pingyuan, and after greeting his host in proper form he told how Kong Rong was surrounded and had sent him for help. Then he presented the letter which Liu Bei read.""And who are you?"" asked Liu Bei.""I am Taishi Ci, a fellow from Laihuang. I am not related by ties of kin to Kong Rong, nor even by ties of neighborhood, but I am by the bonds of sentiment and I share his sorrows and misfortunes. The Yellow Scarves have invested his city, and he is distressed with none to turn to, and destruction is very near. You are known as humane, righteous, and eager to help the distressed. Therefore at his command I have braved all dangers and fought my way through his enemies to pray you save him.""Liu Bei smiled and sighed, saying, ""And does he know there is a Liu Bei in this world?""So Liu Bei, together with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, told off three thousand troops and set out to help raise the siege."
管亥望見救軍來到，親自引兵迎敵；因見玄德兵少，不以為意。玄德與關、張、太史慈立馬陣前，管亥忿怒直出。太史慈卻待向前，雲長早出，直取管亥。兩馬相交，眾軍大喊；量管亥怎敵得雲長，數十合之間，青龍刀起，劈管亥於馬下。太史慈，張飛，兩騎齊出，雙槍並舉，殺入賊陣。玄德驅兵掩殺。城上孔融望見太史慈與關、張趕殺賊眾，如虎入羊群，縱橫莫當，便驅兵出城。兩下夾攻，大敗群賊，降者無數，餘黨潰散。,"When the rebel leader Guan Hai saw these new forces arriving, he led out his army to fight them, thinking he could easily dispose of so small a force. The brothers and Taishi Ci with them sat on their horses in the forefront of their array. Guan Hai hastened forward. Taishi Ci was ready to fight, but Guan Yu had opened the combat. He rode forth and the two steeds met. The soldiers set up a great noise. After a few bouts Guan Yu's green-dragon saber rose and fell, and with the stroke fell the rebel leader.This was the signal for Zhang Fei and Taishi Ci to take a share, and they advanced side by side. With their spears ready they dashed in, and Liu Bei urged forward his force. The besieged Governor saw his doughty rescuers laying low the rebels as tigers among a flock of sheep. None could withstand them, and he then sent out his own troops to join in the battle so that the rebels were between two armies. The rebels' force was completely broken and many troops surrendered, while the remainder scattered in all directions."
孔融迎接玄德入城，敘禮畢，大設筵宴慶賀。又引糜竺出見玄德，具言張闓殺曹嵩之事：「今曹操縱兵大掠，圍住徐州，特來求救。」玄德曰：「陶恭祖乃仁人君子，不意受此無辜之冤。」孔融曰：「公乃漢室宗親，今曹操殘害百姓，倚強欺弱，何不與融同往救之？」玄德曰：「備非敢推辭，奈兵微將寡，恐難輕動。」孔融曰：「融之欲救陶恭祖，雖因舊誼，亦為大義。公豈獨無仗義之心耶？」玄德曰：「既如此，請文舉先行，容備去公孫瓚處，借三五千人馬，隨後便來。」融曰：「公切勿失信。」玄德曰：「公以備為何如人也？聖人云：『自古皆有死，人無信不立。』劉備借得軍，或借不得軍，必然親至。」,"The victors were welcomed into the city, and as soon as possible a banquet was prepared in their honor. Mi Zhu was presented to Liu Bei. Mi Zhu related the story of the murder of Cao Song by Zhang Kai, Cao Cao's vengeful attack on Xuzhou, and his coming to beg for assistance.Liu Bei said, ""Imperial Protector Tao Qian is a kindly man of high character, and it is a pity that he should suffer this wrong for no fault of his own.""""You are a scion of the imperial family,"" said Governor Kong Rong, ""and this Cao Cao is injuring the people, a strong man abusing his strength. Why not go with me to rescue the sufferers?""""I dare not refuse, but my force is weak and I must act cautiously,"" said Liu Bei.""Though my desire to help arises from an old friendship, yet it is a righteous act as well. I do not think your heart is not inclined toward the right,"" said Kong Rong.Liu Bei said, ""This being so, you go first and give me time to see Gongsun Zan from whom I may borrow more troops and horses. I will come anon.""""You surely will not break your promise?"" said the Governor.""What manner of man think you that I am?"" said Liu Bei. ""The Sage said, 'Death is common to all; the person without truth cannot maintain the self.' Whether I get the troops or not, certainly I shall come myself."""
孔融應允；教糜竺先回徐州去報，融便收拾起程。太史慈拜謝曰：「慈奉母命前來相助，今幸無虞。有揚州刺史劉繇，與慈同郡，有書來喚，不敢不去。容圖再見。」融以金帛相酬，慈不肯受而歸。其母見之，喜曰：「我喜汝有以報北海也！」遂遣慈往揚州去了。,"So the plan was agreed to. Mi Zhu set out to return forthwith while Kong Rong prepared for his expedition.Taishi Ci took his leave, saying, ""My mother bade me come to your aid, and now happily you are safe. Letters have come from my fellow townsman, Liu Yao, Imperial Protector of Yangzhou, calling me thither and I must go. I will see you again.""Kong Rong pressed rewards upon Taishi Ci, but he would accept nothing and departed.When his mother saw him, she was pleased at his success, saying, ""I rejoice that you have been able to prove your gratitude!""After this he departed for Yangzhou."
不說孔融起兵。且說玄德離北海來見公孫瓚，且說欲救徐州之事。瓚曰：「曹操與君無讎，何苦替人出力？」玄德曰：「備已許人，不敢失信。」瓚曰：「我借與君馬步軍二千。」玄德曰：「更望借趙子龍一行。」瓚許之。玄德遂與關、張引本部三千人為前部，子龍引二千人隨後，往徐州來。,"Liu Bei went away to his friend Gongsun Zan and laid before Gongsun Zan his design to help Xuzhou.""Cao Cao and you are not enemies. Why do you spend yourself for the sake of another?"" said Gongsun Zan.""I have promised,"" Liu Bei replied, ""and dare not break faith.""""I will lend you two thousand horse and foot,"" said Gongsun Zan.""Also, I wish to have the services of Zhao Zilong,"" said Liu Bei.Gongsun Zan agreed to this also. They marched away, Liu Bei's own troops being in the front, and Zhao Zilong, with the borrowed troops, being in rear."
卻說糜竺回報陶謙，言北海又請得劉玄德來助；陳元龍也回報青州田楷欣然領兵來救；陶謙心安。原來孔融、田楷兩路軍馬，懼怕曹兵勢猛，遠遠依山下寨，未敢輕進。曹操見兩路軍到，亦分了軍勢，不敢向前攻城。,"In due course Mi Zhu returned saying that Kong Rong had also obtained the services of Liu Bei. The other messenger, Chen Deng, came back and reported that Tian Kai would also bring help. Then was Tao Qian's heart set at ease.But both the leaders, though they had promised aid, greatly dreaded their antagonist and camped among the hills at a great distance, fearful of coming too close to Cao Cao's quarters. Cao Cao knew of their coming and divided his army into parts to meet them, so postponing the attack on the city itself."
卻說劉玄德軍到，見孔融。融曰：「曹兵勢大，操又善於用兵，未可輕戰。且觀其動靜，然後進兵。」玄德曰：「但恐城中無糧，難以久持。備令雲長、子龍領軍四千，在公部下相助；備與張飛奔曹營，逕投徐州去見陶使君商議。」融大喜，會合田楷，為犄角之勢；雲長、子龍領兵兩邊接應。,"Presently Liu Bei came up and went to see Kong Rong, who said, ""The enemy is very powerful, and Cao Cao handles his army skillfully. We must be cautious. Let us make most careful observations before we strike a blow.""""What I fear is famine in the city,"" said Liu Bei. ""They cannot hold out very long. I will put my troops with yours under your command, while I with Zhang Fei make a dash through to see Tao Qian and consult with him.""Kong Rong approved of this, so he and Tian Kai took up positions on the ox-horn formation, with Guan Yu and Zhao Zilong on either side to support them."
是日玄德、張飛引一千人馬殺入曹兵寨邊。正行之間，寨內一聲鼓響，馬軍步軍，如潮似浪，擁將出來。當頭一員大將乃是于禁，勒馬大叫：「何處狂徒！往那裏去！」張飛見了，更不打話，直取于禁。兩馬相交，戰到數合，玄德掣雙股劍麾兵大進，于禁敗走。張飛當前追殺，直到徐州城下。城上望見紅旗白字，大書「平原劉玄德」陶謙急令開門。玄德入城，陶謙接著，共到府衙。禮畢，設宴相待，一面勞軍。,"When Liu Bei and Zhang Fei leading one thousand troops made their dash to get through Cao Cao's army, they got as far as the flank of his camp when there arose a great beating of drums, and horse and foot rolled out like billows on the ocean. The leader was Yu Jin.Yu Jin checked his steed and called out, ""You mad men from somewhere, where are you going?""Zhang Fei heard Yu Jin but deigned no reply. He only rode straight to attack the speaker. After they had fought a few bouts, Liu Bei waved his double swords as signal for his troops to come on, and they drove Yu Jin before them. Zhang Fei led the pursuit and in this way they reached the city wall.From the city wall, the besieged saw a huge banner embroidered in white Liu Bei of Pingyuan, and the Imperial Protector bade them open the gate for the rescuers to enter. Liu Bei was made very welcome, conducted to the residency, and a banquet prepared in his honor. The soldiers also were feasted."
陶謙見玄德儀表軒昂，語言豁達，心中大喜，便命糜竺取徐州牌印，讓與玄德。玄德愕然曰：「公何意也？」謙曰：「今天下擾亂，王綱不振，公乃漢室宗親，正宜力扶社稷。老夫年邁無能，情願將徐州相讓。公勿推辭。謙當自寫表文，申奏朝廷。」玄德離席再拜曰：「劉備雖漢朝苗裔，功微德薄，為平原相猶恐不稱職；今為大義，故來相助；公出此言，莫非疑劉備有吞併之心耶？若舉此念，皇天不佑！」謙曰：「此老夫之實情也。」再三相讓，玄德那裏肯受。糜竺進曰：「今兵臨城下，且當商議退敵之策。待事平之日，再當相讓可也。」玄德曰：「備當遺書於曹操，勸令解和。操若不從，廝殺未遲。」於是傳檄三寨，且按兵不動；遣人齎書以達曹操。,"Tao Qian was delighted with Liu Bei, admiring his high-spirited appearance and clear speech. Tao Qian bade Mi Zhu offer Liu Bei the seal and insignia of the protectorship office. But Liu Bei shrank back startled.""What does this mean?"" said Liu Bei.Tao Qian said, ""There is trouble on every side, and the kingly rule is no longer maintained. You, Sir, are a member of the family and eminently fitted to support them and their prerogatives. I am verging on senility, and I wish to retire in your favor. I pray you not to decline, and I will report my action to the court.""Liu Bei started up from his seat and bowed before his host, saying, ""Scion of the family I may be, but my merit is small and my virtue meager. I doubt my fitness even for my present post, and only a feeling of doing right sent me to your assistance. To hear such speech makes me doubt. Surely you think I came with greed in my heart. May God help me no more if I cherished such a thought!""""It is a poor old man's real sentiment,"" said Tao Qian.Time after time Tao Qian renewed his offer to entrust the region of Xuzhou to Liu Bei, but Liu Bei kept refusing.In the midst of this came Mi Zhu, saying, ""The enemies had reached the wall, and something must be done to drive them off. The present matter could await a more tranquil time.""Said Liu Bei, ""I ought to write to Cao Cao to press him to raise the siege. If he refuses, we will attack forthwith.""Orders were sent to the camps outside to remain quiescent till the letter could reach Cao Cao."
卻說曹操正在軍中，與諸將議事，人報徐州有戰書到。操拆而觀之，乃劉備書也。書略曰：「備自關外得拜君顏，嗣後天各一方，不及趨侍。向者，尊父曹侯，實因張闓不仁，以致被害，非陶恭祖之罪也。目今黃巾遺孽，擾亂於外；董卓餘黨，盤踞於內。願明公先朝廷之急，而後私讎；撤徐州之兵，以救國難：則徐州幸甚，天下幸甚！」,"It happened that Cao Cao was holding a council when a messenger with a war letter was announced. The letter was brought in and handed to him and, when he had opened and looked at it, he found it was from Liu Bei.This is the letter, very nearly:""Since meeting you outside the pass, fate has assigned us to different quarters of the world, and I have not been able to pay my respects to you. Touching the death of your noble father, it was owing to the vicious nature of Zhang Kai and due to no fault of Tao Qian. Now while the remnant of the Yellow Scarves is disturbing the lands, and Dong Zhuo's partisans have the upper hand in the capital, I wish that you, Illustrious Sir, would regard the critical position of the court rather than your personal grievances, and so divert your forces from the attack on Xuzhou to the rescue of the state. Such would be for the happiness of this city and the whole empire."""
曹操看書，大罵：「劉備何人，敢以書來勸我！且中間有譏諷之意！」命斬來使，一面竭力攻城。郭嘉諫曰：「劉備遠來救援，先禮後兵，主公當用好言答之，以慢備心；然後進兵攻城，城可破也。」操從其言，款留來使，候發回書。,"Cao Cao gave vent to a torrent of abuse: ""Who is this Liu Bei that he dares write and exhort me? Beside, he means to be satirical.""Cao Cao issued orders to put the bearer of the letter to death and to press on the siege.But Guo Jia remonstrated, saying, ""Liu Bei has come from afar to help Tao Qian, and he is trying the effect of politeness before resorting to arms. I pray you, my lord, reply with fair words that his heart may be lulled with a feeling of safety. Then attack with vigor and the city will fall.""Cao Cao found this advice good, so he spared the messenger, telling him to wait to carry back his reply."
正商議間，忽流星馬飛報「禍事！」。操問其故，報說呂布已襲破兗州，進據濮陽。原來呂布自遭李、郭之亂，逃出武關，去投袁術；術怪呂布反覆不定，拒而不納。投袁紹，紹納之，與布共破張燕於常山；布自以為得志，傲慢袁紹手下將士。紹欲殺之，布乃去投張揚，揚納之。時龐舒在長安城中，私藏呂布妻小，送還呂布。李傕、郭汜知之，遂斬龐舒，寫書與張揚，教殺呂布；布因棄張揚去投張邈。恰好張邈弟張超引陳宮來見張邈。宮說邈曰：「今天下分崩，英雄並起，君以千里之眾，而反受制於人，不亦鄙乎！今曹操征東，兗州空虛，而呂布乃當世勇士，若與之共取兗州，伯業可圖也。」張邈大喜，便令呂布襲破兗州，隨據濮陽。止有鄄城，東阿，范縣三處，被荀彧、程昱設計死守得全，其餘俱破。曹仁屢戰，皆不能勝，特此告急。,"While this was going on, a horseman came with news of misfortune: ""Lu Bu has invaded Yanzhou, now holding Puyang. The three counties left —-Juancheng, Fanxia, and Dongjun —-are under severe attacks!""When Li Jue and Guo Si, the two partisans of Dong Zhuo, succeeded in their attack on the capital, Lu Bu had fled to Yuan Shu. However, Yuan Shu looked askance at him for his instability and refused to receive him. Then Lu Bu went to try Yuan Shao, who was a brother of Yuan Shu. Yuan Shao accepted the warrior and made use of him in an attack upon Zhang Yan in Changshan. But Lu Bu's success filled him with pride, and his arrogant demeanor so annoyed the other commanders that Yuan Shao was on the point of putting him to death. To escape this Lu Bu had gone away to Zhang Yang, Governor of Shangdang, who accepted his services.About this time Pang Shu, who had been hiding and protecting Lu Bu's family in Changan since his disappearance, restored them to him. This deed angered Li Jue and Guo Si so that they put Pang Shu to death and wrote to Lu Bu's protector to serve him the same. To escape this Lu Bu once again had to flee and this time joined himself to Zhang Miao, the Governor of Chenliu.Lu Bu arrived just as Zhang Miao's brother, Zhang Chao, was introducing Chen Gong.Chen Gong said to Zhang Miao, ""The rupture of the empire has begun, and warlords are seizing what they can. It is strange that you, with all the advantages of population and provisions you enjoy, do not strike for independence. Cao Cao has gone on an expedition against the east, leaving his own territory defenseless. Lu Bu is one of the warriors of the day. If you and he together attacked and got Yanzhou, you could then proceed to the dominion.""Zhang Miao was pleased and resolved to try. He ordered an attack, and soon Lu Bu was in possession of Yanzhou and its neighborhood, all but three small counties of Juancheng, Fanxia, and Dongjun, which were vigorously and desperately defended by Xun Yu and Cheng Yu in concert. Cao Cao's cousin, Cao Ren, had fought many battles but was repeatedly defeated, and the messenger with the evil tidings had come from him asking prompt help."
操聞報大驚曰：「兗州有失，使吾無家可歸矣，不可不亟圖之！」郭嘉曰：「主公正好賣個人情與劉備，退軍去復兗州。」操然之，即時答書與劉備，拔寨退兵。,"Cao Cao was greatly disturbed by this and said, ""If my own region be lost, I have no home to return to! I must do something at once.""""The best thing would be to become friends with Liu Bei at any cost and return to Yanzhou,"" said Guo Jia.Then Cao Cao wrote to Liu Bei, gave the letter to the waiting messenger and broke camp."
且說來使回徐州，入城見陶謙，呈上書札，言曹兵已退。謙大喜，差人請孔融，田楷，雲長，子龍等赴城大會。飲宴既畢，謙延玄德於上座，拱手對眾曰：「老夫年邁，二子不才，不堪國家重任。劉公乃帝室之胄，德廣才高，可領徐州。老夫情願乞閒養病。」玄德曰：「孔文舉令備來救徐州，為義也；今無端據而有之，天下將以備為無義人矣。」糜竺曰：「今漢室陵遲，海宇顛覆，樹功立業，正在此時。徐州殷富，戶口百萬，劉使君領此，不可辭也。」玄德曰：「此事決不敢應命。」陳登曰：「陶府君多病，不能視事，明公勿辭。」玄德曰：「袁公路四世三公，海內所歸，近在壽春，何不以州讓之？」孔融曰：「袁公路塚中枯骨，何足挂齒！今日之事，天與不取，悔不可追。」,"The news that the enemy had left was very gratifying to Tao Qian, who then invited his various defenders into Xuzhou City and prepared banquets and feasts in token of his gratitude.At one of these, when the feasting was over, he proceeded with his wish of retirement in favor of Liu Bei. Placing Liu Bei in the seat of highest honor, Tao Qian bowed before him and then addressed the assembly, ""I am old and feeble, and my two sons lack the ability to hold so important an office as this. The noble Liu Bei is a descendant of the imperial house. He is of lofty virtue and great talent. Let him then take over the rule of this region, and only too willingly I shall retire to have leisure to nurse my health.""Liu Bei replied, ""I came at the request of Governor Kong Rong, because it was the right thing to do. Xuzhou is saved; but if I take it, surely the world will say I am a wicked man.""Mi Zhu said, ""You may not refuse. The House of Han is falling, their realm is crumbling, and now is the time for doughty deeds and signal services. This is a fertile region, well populated and rich, and you are the man to rule over it.""""But I cannot accept,"" said Liu Bei.""Imperial Protector Tao Qian is a great sufferer,"" said Chen Deng, ""and cannot see to matters. You may not decline, Sir.""Said Liu Bei, ""Yuan Shu belongs to a family of rulers, who have held the highest offices of state four times in three generations. The multitude people respects him. Why not invite him to this task?""""Because Yuan Shu is a drying skeleton in a dark tomb: Not worth talking about. This opportunity is a gift from Heaven, and you will never cease to regret its loss,"" said Kong Rong."
玄德堅執不肯。陶謙泣下曰：「君若捨我而去，我死不瞑目矣！」雲長曰：「既承陶公相讓，兄且權領州事。」張飛曰：「又不是我強要他的州郡；他好意相讓，何必苦苦推辭？」玄德曰：「汝等欲陷我於不義耶？」陶謙推讓再三，玄德只是不受。陶謙曰：「如玄德必不肯從，此間近邑，名小沛，足可屯軍。請玄德暫駐軍此邑，以保徐州，何如？」眾皆勸玄德留小沛，玄德從之。陶謙勞軍已畢，趙雲辭去，玄德執手揮淚而別。孔融、田楷亦各相別，引軍自回。玄德與關、張引本部軍來至小沛，修葺城垣，撫諭居民。,"But still Liu Bei obstinately refused. Tao Qian besought him with tears, saying, ""I shall die if you leave me, and there will be none to close my eyes.""""Brother, you should accept the offer thus made,"" said Guan Yu.""Why so much fuss?"" said Zhang Fei. ""We have not taken the place. It is he who wishes to give it to you.""""You all persuade me to do what is wrong,"" said Liu Bei.Seeing he could not persuade Liu Bei, Tao Qian then said, ""As you are set in determination, perhaps you will consent to encamp at Xiaopei. It is only a little town, but thence you can keep watch and ward over the region.""They all with one voice prayed Liu Bei to consent, so he gave in. The feast of victory being now ended, the time came to say farewell. When Zhao Zilong took his leave, Liu Bei held his hands alternately while dashing away the falling tears. Kong Rong and Tian Kai went home to their own places.When Liu Bei and his brothers took up their abode in Xiaopei, they first repaired the defenses, and then they put out proclamations in order to calm the inhabitants."
卻說曹操回軍，曹仁接著，言呂布勢大，更有陳宮為輔，兗州、濮陽已失，其鄄城，東阿，范縣三處，賴荀彧、程昱二人設計相連，死守城郭。操曰：「吾料呂布有勇無謀，不足慮也。」教且安營下寨，再作商議。呂布知曹操回兵，已過滕縣，召副將薛蘭、李封曰：「吾欲用汝二人久矣。汝可引軍一萬，堅守兗州。吾親自率兵，前去破曹。」,"In the meantime Cao Cao had marched toward his own region (AD 194).Cao Ren met and told him, ""Lu Bu is very powerful, and he has Chen Gong as Adviser. Yanzhou is as good as lost, with the exception of three counties which Xun Yu and Cheng Yu are vigorously defending together.""Cao Cao said, ""I own that Lu Bu is a bold fighter but nothing more: He has no craft. So we need not fear him seriously.""Then he gave orders to make a strong camp till they could think out some victorious plan.Lu Bu, knowing of Cao Cao's return, called two of his subordinate generals, Xue Lan and Li Fang, to him and assigned to them the task of holding the city of Yanzhou, saying, ""I have long waited for opportunity to employ your skill. Now I give you ten thousand soldiers, and you are to hold the city while I go forth to attack Cao Cao."""
二人應諾。陳宮急入見曰：「將軍棄兗州，欲何往乎？」布曰：「吾欲屯兵濮陽，以成鼎足之勢。」宮曰：「差矣。薛蘭必守兗州不住。此去正南一百八十里，泰山路險，可伏精兵萬人在彼。曹兵聞失兗州，必然倍道而進，待其過半，一擊可擒也。」布曰：「吾屯濮陽，別有良謀，汝豈知之！」遂不用陳宮之言，而用薛蘭守兗州而行。,"The two accepted. But Chen Gong, the strategist, came in hastily, saying, ""General, you are going away. Whither?""""I am going to camp my troops at Puyang, to establish an ox-horn vantage.""""You are making a mistake,"" said Chen Gong. ""The two you have chosen to defend this city are unequal to the task. For this expedition remember that about sixty miles due south, on the treacherous road to the Taishan Mountains, is a very advantageous position where you should place your best men in ambush. Cao Cao will hasten homeward by double marches when he hears what has happened. If you strike when half his troops have gone past this point, you may seize him.""Said Lu Bu, ""I am going to occupy Puyang and see what develops. How can you guess my big plan?""So Lu Bu left Xue Lan in command at Yanzhou and went away."
曹操兵行至泰山險路，郭嘉曰：「且不可進：恐此處有伏兵。」曹操笑曰：「呂布無謀之輩，故教薛蘭守兗州，自往濮陽；安得此處有埋伏耶？」教曹仁領一軍圍兗州，吾進兵濮陽，速攻呂布。,"Now when Cao Cao approached the dangerous part of the road near the Taishan Mountains, Guo Jia warned him, saying, ""Do not advance hastily, my lord. There is doubtless an ambush.""But Cao Cao laughed, saying, ""We know all Lu Bu's dispositions. Xue Lan is keeping the city, while Lu Bu is massing his troops at Puyang. Do you think Lu Bu has laid an ambush? I shall tell Cao Ren to besiege Yanzhou, and I shall go to Puyang."""
陳宮聞曹兵至近，乃獻計曰：「今曹兵遠來疲困，利在速戰，不可養成氣力。」布曰：「吾匹馬縱橫天下，何愁曹操！待其下寨，吾自擒之。」,"In Puyang, when Chen Gong heard of the enemy's approach, he spoke, saying, ""The enemy will be fatigued with long marches, so attack quickly before they have time to recover.""Lu Bu replied, ""I, a single horseman, am afraid of none. I come and go as I will. Think you I fear this Cao Cao? Let him settle his camp; I will take him after that."""
卻說曹操兵近濮陽，下住寨腳。次日引眾將出，陳兵於野。操立馬於門旗下，遙望呂布兵到。陣圓處，呂布當先出馬，兩邊排開八員健將：第一個雁門馬邑人：張，名遼，字文遠；第二個泰山華陰人：姓臧，名霸，字宣高；兩將又各引六員健將：郝萌，曹性，成廉，魏續，宋憲，侯成。布軍五萬，鼓聲大震。,"Now Cao Cao neared Puyang, and he made a camp. The next day he led out his commanders, and they arrayed their armies in open country. Cao Cao took up his station on horseback between the two standards, watching while his opponents arrived and formed up in a circular area.Lu Bu was in front, followed by eight of his generals, all strong men: Zhang Liao of Mayi, backed by Hao Meng, Cao Xing, and Cheng Lian; Zang Ba of Huaying, backed by Wei Xu, Song Xian, and Hou Cheng. They led an army of fifty thousand in total. The drums began their thunderous roll."
操指呂布而言曰：「吾與汝自來無讎，何得奪吾州郡？」布曰：「漢家城池，諸人有分，偏爾合得？」便叫臧霸出馬搦戰。曹軍內樂進出迎。兩馬相交，雙鎗齊舉。戰到三十餘合，勝負不分。夏侯惇拍馬便出助戰，呂布陣上，張遼截住廝殺。惱得呂布性起，挺戟驟馬，衝出陣來，夏侯惇、樂進皆走。呂布掩殺，曹軍大敗，退三四十里。布自收軍。,"Cao Cao, pointing to his opponent, said, ""You and I had no quarrel, why then did you invade my land?""""The cities of Han are the possession of all. What is your special claim?"" said Lu Bu.So saying, Lu Bu ordered Zang Ba to ride forth and challenge. From Cao Cao's side the challenge was accepted by Yue Jing. The two steeds approached each other; two spears were lifted both together, and they exchanged near thirty blows with no advantage to either. Then Xiahou Dun rode out to help his colleague and, in reply, out went Zhang Liao from Lu Bu's side. And they four fought.Then fierce anger seized upon Lu Bu. Setting his trident halberd, he urged his Red Hare forward to where the fight was waging. Seeing him approach, Xiahou Dun and Yue Jing both fled, but Lu Bu pressed on after them, and Cao Cao's army lost the day. Retiring ten miles, they made a new camp. Lu Bu called in and mustered his troops."
曹操輸了一陣，回寨與諸將商議。于禁曰：「某今日上山觀望，濮陽之西，呂布有一寨，約無多軍。今夜彼將謂我軍敗走，必不準備，可引兵擊之；若得寨，布軍必懼：此為上策。」操從其言，帶曹洪，李典，毛玠，呂虔，于禁，典韋六將，選馬步二萬人，連夜從小路進發。,"The day having gone against him, Cao Cao called a council, and Yu Jin said, ""From the hill tops today I saw a camp of our enemies on the west of Puyang. They were but few men therein, and tonight after today's victory, it will not be defended. Let us attack; and if we can take the camp, we shall strike fear into the heart of Lu Bu. This is our best plan.""Cao Cao thought so too. He and six of his generals —-Cao Hong, Li Dian, Mao Jie, Lu Qian, Yu Jin, and Dian Wei —-and twenty thousand horse and foot left that night by a secret road for the camp."
卻說呂布於寨中勞軍。陳宮曰：「西寨是個要緊去處，倘或曹操襲之，奈何？」布曰：「他今日輸了一陣，如何敢來？」宮曰：「曹操是極能用兵之人，須防他攻我不備。」布乃撥高順并魏續、侯成引兵往守西寨。卻說曹操於黃昏時分，引軍至西寨，四面突入。寨兵不能抵擋，四散奔走，曹操奪了寨。將及四更，高順方引軍到，殺將入來。曹操自引軍馬來迎，正逢高順，三軍混戰。將及天明，正西鼓聲大震，人報呂布自引軍來了。操棄寨而走。背後高順，魏續，侯成趕來，當頭呂布親自引軍來到。于禁，樂進，雙戰呂布不住，操望北而行。山後一彪軍出：左有張遼，右有臧霸。操使呂虔、曹洪戰之，不利，操望西而走。忽又喊聲大震，一彪軍至：郝萌，曹性，成廉，宋憲四將攔住去路。眾將死戰，操當先衝陣。梆子響處，箭如驟雨射將來。操不能前進，無計可脫，大叫：「誰人救我！」,"In his camp Lu Bu was rejoicing for that day's victory, when Chen Gong reminded him, saying, ""The western camp is importance point, and it might be attacked.""But Lu Bu replied, ""The enemy will not dare approach after today's defeat.""""Cao Cao is a very able commander,"" replied Chen Gong. ""You must keep a good lookout for him lest he attack our weak spot.""So arrangements were made for defense. Generals Gao Shun, Wei Xu, and Hou Cheng were ordered to march there.At dusk Cao Cao reached the camp and began an immediate attack on all four sides. The defenders could not hold him off. They ran in all directions, and the camp was captured. Near the fourth watch, when the defending party came, Cao Cao sallied forth to meet them and met Gao Shun. Another battle then began and waged till dawn. About that time a rolling of drums was heard in the west, and they told Cao Cao that Lu Bu himself was at hand. Thereupon Cao Cao abandoned the attack and fled.Gao Shun, Wei Xu, and Hou Cheng pursued him, while Lu Bu blocked his escape route. Cao Cao's two generals, Yu Jin and Yue Jing, attacked Lu Bu's troops but could not break them. Cao Cao went away north. But from behind some hills came out Zhang Liao and Zang Ba to attack. Lu Qian and Cao Hong were sent to stop the attackers, but Lu Qian and Cao Hong were both defeated. Cao Cao sought safety in the west. Here again his retreat was met by Lu Bu's four generals, Hao Meng, Cao Xing, Cheng Lian, and Song Xian.The fight became desperate. Cao Cao dashed at the enemy's array. The din was terrible. Arrows fell like pelting rain upon them, and they could make no headway.Cao Cao was desperate and cried out in fear, ""Who can save me?"""
馬軍隊裏，一將踴出：乃典韋也。手挺雙鐵戟，大叫：「主公勿憂！」飛身下馬，插住雙戟，取短戟十數枝，挾在手中，顧從人曰：「賊來十步乃呼我！」遂放開腳步，冒箭前行。布軍數十騎追至，從人大叫：「十步矣！」韋曰：「五步乃呼我！」從人又曰：「五步矣！」韋乃飛戟刺之，一戟一人墜馬，並無虛發，立殺十數人。眾皆奔走。韋復飛身上馬，挺一雙大鐵戟，衝殺入去。郝、曹、成、宋四將不能抵擋，各自逃去。典韋殺散敵軍，救出曹操，眾將隨後也到，尋路歸寨。,"Then from the crush dashed out Dian Wei with his double spears, crying, ""Fear not, my lord!""Dian Wei leapt from his steed, put aside his double spears, and laid hold of a handful of battle-axes. Turning to his followers he said, ""When the ruffians are at ten paces, call out to me.""Then he set off with mighty strides, plunging forward, careless of the flying arrows. Lu Bu's horsemen followed, and when they got near, Dian Wei's followers shouted, ""Ten paces!""""Five, then call!"" shouted back Dian Wei, and went on.Presently, ""Five paces!""Then Dian Wei spun round and flung the battle-axes. With every fling a man fell from the saddle and never a battle-ax missed.Having thus slain ten or so the remainder fled, and Dian Wei quickly remounted his steed, set his twin spears and rushed again into the fight with a vigor that none could withstand. One by one his opponents yielded, and he was able to lead Cao Cao safely out of the press of battle. Cao Cao and his commanders went to their camp."
看看天色傍晚，背後喊聲起處，呂布驟馬提戟趕來，大叫：「操賊休走！」此時人困馬乏，大家面面相覷，各欲逃生。正是：,"But as evening fell, the noise of pursuit fell on their ears, and soon appeared Lu Bu himself.""Cao Cao, you rebel, do not flee!"" shouted Lu Bu as he approached with his halberd ready for a thrust.All stopped and looked in each others' faces: The soldiers were weary, their steeds spent. Fear smote them, and they looked around for some place of refuge."
雖能暫把重圍脫，只怕難當勁敵追。不知曹操性命如何，且聽下文分解。,"You may lead your lord safely out of the press,But what if the enemy follow?We cannot say here what Cao Cao's fate was, but the next chapter will relate."
