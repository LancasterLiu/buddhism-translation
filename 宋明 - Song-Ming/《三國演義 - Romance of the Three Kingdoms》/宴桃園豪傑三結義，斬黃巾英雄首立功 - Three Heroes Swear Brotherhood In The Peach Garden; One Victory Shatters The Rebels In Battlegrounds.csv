詞曰：,So sung:
滾滾長江東逝水，浪花淘盡英雄。是非成敗轉頭空：青山依舊在，幾度夕陽紅。白髮漁樵江渚上，慣看秋月春風。一壺濁酒喜相逢：古今多少事，都付笑談中。,"O so vast, O so mighty, The Great River rolls to sea,Flowers do waves thrash, Heroes do sands smash,When all the dreams drain, Same are loss and gain.Green mountains remain, Under pink sunsets,Hoary fishers and woodcutters, Along the banks, find calm water,In autumn moon or in spring wind, By the wine jars, fill porcelain.Discuss talk and tale, Only laugh and gale..."
話說天下大勢，分久必合，合久必分：周末七國分爭，并入於秦。及秦滅之後，楚、漢分爭，又并入於漢。漢朝自高祖斬白蛇而起義，一統天下。後來光武中興，傳至獻帝，遂分為三國。推其致亂之由，殆始於桓、靈二帝。桓帝禁錮善類，崇信宦官。及桓帝崩，靈帝即位，大將軍竇武、太傅陳蕃，共相輔佐。時有宦官曹節等弄權，竇武、陳蕃謀誅之，作事不密，反為所害。中涓自此愈橫。,"The world under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity. When the rule of the Zhou Dynasty weakened, seven contending kingdoms sprang up, warring one with another until the kingdom of Qin prevailed and possessed the empire. But when Qin's destiny had been fulfilled, arose two opposing kingdoms, Chu and Han, to fight for the mastery. And Han was the victor.The rise of the fortunes of Han began when Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor slew a white serpent to raise the banners of uprising, which only ended when the whole empire belonged to Han (BC 202). This magnificent heritage was handed down in successive Han emperors for two hundred years, till the rebellion of Wang Mang caused a disruption. But soon Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder restored the empire, and Han emperors continued their rule for another two hundred years till the days of Emperor Xian, which were doomed to see the beginning of the empire's division into three parts, known to history as The Three Kingdoms.But the descent into misrule hastened in the reigns of the two predecessors of Emperor Xian—-Emperors Huan and Ling—-who sat in the dragon throne about the middle of the second century.Emperor Huan paid no heed to the good people of his court, but gave his confidence to the Palace eunuchs. He lived and died, leaving the scepter to Emperor Ling, whose advisers were Regent Marshal Dou Wu and Imperial Guardian Chen Fan. Dou Wu and Chen Fan, disgusted with the abuses of the eunuchs in the affairs of the state, plotted the destruction for the power-abusing eunuchs. But Chief Eunuch Cao Jie was not to be disposed of easily. The plot leaked out, and the honest Dou Wu and Chen Fan were put to death, leaving the eunuchs stronger than before."
建寧二年四月望日，帝御溫德殿。方陞座，殿角狂風驟起，只見一條大青蛇，從梁上飛將下來，蟠於椅上。帝驚倒，左右急救入宮，百官俱奔避。須臾，蛇不見了。忽然大雷大雨，加以冰雹，落到半夜方止，壞卻房屋無數。建寧四年二月，洛陽地震；又海水泛溢，沿海居民，盡被大浪捲入海中。光和元年，雌雞化雄。六月朔，黑氣十餘丈，飛入溫德殿中。秋七月，有虹見於玉堂；五原山岸，盡皆崩裂。種種不祥，非止一端。,"It fell upon the day of full moon of the fourth month, the second year, in the era of Established Calm (AD 168), that Emperor Ling went in state to the Hall of Virtue. As he drew near the throne, a rushing whirlwind arose in the corner of the hall and, lo! from the roof beams floated down a monstrous black serpent that coiled itself up on the very seat of majesty. The Emperor fell in a swoon. Those nearest him hastily raised and bore him to his palace, while the courtiers scattered and fled. The serpent disappeared.But there followed a terrific tempest, thunder, hail, and torrents of rain, lasting till midnight and working havoc on all sides. Two years later the earth quaked in Capital Luoyang, while along the coast a huge tidal wave rushed in which, in its recoil, swept away all the dwellers by the sea. Another evil omen was recorded ten years later, when the reign title was changed to Radiant Harmony (AD 178): Certain hens suddenly crowed. At the new moon of the sixth month, a long wreath of murky cloud wound its way into the Hall of Virtue, while in the following month a rainbow was seen in the Dragon Chamber. Away from the capital, a part of the Yuan Mountains collapsed, leaving a mighty rift in the flank. Such were some of various omens."
帝下詔問群臣以災異之由，議郎蔡邕上疏，以為蜺墮雞化，乃婦寺干政之所致，言頗切直。帝覽奏歎息，因起更衣。曹節在後竊視，悉宣告左右·遂以他事陷邕於罪，放歸田里。後張讓，趙忠，封諝，段珪，曹節，候覽，蹇碩，程曠，夏惲，郭勝十人朋比為奸，號為「十常侍」。帝尊信張讓，呼為「阿父」，朝政日非，以致天下人心思亂，盜賊蜂起。,"Emperor Ling, greatly moved by these signs of the displeasure of Heaven, issued an edict asking his ministers for an explanation of the calamities and marvels.Court Counselor Cai Yong replied bluntly: ""Falling rainbows and changes of fowls' sexes are brought about by the interference of empresses and eunuchs in state affairs.""The Emperor read this memorial with deep sighs, and Chief Eunuch Cao Jie, from his place behind the throne, anxiously noted these signs of grief. An opportunity offering, Cao Jie informed his fellows, and a charge was trumped up against Cai Yong, who was driven from the court and forced to retire to his country house.With this victory the eunuchs grew bolder. Ten of them, rivals in wickedness and associates in evil deeds, formed a powerful party known as the Ten Regular Attendants—-Zhang Rang, Zhao Zhong, Cheng Kuang, Duan Gui, Feng Xu, Guo Sheng, Hou Lan, Jian Shuo, Cao Jie, and Xia Yun.One of them, Zhang Rang, won such influence that he became the Emperor's most honored and trusted adviser. The Emperor even called him ""Foster Father"". So the corrupt state administration went quickly from bad to worse, till the country was ripe for rebellion and buzzed with brigandage."
時鉅鹿郡有兄弟三人：一名張角，一名張寶，一名張梁。那張角本是個不第秀才。因入山採藥，遇一老人，碧眼童顏，手執藜杖，喚角至一洞中，以天書三卷授之，曰：「此名太平要術。汝得之，當代天宣化，普救世人；若萌異心，必獲惡報。」角拜問姓名。老人曰：「吾乃南華老仙也。」言訖，化陣清風而去。,"At this time in the county of Julu was a certain Zhang family, of whom three brothers bore the name of Zhang Jue, Zhang Bao, and Zhang Liang, respectively. The eldest Zhang Jue was an unclassed graduate, who devoted himself to medicine. One day, while culling simples in the woods, Zhang Jue met a venerable old gentleman with very bright, emerald eyes and fresh complexion, who walked with an oak-wood staff. The old man beckoned Zhang Jue into a cave and there gave him three volumes of The Book of Heaven.""This book,"" said the old gentleman, ""is the Essential Arts of Peace. With the aid of these volumes, you can convert the world and rescue humankind. But you must be single-minded, or, rest assured, you will greatly suffer.""With a humble obeisance, Zhang Jue took the book and asked the name of his benefactor.""I am Saint Hermit of the Southern Land,"" was the reply, as the old gentleman disappeared in thin air."
角得此書，曉夜攻習，能呼風喚雨，號為太平道人。中平元年正月內，疫氣流行，張角散施符水，為人治病，自稱大賢良師。角有徒弟五百餘人，雲游四方，皆能書符念咒。次後徒眾日多，角乃立三十六方，─大方萬餘人，小方六七千─，各立渠帥，稱為將軍。訛言「蒼天已死，黃天當立。」又云「歲在甲子，天下大吉。」令人各以白土，書「甲子」二字於家中大門上。青、幽、徐、冀、荊、揚、兗、豫八州之人，家家侍奉大賢良師張角名字。角遣其黨馬元義，暗齎金帛，結交中涓封諝，以為內應。角與二弟商議曰：「至難得者，民心也。今民心已順，若不乘勢取天下，誠為可惜。」遂一面私造黃旗，約期舉事；一面使弟子唐州，馳書報封諝。唐州乃逕赴省中告變。帝召大將軍何進調兵擒馬元義，斬之；次收封諝等一干人下獄。,"Zhang Jue studied the wonderful book eagerly and strove day and night to reduce its precepts to practice. Before long, he could summon the winds and command the rain, and he became known as the Mystic of the Way of Peace.In the first month of the first year of Central Stability (AD 184), there was a terrible pestilence that ran throughout the land, whereupon Zhang Jue distributed charmed remedies to the afflicted. The godly medicines brought big successes, and soon he gained the tittle of the Wise and Worthy Master. He began to have a following of disciples whom he initiated into the mysteries and sent abroad throughout all the land. They, like their master, could write charms and recite formulas, and their fame increased his following.Zhang Jue began to organize his disciples. He established thirty-six circuits, the larger with ten thousand or more members, the smaller with about half that number. Each circuit had its chief who took the military title of General. They talked wildly of the death of the blue heaven and the setting up of the golden one; they said a new cycle was beginning and would bring universal good fortune to all members; and they persuaded people to chalk the symbols for the first year of the new cycle on the main door of their dwellings.With the growth of the number of his supporters grew also the ambition of Zhang Jue. The Wise and Worthy Master dreamed of empire. One of his partisans, Ma Yuanyi, was sent bearing gifts to gain the support of the eunuchs within the Palace.To his brothers Zhang Jue said, ""For schemes like ours always the most difficult part is to gain the popular favor. But that is already ours. Such an opportunity must not pass.""And they began to prepare. Many yellow flags and banners were made, and a day was chosen for the uprising. Then Zhang Jue wrote letters to Feng Xu and sent them by one of his followers, Tang Zhou, who alas! betrayed his trust and reported the plot to the court. The Emperor summoned the trusty Regent Marshal He Jin and bade him look to the issue. Ma Yuanyi was at once taken and beheaded. Feng Xu and many others were cast into prison."
張角聞知事露，星夜舉兵，自稱天公將軍，─張寶稱地公將軍，張梁稱人公將軍─。申言於眾曰：「今漢運將終，大聖人出；汝等皆宜順從天意，以槳太平。」四方百姓，裹黃巾從張角反者，四五十萬。賊勢浩大，官軍望風而靡。何進奏帝火速降詔，令各處備禦，討賊立功；一面遣中郎將盧植，皇甫嵩，朱雋，各引精兵，分三路討之。,"The plot having thus become known, the Zhang brothers were forced at once to take the field. They took up grandiose titles: Zhang Jue the Lord of Heaven, Zhang Bao the Lord of Earth, and Zhang Liang the Lord of Human. And in these names they put forth this manifesto:""The good fortune of the Han is exhausted, and the Wise and Worthy Man has appeared. Discern the will of Heaven, O ye people, and walk in the way of righteousness, whereby alone ye may attain to peace.""Support was not lacking. On every side people bound their heads with yellow scarves and joined the army of the rebel Zhang Jue, so that soon his strength was nearly half a million strong, and the official troops melted away at a whisper of his coming.Regent Marshal and Imperial Guardian, He Jin, memorialized for general preparations against the Yellow Scarves, and an edict called upon everyone to fight against the rebels. In the meantime, three Imperial Commanders—-Lu Zhi, Huangfu Song, and Zhu Jun—-marched against them in three directions with veteran soldiers."
且說張角一軍，前犯幽州界分。幽州太守劉焉，乃江夏竟陵人氏，漢魯恭王之後也；當時聞得賊兵將至，召校尉鄒靖計議。靖曰：「賊兵眾，我兵寡，明公宜作速招軍應敵。」劉焉然其說，隨即出榜招募義兵。榜文行到涿縣，乃引出涿縣中一個英雄。,"Meanwhile Zhang Jue led his army into Youzhou, the northeastern region of the empire. The Imperial Protector of Youzhou was Liu Yan, a scion of the Imperial House. Learning of the approach of the rebels, Liu Yan called in Commander Zhou Jing to consult over the position.Zhou Jing said, ""They are many and we few. We must enlist more troops to oppose them.""Liu Yan agreed, and he put out notices calling for volunteers to serve against the rebels. One of these notices was posted up in the county of Zhuo, where lived one man of high spirit."
那人不甚好讀書；性寬和，寡言語，喜怒不形於色；素有大志，專好結交天下豪傑；生得身長七尺五寸，兩耳垂肩，雙手過膝，目能自顧其耳，面如冠玉，脣若塗脂；中山靖王劉勝之後，漢景帝閣下玄孫；姓劉，名備，字玄德。昔劉勝之子劉貞，漢武時封涿鹿亭侯，後坐酬金失侯，因此遺這一枝在涿縣。玄德祖劉雄，父劉弘。弘曾舉孝廉，亦嘗作吏，早喪。玄德幼孤，事母至孝；家貧，販屨織蓆為業。家住本縣樓桑村。其家之東南，有一大桑樹，高五丈餘，遙望之，童童如車蓋。相者云：「此家必出貴人。」,"This man was no mere bookish scholar, nor found he any pleasure in study. But he was liberal and amiable, albeit a man of few words, hiding all feeling under a calm exterior. He had always cherished a yearning for high enterprise and had cultivated the friendship of humans of mark. He was tall of stature. His ears were long, the lobes touching his shoulders, and his hands hung down below his knees. His eyes were very big and prominent so that he could see backward past his ears. His complexion was as clear as jade, and he had rich red lips.He was a descendant of Prince Sheng of Zhongshan whose father was the Emperor Jing (reigned BC 157-141), the fourth emperor of the Han Dynasty. His name was Liu Bei. Many years before, one of his forbears had been the governor of that very county, but had lost his rank for remissness in ceremonial offerings. However, that branch of the family had remained on in the place, gradually becoming poorer and poorer as the years rolled on. His father Liu Hong had been a scholar and a virtuous official but died young. The widow and orphan were left alone, and Liu Bei as a lad won a reputation for filial piety.At this time the family had sunk deep in poverty, and Liu Bei gained his living by selling straw sandals and weaving grass mats. The family home was in a village near the chief city of Zhuo. Near the house stood a huge mulberry tree, and seen from afar its curved profile resembled the canopy of a wagon. Noting the luxuriance of its foliage, a soothsayer had predicted that one day a man of distinction would come forth from the family."
玄德幼時，與鄉中小兒戲於樹下，曰：「我為天子，當乘此車蓋。」叔父劉元起奇其言，曰：「此兒非常人也！」因見玄德家貧，常資給之。年十五歲，母使游學，嘗師事鄭玄、盧植；與公孫瓚等為友。及劉焉發榜招軍時，玄德年己二十八歲矣。當日見了榜文，慨然長歎。隨後一人厲聲言曰：「大丈夫不與國家出力，何故長歎？」,"As a child, Liu Bei played with the other village children beneath this tree, and he would climb up into it, saying, ""I am the Son of Heaven, and this is my chariot!"" His uncle, Liu Yuanqi, recognized that Liu Bei was no ordinary boy and saw to it that the family did not come to actual want.When Liu Bei was fifteen, his mother sent him traveling for his education. For a time he served Zheng Xuan and Lu Zhi as masters. And he became great friends with Gongsun Zan.Liu Bei was twenty-eight when the outbreak of the Yellow Scarves called for soldiers. The sight of the notice saddened him, and he sighed as he read it.Suddenly a rasping voice behind him cried, ""Sir, why sigh if you do nothing to help your country?"""
玄德回視其人：身長八尺，豹頭環眼，燕頷虎鬚，聲若巨雷，勢如奔馬。玄德見他形貌異常，問其姓名。其人曰：「某姓張，名飛，字翼德。世居涿郡，頗有莊田，賣酒屠豬，專好結交天下豪傑。適纔見公看榜而歎，故此相問。」玄德曰：「我本漢室宗親，姓劉，名備。今聞黃巾倡亂，有志欲破賊安民；恨力不能，故長歎耳。」飛曰：「吾頗有資財，當招募鄉勇，與公同舉大事，如何？」玄德甚喜，遂與同入村店中飲酒。,"Turning quickly he saw standing there a man about his own height, with a bullet head like a leopard's, large eyes, a swallow pointed chin, and whiskers like a tiger's . He spoke in a loud bass voice and looked as irresistible as a dashing horse. At once Liu Bei saw he was no ordinary man and asked who he was.""Zhang Fei is my name,"" replied the stranger. ""I live near here where I have a farm; and I am a wine seller and a butcher as well; and I like to become acquainted with worthy people. Your sighs as you read the notice drew me toward you.""Liu Bei replied, ""I am of the Imperial Family, Liu Bei is my name. And I wish I could destroy these Yellow Scarves and restore peace to the land, but alas! I am helpless.""""I have the means,"" said Zhang Fei. ""Suppose you and I raised some troops and tried what we could do.""This was happy news for Liu Bei, and the two betook themselves to the village inn to talk over the project."
正飲間，見一大漢，推著一輛車子，到店門首歇了；入店坐下，便喚酒保：「快斟酒來吃，我待趕入城去投軍。」玄德看其人：身長九尺，髯長二尺：面如重棗，脣若塗脂；丹鳳眼，臥蠶眉：相貌堂堂，威風凜凜。玄德就邀他同坐，叩其姓名。其人曰：「吾姓關，名羽，字壽長，後改雲長，河東解良人也。因本處勢豪，倚勢凌人，被吾殺了；逃難江湖，五六年矣。今聞此處招軍破賊，特來應募。」玄德遂以己志告之。雲長大喜。同到張飛莊上，共議大事。,"As they were drinking, a huge, tall fellow appeared pushing a hand-cart along the road. At the threshold he halted and entered the inn to rest awhile and he called for wine.""And be quick!"" added he. ""For I am in haste to get into the town and offer myself for the army.""Liu Bei looked over the newcomer, item by item, and he noted the man had a huge frame, a long beard, a vivid face like an apple, and deep red lips. He had eyes like a phoenix's and fine bushy eyebrows like silkworms. His whole appearance was dignified and awe-inspiring. Presently, Liu Bei crossed over, sat down beside him and asked his name.""I am Guan Yu,"" replied he. ""I am a native of the east side of the river, but I have been a fugitive on the waters for some five years, because I slew a ruffian who, since he was wealthy and powerful, was a bully. I have come to join the army here.""Then Liu Bei told Guan Yu his own intentions, and all three went away to Zhang Fei's farm where they could talk over the grand project."
飛曰：「吾莊後有一桃園，花開正盛；明日當於園中祭告天地，我三人結為兄弟，協力同心，然後可圖大事。」玄德、雲長、齊聲應曰：「如此甚好。」次日，於桃園中，備下烏牛白馬祭禮等項，三人焚香，再拜而說誓曰：「念劉備、關羽、張飛，雖然異姓，既結為兄弟，則同心協力，救困扶危；上報國家，下安黎庶；不求同年同月同日生，但願同年同月同日死。皇天后土，實鑒此心。背義忘恩，天人共戮。」誓畢，拜玄德為兄，關羽次之，張飛為弟。祭罷天地，復宰牛設酒，聚鄉中勇士，得三百餘人，就桃園中痛飲一醉。來日收拾軍器，但恨無馬匹可乘。,"Said Zhang Fei, ""The peach trees in the orchard behind the house are just in full flower. Tomorrow we will institute a sacrifice there and solemnly declare our intention before Heaven and Earth, and we three will swear brotherhood and unity of aims and sentiments: Thus will we enter upon our great task.""Both Liu Bei and Guan Yu gladly agreed.All three being of one mind, next day they prepared the sacrifices, a black ox, a white horse, and wine for libation. Beneath the smoke of the incense burning on the altar, they bowed their heads and recited this oath:""We three—-Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei—-though of different families, swear brotherhood, and promise mutual help to one end. We will rescue each other in difficulty; we will aid each other in danger. We swear to serve the state and save the people. We ask not the same day of birth, but we seek to die together. May Heaven, the all-ruling, and Earth, the all-producing, read our hearts. If we turn aside from righteousness or forget kindliness, may Heaven and Human smite us!""They rose from their knees. The two others bowed before Liu Bei as their elder brother, and Zhang Fei was to be the youngest of the trio. This solemn ceremony performed, they slew other oxen and made a feast to which they invited the villagers. Three hundred joined them, and all feasted and drank deep in the Peach Garden.The next day weapons were mustered. But there were no horses to ride. This was a real grief."
正思慮間，人報「有兩個客人，引一夥伴儅，趕一群馬，投莊上來。」玄德曰：「此天佑我也！」三人出莊迎接。原來二客乃中山大商：一名張世平，一名蘇雙，每年往北販馬，近因寇發而回。玄德請二人到莊，置酒管待，訴說欲討賊安民之意。二客大喜，願將良馬五十匹相送；又贈金銀五百兩，鑌鐵一千斤，以資器用。玄德謝別二客，便命良匠打造雙股劍。雲長造青龍偃月刀，又名冷豔鋸，重八十二斤。張飛造丈八點鋼矛。各置全身鎧甲。共聚鄉勇五百餘人，來見鄒靖。鄒靖引見太守劉焉。三人參見畢，各通姓名。玄德說起宗派，劉焉大喜，遂認玄德為姪。,"But soon they were cheered by the arrival of two horse dealers with a drove of horses. ""Thus does Heaven help us!"" said Liu Bei.And the three brothers went forth to welcome the merchants. They were Zhang Shiping and Su Shuang from Zhongshan. They went northwards every year to buy horses. They were now on their way home because of the Yellow Scarves. The brothers invited them to the farm, where wine was served before them. Then Liu Bei told them of the plan to strive for tranquillity. Zhang Shiping and Su Shuang were glad and at once gave the brothers fifty good steeds, and beside, five hundred ounces of gold and silver and one thousand five hundred pounds of steel fit for the forging of weapons.The brothers expressed their gratitude, and the merchants took their leave. Then blacksmiths were summoned to forge weapons. For Liu Bei they made a pair of ancient swords; for Guan Yu they fashioned a long-handled, curve blade called Green-Dragon Saber, which weighed a full one hundred pounds; and for Zhang Fei they created a ten-foot spear called Serpent Halberd. Each too had a helmet and full armor.When weapons were ready, the troop, now five hundred strong, marched to Commander Zhou Jing, who presented them to Imperial Protector Liu Yan. When the ceremony of introduction was over, Liu Bei declared his ancestry, and Liu Yan at once accorded him the esteem due to a relation."
不數日，人報黃巾賊將程遠志統兵五萬來犯涿郡。劉焉令鄒靖引玄德等三人，統兵五百，前去破敵。玄德等欣然領軍前進，直至大興山下，與賊相見。賊眾皆披髮，以黃巾抹額。當下兩軍相對，玄德出馬，─左有雲長，右有翼德─，揚鞭大罵：「反國逆賊，何不早降！」,"Before many days it was announced that the rebellion had actually broken out, and a Yellow Scarves chieftain, Cheng Yuanzhi, had invaded the region with a body of fifty thousand rebels. Liu Yan bade Zhou Jing and the three brothers to go out to oppose them with the five hundred troops. Liu Bei joyfully undertook to lead the van and marched to the foot of the Daxing Hills where they saw the rebels. The rebels wore their hair flying about their shoulders, and their foreheads were bound with yellow scarves.When the two armies had been drawn up opposite each other, Liu Bei rode to the front, Guan Yu to his left, Zhang Fei to his right.Flourishing his whip, Liu Bei began to hurl reproaches at the rebels, crying, ""O malcontents! Why not dismount and be bound?"""
程遠志大怒，遣副將鄧茂出戰。張飛挺丈八蛇矛直出，手起處，刺中鄧茂心窩，翻身落馬。程遠志見折了鄧茂，拍馬舞刀，直取張飛。雲長舞動大刀，縱馬飛迎。程遠志見了，早吃一驚；措手不及，被雲長刀起處，揮為兩段。後人有詩讚二人曰：,"Their leader Cheng Yuanzhi, full of rage, sent out one general, Deng Mao, to begin the battle. At once rode forward Zhang Fei, his serpent halberd poised to strike. One thrust and Deng Mao rolled off his horse, pierced through the heart. At this Cheng Yuanzhi himself whipped up his steed and rode forth with sword raised ready to slay Zhang Fei. But Guan Yu swung up his ponderous green-dragon saber and rode at Cheng Yuanzhi. At the sight, fear seized upon Cheng Yuanzhi, and before he could defend himself, the great saber fell, cutting him in halves."
英雄發穎在今朝，一試矛兮一試刀。初出便將威力展，三分好把姓名標。,"Two heroes new to war's alarms, Ride boldly forth to try their arms.Their doughty deeds three kingdoms tell, And poets sing how these befell."
眾賊見程遠志被斬，皆倒戈而走。玄德揮軍追趕，投降者不計其數，大勝而回。劉焉親自迎接，賞勞軍士。次日，接得青州太守龔景牒文，言黃巾賊圍城將陷，乞賜救援。劉焉與玄德商議。玄德曰：「備願往救之。」劉焉令鄒靖將兵五千，同玄德，關，張，投青州來。賊眾見救軍至，分兵混戰。玄德兵寡不勝，退三十里下寨。玄德謂關、張曰、「賊眾我寡，必出奇兵，方可取勝。」乃分關公引一千軍伏山左，張飛引一千軍伏山右，鳴金為號，齊出接應。,"Their leader fallen, the rebels threw away their weapons and fled. The official soldiers dashed in among them. Many thousands surrendered and the victory was complete. Thus this part of the rebellion was broken up.On their return, Liu Yan personally met them and distributed rewards. But the next day, letters came from Imperial Protector Gong Jing of Qingzhou Region saying that the rebels were laying siege to the chief city and it was near falling. Help was needed quickly.""I will go,"" said Liu Bei as soon as he heard the news.And he set out at once with his own soldiers, reinforced by a body of five thousand under Zhou Jing. The rebels, seeing help coming, at once attacked most fiercely. The relieving force being comparatively small could not prevail and retired some ten miles, where they made a camp.""They are many and we but few,"" said Liu Bei to his brothers. ""We can only beat them by superior strategy.""So they prepared an ambush. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, each with a goodly party, went behind the hills, right and left, and there hid. When the gongs beat they were to move out to support the main army."
次日，玄德與鄒靖，引軍鼓譟而進。賊眾迎戰，玄德引軍便退。賊眾乘勢追趕，方過山嶺，玄德軍中一齊鳴金，左右兩軍齊出，玄德麾軍回身復殺。三路夾攻，賊眾大潰。直趕至青州城下，太守龔景亦率民兵出城助戰。賊勢大敗，剿戮極多，遂解青州之圍。後人有詩讚玄德曰：,"These preparations made, the drums rolled noisily for Liu Bei to advance. The rebels also came forward. But Liu Bei suddenly retired. Thinking this was their chance, the rebels pressed forward and were led over the hills. Then suddenly the gongs sounded for the ambush. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei poured out from right and left as Liu Bei faced around to meet the rebels. Under three-side attack, the rebels lost heavily and fled to the walls of Qingzhou City. But Imperial Protector Gong Jing led out an armed body to attack them, and the rebels were entirely defeated and many slain. Qingzhou was no longer in danger."
運籌決算有神功，二虎還須遜一龍。初出便能垂偉績，自應分鼎在孤窮。,"Though fierce as tigers soldiers be, Battles are won by strategy.A hero comes; he gains renown, Already destined for a crown."
龔景犒軍畢，鄒靖欲回。玄德曰：「近聞中郎將盧植與賊首張角戰於廣宗，備昔曾師事盧植，欲往助之。」於是鄒靖引軍自回，玄德與關、張引本部五百人投廣宗來。至盧植軍中，入帳施禮，具道來意。盧植大喜，留在帳前聽調。,"After the celebrations in honor of victory were over, Commander Zhou Jing proposed to return to Youzhou.But Liu Bei said, ""We are informed that Imperial Commander Lu Zhi has been struggling with a horde of rebels led by Zhang Jue at Guangzong. Lu Zhi was once my teacher, and I want to go help him.""So Liu Bei and Zhou Jing separated, and the three brothers with their troops made their way to Guangzong. They found Lu Zhi's camp, were admitted to his presence, and declared the reason of their coming. The Commander received them with great joy, and they remained with him while he made his plans."
時張角賊眾十五萬，植兵五萬，相拒於廣宗，未見勝負。植謂玄德曰：「我今圍賊在此，賊弟張梁，張寶在潁川，與皇甫嵩、朱雋對壘。汝可引本部人馬，我更助汝一千官軍，前去潁川打探消息，約期剿捕。」玄德領命，引軍星夜投潁川來。時皇甫嵩、朱雋領軍拒賊，賊戰不利，退入長社，依草結營。嵩與雋計曰：「賊依草結營，當用火攻之。」遂令軍士，每人束草一把，暗地埋伏。其夜大風忽起。二更以後，一齊縱火，嵩與雋各引兵攻擊賊寨，火燄張天，賊眾驚慌，馬不及鞍，人不及甲，四散奔走。殺到天明，張梁、張寶引敗殘軍士，奪路而走。,"At that time Zhang Jue's one hundred fifty thousand troops and Lu Zhi's fifty thousand troops were facing each other. Neither had had any success.Lu Zhi said to Liu Bei, ""I am able to surround these rebels here. But the other two brothers, Zhang Ba and Zhang Lian, are strongly entrenched opposite Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun at Yingchuan. I will give you a thousand more troops, and with these you can go to find out what is happening, and we can then settle the moment for concerted attack.""So Liu Bei set off and marched as quickly as possible to Yingchuan. At that time the imperial troops were attacking with success, and the rebels had retired upon Changshe. They had encamped among the thick grass.Seeing this, Huangfu Song said to Zhu Jun, ""The rebels are camping in the field. We can attack them by fire.""So the Imperial Commanders bade every man cut a bundle of dry grass and laid an ambush. That night the wind blew a gale, and at the second watch they started a blaze. At the same time Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun's troops attacked the rebels and set their camp on fire. The flames rose to the very heaven. The rebels were thrown into great confusion. There was no time to saddle horses or don armor: They fled in all directions. The battle continued until dawn. Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao, with a group of flying rebels, found a way of escape."
忽見一彪軍馬，盡打紅旗，當頭來到，截往去路。為首閃出一將，身長七尺，細眼長髯；官拜騎都尉；沛國譙郡人也：姓曹，名操，字孟德。操父曹嵩，本姓夏侯氏；因為中常侍曹騰之養子，故冒姓曹。曹嵩生操，小字阿瞞，一名吉利。操幼時，好游獵，喜歌舞；有權謀，多機變。操有叔父，見操游蕩無度，嘗怒之，言於曹嵩。嵩責操。操忽心生一計：見叔父來，詐倒於地，作中風之狀。叔父驚告嵩，嵩急視之，操故無恙。嵩曰：「叔言汝中風，今己愈乎？」操曰：「兒自來無此病；因失愛於叔父，故見罔耳。」嵩信其言。後叔父但言操過，嵩並不聽。因此，操得恣意放蕩。,"But suddenly a troop of soldiers with crimson banners appeared to oppose them. Their leader was a man of medium stature with small eyes and a long beard. He was Cao Cao, a Beijuo man, holding the rank of Cavalry Commander. His father was Cao Song, but he was not really a Cao. Cao Song had been born to the Xiahou family, but he had been brought up by Eunuch Cao Teng and had taken this family name.As a young man Cao Cao had been fond of hunting and delighted in songs and dancing. He was resourceful and full of guile. An uncle, seeing the young fellow so unsteady, used to get angry with him and told his father of his misdeeds. His father remonstrated with him.But Cao Cao made equal to the occasion. One day, seeing his uncle coming, he fell to the ground in a pretended fit. The uncle alarmed ran to tell his father, who came, and there was the youth in most perfect health.""But your uncle said you were in a fit. Are you better?"" said his father.""I have never suffered from fits or any such illness,"" said Cao Cao. ""But I have lost my uncle's affection, and he has deceived you.""Thereafter, whatever the uncle might say of his faults, his father paid no heed. So the young man grew up licentious and uncontrolled."
時人有橋玄者，謂操曰：「天下將亂，非命世之才，不能濟。能安之者，其在君乎？」南陽何顒見操，言：「漢室將亡，安天下者，必此人也。」汝南許劭，有知人之名。操往見之，問曰：「我何如人？」劭不答。又問，劭曰：「子治世之能臣，亂世之奸雄也。」操聞言大喜。年二十，舉孝廉，為郎，除洛陽北都尉。初到任，即設五色棒十餘條於縣之四門。有犯禁者，不避豪貴，皆責之。中常侍蹇碩之叔，提刀夜行，操巡夜拏住，就棒責之。由是，內外莫敢犯者，威名頗震。後為頓丘令。因黃巾起，拜為騎都尉，引馬步軍五千，前來潁川助戰。正值張梁、張寶敗走，曹操攔住，大殺一陣，斬首萬餘級，奪得旗旛、金鼓馬匹極多。張梁、張寶死戰得脫。操見過皇甫嵩，朱雋，隨即引兵追襲張梁、張寶去了。,"A man of the time named Qiao Xuan said to Cao Cao, ""Rebellion is at hand, and only a man of the greatest ability can succeed in restoring tranquillity. That man is yourself.""And He Yong of Nanyang said of him, ""The dynasty of Han is about to fall. He who can restore peace is this man and only he.""Cao Cao went to inquire his future of a wise man of Runan named Xu Shao.""What manner of man am I?"" asked Cao Cao.The seer made no reply, and again and again Cao Cao pressed the question.Then Xu Shao replied, ""In peace you are an able subject; in chaos you are a crafty hero!""Cao Cao greatly rejoiced to hear this.Cao Cao graduated at twenty and earned a reputation of piety and integrity. He began his career as Commanding Officer in a county within the Capital District. In the four gates of the city he guarded, he hung up clubs of various sorts, and he would punish any breach of the law whatever the rank of the offender. Now an uncle of Eunuch Jian Shuo was found one night in the streets with a sword and was arrested. In due course he was beaten. Thereafter no one dared to offend again, and Cao Cao's name became heard. Soon he became a magistrate of Dunqiu.At the outbreak of the Yellow Scarves, Cao Cao held the rank of General and was given command of five thousand horse and foot to help fight at Yingchuan. He just happened to fall in with the newly defeated rebels whom he cut to pieces. Thousands were slain and endless banners and drums and horses were captured, together with huge sums of money. However, Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang got away; and after an interview with Huangfu Song, Cao Cao went in pursuit of them."
卻說玄德引關、張來潁川，聽得喊殺之聲，又望見火光燭天，急引兵來時，賊已敗散。玄德見皇甫嵩，朱雋，其道盧植之意。嵩曰：「張梁、張寶勢窮力乏，必投廣宗去依張角。玄德可即星夜往助。」,"Meanwhile Liu Bei and his brothers were hastening toward Yingchuan, when they heard the din of battle and saw flames rising high toward the sky. But they arrived too late for the fighting. They saw Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun to whom they told the intentions of Lu Zhi.""The rebel power is quite broken here,"" said the commanders, ""but they will surely make for Guangzong to join Zhang Jue. You can do nothing better than hasten back."""
玄德領命，遂引兵復回。到得半路，只見一簇軍馬，護送一輛檻車，車中之囚，乃盧植也。玄德大驚，滾鞍下馬，問其緣故。植曰：「我圍張角，將次可破；因角用妖術，未能即勝。朝廷差黃門左豐前來體探，問我索取賄賂。我答曰：『軍糧尚缺，安有餘錢奉承天使？』左豐挾恨，回奏朝廷，說我高壘不戰，惰慢軍心；因此朝廷震怒，遣中郎將董卓來代將我兵，取我回京問罪。」,"The three brothers thus retraced their steps. Half way along the road they met a party of soldiers escorting a prisoner in a cage-cart. When they drew near, they saw the prisoner was no other than Lu Zhi, the man they were going to help. Hastily dismounting, Liu Bei asked what had happened.Lu Zhi explained, ""I had surrounded the rebels and was on the point of smashing them, when Zhang Jue employed some of his supernatural powers and prevented my victory. The court sent down Eunuch Zhuo Feng to inquire into my failure, and that official demanded a bribe. I told him how hard pressed we were and asked him where, in the circumstances, I could find a gift for him. He went away in wrath and reported that I was hiding behind my ramparts and would not give battle and that I disheartened my army. So I was superseded by Dong Zhuo, and I have to go to the capital to answer the charge."""
張飛聽罷，大怒，要斬護送軍人，以救盧植。玄德急止之曰：「朝廷自有公論，汝豈可造次？」軍士簇擁盧植去了。關公曰：「盧中郎已被逮，別人領兵，我等去無所依，不如且回涿郡。」玄德從其言，遂引軍北行。,"This story put Zhang Fei into a rage. He was for slaying the escort and setting free Lu Zhi. But Liu Bei checked him.""The government will take the due course,"" said Liu Bei. ""You must not act hastily!""And the escort and the three brothers went two ways.It was useless to continue on that road to Guangzong, so Guan Yu proposed to go back to Zhuo, and they retook the road."
行無二日，忽聞山後喊聲大震。玄德引關、張縱馬上高岡望之，見漢軍大敗，後面漫山塞野，黃巾蓋地而來，旗上大書「天公將軍」。玄德曰：「此張角也！可速戰！」,"Two days later they heard the thunder of battle behind some hills. Hastening to the top, they beheld the government soldiers suffering great loss, and they saw the countryside was full of Yellow Scarves. On the rebels' banners were the words Zhang Jue the Lord of Heaven written large.""We will attack this Zhang Jue!"" said Liu Bei to his brothers, and they galloped out to join in the battle."
三人飛馬引軍而出。張角正殺敗董卓，乘勢趕來，忽遇三人衝殺，角軍大亂，敗走五十餘里。三人救了董卓回寨。卓問三人現居何職。玄德曰：「白身。」卓甚輕之，不為禮。玄德出，張飛大怒曰：「我等親赴血戰，救了這廝，他卻如此無禮；若不殺之，難消我氣！」便要提刀入帳來殺董卓。正是：人情勢利古猶今，誰識英雄是白身？安得快人如翼德，盡誅世上負心人！畢竟董卓性命如何，且看下文分解。,"Zhang Jue had worsted Dong Zhuo and was following up his advantage. He was in hot pursuit when the three brothers dashed into his army, threw his ranks into confusion, and drove him back fifteen miles. Then the brothers returned with the rescued general to his camp.""What offices have you?"" asked Dong Zhuo, when he had leisure to speak to the brothers.""None,"" replied they.And Dong Zhuo treated them with disrespect. Liu Bei retired calmly, but Zhang Fei was furious.""We have just rescued this menial in a bloody fight,"" cried Zhang Fei, ""and now he is rude to us! Nothing but his death can slake my anger.""Zhang Fei stamped toward Dong Zhuo's tent, holding firmly a sharp sword.As it was in olden time so it is today, The simple wight may merit well,Officialdom holds sway; Zhang Fei, the blunt and hasty,Where can you find his peer? But slaying the ungrateful wouldMean many deaths a year. Dong Zhuo's fate will be unrolled in later chapters."
