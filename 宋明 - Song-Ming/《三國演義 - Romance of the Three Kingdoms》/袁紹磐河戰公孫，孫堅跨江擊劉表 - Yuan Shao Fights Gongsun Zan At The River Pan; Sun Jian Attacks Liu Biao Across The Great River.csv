卻說孫堅被劉表圍住，虧得程普，黃蓋，韓當，三將死救得脫，折兵大半，奪路引兵回江東。自此孫堅與劉表結怨。,"At the close of the last chapter Sun Jian was surrounded. However, aided by Cheng Pu, Huang Gai, and Han Dang, he eventually fought his way through, though with the loss of more than half his troops. Sun Jian returned to the South Land, the territories southeast of the Great River. Henceforward Sun Jian and Liu Biao were open enemies."
且說袁紹屯兵河內，缺少糧草。冀州牧韓馥，遣人送糧以資軍用。謀士逢紀說紹曰：「大丈夫縱橫天下，何待人送糧為食？冀州乃錢糧廣盛之地，將軍何不取之？」紹曰：「未有良策。」紀曰：「可暗使人馳書與公孫瓚，令進兵取冀州，約以夾攻，瓚必興兵。韓馥無謀之輩，必請將軍領州事；就中取事，唾手可得。」,"Yuan Shao was in Henei. Being short of supplies, he sent to borrow from the Imperial Protector of Jizhou, Han Fu, whence he obtained the wherewithal to support his army.Then one of Yuan Shao's advisers, Peng Ji, said to him, ""You are really the strongest power here about. Why then depend upon another for food? Jizhou Region is rich and wide. Why not seize it?""""I have no good plan,"" replied Yuan Shao.""You could secretly send a letter to Gongsun Zan, asking him to attack, promising him your support. Imperial Protector Han Fu of Jizhou, being incapable, must ask you to take over his region, and you will get it without lifting a finger."""
紹大喜，即發書到瓚處。瓚得書，見說共攻冀州，平分其地，大喜，即日興兵。紹卻使人密報韓馥。馥慌聚荀諶，辛評，二謀士商議。諶曰：「公孫瓚將燕、代之眾，長驅而來，其鋒不可當。兼有劉備、關、張助之，難以抵敵。今袁本初智勇過人，手下名將極廣，將軍可請彼同治州事，彼必厚待將軍，無患公孫瓚矣。」,"So the letter was sent. When Gongsun Zan saw therein the proposal to make a joint attack and divide the territory, he agreed to give his help. In the meantime Yuan Shao had sent to warn Han Fu of Gongsun Zan's threat. Han Fu sought advice from Counselors Xun Chang and Xin Ping.Xun Chang said, ""Governor Gongsun Zan of Beiping is commanding a huge and strong army. If he came to attack us, we could not stand against him, especially if he had the help of Liu Bei and his brothers. At present, Yuan Shao is bolder than most, and he has many able and famous leaders under him. You cannot do better than ask him to assist in administering this region. Yuan Shao will certainly treat you with generosity, and you need have no fear from Gongsun Zan."""
韓馥即差別駕關純去請袁紹。長史耿武諫曰：「袁紹孤客窮軍，仰我鼻息，譬如嬰兒在股掌之上，絕其乳哺，立可餓死。奈何欲以州事委之？此引虎入羊群也。」馥曰：「吾乃袁氏之故吏，才能又不如本初。古者擇賢者而讓之，諸君何嫉妒耶？」耿武歎曰：「冀州休矣！」於是棄職而去者三十餘人。獨耿武與關純伏於城外，以待袁紹。,"Han Fu agreed and sent a message to Yuan Shao by the hand of Guan Chun.But Commander Geng Wu remonstrated with his master, saying, ""Yuan Shao is a needy man with a hungry army and as dependent on us for existence as an infant in the arms of its mother. Stop the flow of milk and the infant dies. Why should you hand the region over to him? It is nothing less than letting a tiger into the sheepfold!""Han Fu replied, ""I am one of the clients of the Yuan family, and I know the abilities of Yuan Shao, which is far better than mine! Why are you all so jealous? The ancients counseled yielding to the sage.""Geng Wu sighed, ""Jizhou is lost!""When the news got abroad, more than thirty officers of Jizhou left their employment and the city. However, Geng Wu and Guan Chun hid in the suburbs to await the arrival of Yuan Shao."
數日後，紹引兵至。耿武、關純拔刀而出，欲刺殺紹。紹將顏良立斬耿武，文醜砍死關純。紹入冀州，以馥為奮威將軍，以田豐，沮授，許攸，逢紀分掌州事，盡奪韓馥之權。馥懊悔無及，遂棄下家小，匹馬往投陳留太守張邈去了。,"They had not long to wait. Some days later, Yuan Shao with his soldiers came, and Geng Wu and Guan Chun tried to assassinate him with knives. This attempt failed. Yuan Shao's generals, Yan Liang and Wen Chou, beheaded Geng Wu and Guan Chun instantly. Thus both of them died, and the object of their hatred entered Jizhou City.Yuan Shao's first act was to confer on Han Fu a high sounding title —-General Who Demonstrates Grand and Vigor Courage in Arms —-, but the administration was entrusted to four of Yuan Shao's confidants —-Tian Feng, Ju Shou, Xu You, and Peng Ji —-who speedily deprived the Imperial Protector of all power. Full of chagrin, Han Fu soon abandoned all, even his family, and rode alone to take refuge with the Governor of Chenliu, Zhang Miao."
卻說公孫瓚知袁紹己據冀州，遣弟公孫越來見紹，欲分其地。紹曰：「可請汝兄自來，吾有商議。」越辭歸。行不到五十里，道旁閃出一彪軍馬，口稱：「我乃董丞相家將也！」亂箭射死公孫越。從人逃回見公孫瓚，報越已死。瓚大怒曰：「袁紹誘我起兵攻韓馥，他卻就裏取事；今又詐董卓兵射死吾弟，此冤如何不報！」盡起本部兵，殺奔冀州來。,"Hearing of Yuan Shao's invasion, Gongsun Zan sent his brother, Gongsun Yue, to see the usurper and demand his share of the region.""I want to see your elder brother himself. He and I have things to discuss,"" said Yuan Shao.Thus Gongsun Yue was sent back. But after traveling some fifteen miles on the homeward road, Gongsun Yue saw a group of soldiers appear.""We are guards of Prime Minister Dong Zhuo!"" cried the soldiers.Instantly, Gongsun Yue was killed by a flight of arrows. Those of Gongsun Yue's followers who escaped carried the news to their late master's brother.Gongsun Zan was very angry and said, ""Yuan Shao prevailed on me to attack, and now he has taken possession! Also he pretends the murderers of my brother were not his people! Shall I not avenge my brother's injury?"" Gongsun Zan brought up all his force to the attack."
紹知瓚兵至，亦領軍出。二軍會於磐河之上：紹軍於磐河橋東，瓚軍於橋西。瓚立馬橋上，大呼曰：「背義之徒，何敢賣我！」紹亦策馬至橋邊，指瓚曰：「韓馥無才，願讓冀州於吾，與爾何干？」瓚曰：「昔日以汝為忠義，推為盟主；今之所為，真狼心狗行之徒，有何面目立於世間！」袁紹大怒曰：「誰可擒之？」,"Learning the movement, Yuan Shao sent out his army, and they met at River Pan. They halted on opposite sides of the river, over which was a bridge.Gongsun Zan took his station on the bridge and cried to his enemy, ""Renegade, how dared you mislead me?""Yuan Shao rode to the other end of the bridge and, pointing at Gongsun Zan, replied, ""Han Fu yielded place to me because he was unequal to the rule! What concern is it of yours?""Gongsun Zan replied, ""Formerly you were regarded as loyal and public spirited, and we chose you chief of the confederacy. Now your deeds prove you cruel and base and wolf-hearted in behavior! How can you look the world in the face?""""Who will capture him?"" cried Yuan Shao in a rage."
言未畢，文醜策馬挺鎗，直殺上橋。公孫瓚就橋邊與文醜交鋒。戰不到十餘合，瓚抵擋不住，敗陣而走。文醜乘勢追趕。瓚走入陣中，文醜飛馬逕入中軍，往來衝突。瓚手下健將四員，一齊迎戰；被文醜一鎗，刺一將下馬，三將俱走。文醜直趕公孫瓚出陣後，瓚望山谷而逃。文醜驟馬厲聲大叫：「快下馬受降！」瓚弓箭盡落，頭盔墮地；披髮縱馬，奔轉山坡；其馬前失，瓚翻身落於坡下。文醜急捻鎗來刺。忽見草坡左側轉出一個少年將軍，飛馬挺鎗，直取文醜。,"At once Wen Chou rode out with his spear set. Gongsun Zan rode down the bridge to the enemy's side, where the two engaged. Ten bouts showed Gongsun Zan the terrible power of Wen Chou, and so he drew off. The enemy came on. Gongsun Zan took refuge within his formation, but Wen Chou cut his way in and rode this way and that, slaying right and left. The four best of Gongsun Zan's generals offered joint battle, but one fell under the first stroke of the doughty warrior, and the other three fled. Wen Chou followed, clearing through to the rear of the army. Gongsun Zan made for the mountains.Wen Chou forced his horse to its utmost pace, crying hoarsely, ""Down! Dismount and surrender!""Gongsun Zan fled for life. His bow and quiver dropped from his shoulders, his helmet fell off, and his hair streamed straight behind him as he rode in and out between the sloping hills. Then his steed stumbled and he was thrown, rolling over and over to the foot of the slope.Wen Chou was now very near and poising his spear for the thrust. Then suddenly came out from the shelter of a grassy mound on the left a general of youthful mien, but sitting his steed bravely and holding a sturdy spear. He rode directly at Wen Chou."
公孫瓚爬上坡去，看那少年：生得身長八尺，濃眉大眼，闊面重頤，威風凜凜，與文醜大戰五六十合，勝負未分。瓚部下救軍到，文醜撥馬回去了。那少年也不追趕。瓚忙下土坡，問那少年姓名。那少年欠身答曰：「某乃常山真定人也：姓趙，名雲，字子龍；本袁紹轄下之人。因見紹無忠君救民之心，故特棄彼而投麾下不期於此處相見。」瓚大喜，遂同歸寨，整頓甲兵。,"Gongsun Zan crawled up the slope to look on. The new warrior was of middle height with bushy eyebrows and large eyes, a broad face and a heavy jowl, a youth of commanding presence. The two exchanged some fifty bouts and yet neither had the advantage. Then Gongsun Zan's rescue force came along, and Wen Chou turned and rode away. The warrior did not pursue.Gongsun Zan hurried down the hill and asked the young fellow who he was.He bowed low and replied, ""My name is Zhao Zilong from Changshan. I first served Yuan Shao; but when I saw that he was disloyal to his prince and careless of the welfare of the people, I left him and I was on my way to offer service to you. This meeting in this place is most unexpected.""Gongsun Zan was very pleased, and the two went together to the camp, where they at once busied themselves with preparations for a new battle."
次日，瓚將軍馬分作左右兩隊，勢如羽翼。馬五千餘匹，大半皆是白馬。因公孫瓚曾與羌人戰，盡選白馬為先鋒，號為「白馬將軍」；羌人但見白馬便走，因此白馬極多。袁紹令顏良、文醜為先鋒，各引弓弩手一千，亦分作左右兩隊；令在左者射公孫瓚右軍，在右者射公孫瓚左軍。再令麴義引八百弓手，步兵一萬五千，列於陣中。袁紹自引馬步軍數萬，於後接應。,"Next day Gongsun Zan prepared for fight by dividing his army into two wings. He had five thousand cavalry in the center, all mounted on white horses. Gongsun Zan had formerly seen service against the northern frontier tribes, the Qiang Peoples, where he always placed his white horses in the van of his army, and thus he had won the sobriquet of General Who Commands White Horses. The tribes held him so much in fear that they always fled as soon as the white horses, their sacred creatures, appeared.On Yuan Shao's side Yan Liang and Wen Chou were Leaders of the Van. Each had one thousand of archers and crossbowmen. They were set out half on either side, those on the left to shoot at Gongsun Zan's right and those on the right to shoot at his left. In the center was Qu Yi with eight hundred bowmen and ten thousand of foot and horse. Yuan Shao took command of the reserve force in the rear."
公孫瓚初得趙雲，不知心腹，令其另領一軍在後。遣大將嚴綱為先鋒。瓚自領中軍，立馬橋上，傍豎大紅圈金線「帥」字旗於馬前。從辰時擂鼓，直至巳時，紹軍不進。麴義令弓手皆伏於遮箭下，只聽砲響發箭。嚴綱鼓譟吶喊，直取麴義，義軍見嚴綱兵來，都伏而不動；直到來得至近，一聲砲響，八百弓弩手一齊俱發。綱急得回，被麴義拍馬舞刀，斬於馬下，瓚軍大敗。左右兩軍，欲來救應，被被顏良、文醜引弓弩手射住。紹軍並進，直殺到界橋邊麴義馬到，先斬執旗將，把繡旗砍倒。,"In this fight Gongsun Zan employed his new adherent Zhao Zilong for the first time and, as Gongsun Zan did not feel assured of Zhao Zilong's good faith, put him in command of a company at the rear. The Van Leader was Yan Guang, and Gongsun Zan himself commanded the center. He took his place on horseback on the bridge beside an enormous red standard on which was displayed the words Commanding General in gold embroidery.From sunrise to noon the drums rolled for the attack, but Yuan Shao's army made no move. Qu Yi made his bowmen hide under their shields. They heard the roar of explosions, the whistling of arrows, and the rattle of the drums, as Yan Guang approached from the other side, but Qu Yi and his men lay closer than ever and never stirred. They waited till Yan Guang had got close on them and then, as the sound of a bomb rent the air, the whole eight hundred men let fly their arrows in a cloud. Yan Guang was quite taken aback and would have retired, but Qu Yi rode furiously toward him, whirled up his sword and cut him down.So Gongsun Zan's army lost that battle. The two wings that should have come to the rescue were kept back by the bowmen under Yan Liang and Wen Chou. Yuan Shao's troops advanced right up to the bridge. Then Qu Yi rode forward, slew the standard bearer, and hacked through the staff of the embroidered banner."
公孫瓚見砍倒繡旗，回馬下橋而走。麴義引軍直衝到後軍，正撞著趙雲，挺鎗躍馬，直取麴義。戰不數合，一鎗刺麴義於馬下。趙雲一騎馬飛入紹軍，左衝右突，如入無人之境。公孫瓚引軍殺回，紹軍大敗。,"Seeing this, Gongsun Zan turned his steed and galloped away. Qu Yi followed. But just as he caught up the fugitive, there came prancing forth Zhao Zilong, who rode directly at him with spear ready to strike. After a few bouts Qu Yi was laid in the dust. Then Zhao Zilong attacked the soldiers and turned the tide. Plunging forward on this side, dashing in on that, he went through as if there were no antagonists and, seeing this, Gongsun Zan turned and came again into the fight. The final victory was on his side."
卻說袁紹先使探馬看時，回報麴義斬將搴旗，追趕敗兵；因此不作準備，與田豐引著帳下持戟軍士數百人，弓箭手數十騎，乘馬出觀，呵呵大笑曰：「公孫瓚無能之輩！」,"From the scouts sent to find out how the battle went, Yuan Shao heard the good news of Qu Yi's success in slaying the standard bearer, capturing the flag, and his pursuit. So Yuan Shao took no further care but rode out with Tian Feng and a few guards to look on at the enemy and enjoy his victory.""Ha ha!"" Yuan Shao laughed. ""Gongsun Zan is an incapable!"""
正說之間，忽見趙雲衝到面前。弓箭手急待射時，雲連刺數人，眾軍皆走。後面瓚軍團團圍裹上來。田豐慌對紹曰：「主公且於空牆中躲避！」紹以兜鍪撲地，大呼曰：「大丈夫願臨陣鬥死，豈可入牆而望活乎！」眾軍士齊心死戰，趙雲衝突不入，紹兵大隊掩至，顏良亦引軍來到，兩路并殺。趙雲保公孫瓚殺透重圍，回到界橋。紹驅兵大進，復趕過橋，落水死者，不計其數。袁紹當先趕來，不到五里，只聽得山背後喊聲大起，閃出一彪人馬，為首三員大將，乃是劉玄德，關雲長，張翼德。因在平原探知公孫瓚與袁紹相爭，特來助戰。當下三匹馬，三般兵器，飛奔前來，直取袁紹。紹驚得魂飛天外，手中寶刀墜於馬下，忙撥馬而逃，眾人死救過橋。公孫瓚亦收軍歸寨。玄德、關、張動問畢，瓚曰：「若非玄德遠來救我，幾乎狼狽。」教與趙雲相見。玄德甚相敬愛，便有不捨之心。,"But even as Yuan Shao spoke, he saw in front the redoubtable Zhao Zilong. His guards hastened to prepare their bows, but before they could shoot, Zhao Zilong was in their midst, and men were falling before him wherever he went. The others fled. Gongsun Zan's army then gathered round and hemmed in Yuan Shao.Tian Feng then said to his master, ""Sir, take refuge in this empty building here!""But Yuan Shao dashed his helmet to the ground, crying, ""The brave person rather faces death in the battle than seeks safety behind a wall!""This bold speech gave new courage to his soldiers who now fought fiercely and with such success that Zhao Zilong could nowhere force his way in. Yuan Shao was soon reinforced by the arrival of his main body and Yan Liang, and the two armies pressed forward. Zhao Zilong could only just get Gongsun Zan safe out of the press. Then they fought their way back to the bridge. But Yuan Shao's troops still came on and fought their way across the bridge, forcing multitudes of their adversaries into the water, where many were drowned.Yuan Shao was leading in person and his troops still advanced. But not more than two miles, for soon a great shouting was heard behind some hills, whence suddenly burst out a body of troops led by Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei.At Pingyuan they had heard of the struggle between their protector and his enemy, Yuan Shao, and had at once set out to help. Now the three riders, each with his peculiar weapon, flew straight at Yuan Shao, who was so frightened that his soul seemed to leave his body and fly beyond the confines of heaven.His sword fell from his hand and he fled for his life. He was chased across the bridge when Gongsun Zan called in his army, and they returned to camp.After the usual greetings Gongsun Zan said, ""If you had not come to our help, we should have been in very bad case.""Liu Bei and Zhao Zilong were made acquainted with each other, and a warm affection sprang up from the very first so that they were always together."
卻說袁紹輸了一陣，堅守不出。兩軍相拒月餘，有人來長安報知董卓。李儒對卓曰：「袁紹與公孫瓚，亦當今豪傑。見在磐河廝殺，宜假天子之詔，差人往和解之。二人感德，必順太師矣。」卓大喜。次日便使太傅馬日磾、太僕趙岐，齎詔前去。二人來至河北，紹出迎於百里之外，再拜奉詔。次日二人至瓚營宣諭，瓚乃遣使致書於紹，互相講和；二人自回京復命。瓚即日班師，又表薦劉玄德為平原相。玄德與趙雲分別，執手垂淚，不忍相離。雲歎曰：「某日誤認公孫瓚為英雄；今觀所為，亦袁紹等輩耳！」玄德曰：「公且屈身事之，相見有日。」灑淚而別。,"Yuan Shao had lost that battle, and Gongsun Zan would not risk another. They strengthened their defenses, and the armies lay inactive for over a month. In the meantime news of the fighting had reached Capital Changan, and Dong Zhuo was told.His adviser, Li Ru, went to see his master and said, ""The two active leaders of today are Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan, who are at grips at River Pan. Pretend you have an imperial command to make peace between them, and both will support you out of gratitude for your intervention.""""Good!"" said Dong Zhuo.So he sent Imperial Guardian Ma Midi and Court Administrator Zhao Qi on the mission. When these men were arriving at the North of Yellow River, Yuan Shao sent out to welcome them thirty miles from his headquarters and received the imperial command with the greatest respect. Then the two officers went to Gongsun Zan and made known their errand. Gongsun Zan sent letters to his adversary proposing friendship. The two emissaries returned to report their task accomplished. Gongsun Zan drew off his army. He also sent up a memorial eulogizing Liu Bei, who was raised to the rank of Governor of Pingyuan.The farewell between Liu Bei and Zhao Zilong was affecting. They held each other's hands a long time, their eyes streaming with tears, and could not tear themselves apart.Zhao Zilong said with a sob, ""I used to think Gongsun Zan a true hero, but I see now that he is no different from Yuan Shao. They are both alike.""""But you are now in his service. We shall surely meet again,"" said Liu Bei.Both men wept freely as they separated."
卻說袁術在南陽，聞袁紹新得冀州，遣使來求馬千匹。紹不與，術怒。自此，兄弟不睦。又遣使往荊州，問劉表借糧二十萬，表亦不與。術恨之，密遣人遺書於孫堅，使伐劉表。其書略曰：前者劉表截路，乃吾兄本初之謀也。今本初又與表私議欲襲江東。公可速興兵伐劉表，吾為公取本初，二讎可報。公取荊州，吾取冀州，切勿誤也！,"Now Yuan Shu in Nanyang, hearing that his brother had come into Jizhou, sent to beg a thousand horses. The request was refused and enmity sprang up between the brothers. Yuan Shu also sent to Jingzhou to borrow grain, which Imperial Protector Liu Biao would not send. In his resentment, Yuan Shu wrote to Sun Jian, Governor of Changsha, trying to get him to attack Liu Biao. The letter ran like this:""When Liu Biao stopped you on your way home, it was at the instigation of my brother. Now the same two have planned to fall upon your territories in the South Land, wherefore you should at once strike at Liu Biao. I will capture my brother for you and both resentments will be appeased. You will get Jingzhou, and I shall have Jizhou."""
堅得書曰：「叵耐劉表！昔日斷吾歸路，今不乘時報恨，更待何時！」聚帳下程普，黃蓋，韓當等商議。程普曰：「袁術多詐，未可准信。」堅曰：「吾自欲報讎，豈望袁術之助乎？」便差黃蓋先來江邊，安排戰船，多裝軍器糧草，大船裝載戰馬，剋日興師。江中細作探知，來報劉表。表大驚，急聚文武將士商議。蒯良曰：「不必憂慮。可令黃祖部領江夏之兵為前驅，主公率荊襄之眾為援。孫堅跨江涉湖而來，安能用武乎？」表然之，令黃祖設備，隨後便起大軍。,"""I cannot bear Liu Biao,"" said Sun Jian as he finished reading this letter. ""He certainly did bar my way home, and I may wait many years for my revenge if I let slip this chance!""He called a council.""You may not trust Yuan Shu. He is very deceitful,"" said Cheng Pu.""I want revenge on my own part. What care I for his help?"" said Sun Jian.He dispatched Huang Gai to prepare a river fleet, arm and provision them. Big warships were to take horses on board. The force soon set out.News of these preparations came to Liu Biao, and he hastily summoned his advisers and commanders.Kuai Liang told him to be free from anxiety, and said, ""Put General Huang Zu at the head of the Jiangxia army to make the first attack and you, Sir, support him with the forces from Xiangyang. Let Sun Jian come riding the rivers and straddling the lakes: What strength will he have left after arriving here?""So Liu Biao bade Huang Zu prepare to march, and a great army was assembled."
卻說孫堅有四子，皆吳夫人所生：長子名策，字伯符；次子名權，字仲謀；三子名翊，字叔弼；四子名匡，字季佐。吳夫人之妹，即為孫堅次妻，亦生一子一女：子名朗，字早安；女名仁。堅又過房俞氏一子，名韶，字公禮。堅有一弟，名靜，字幼臺。,"Here it may be said that Sun Jian had four sons, all the issue of his wife who was of the Wu family. Their names in order were Sun Ce, Sun Quan, Sun Yi, and Sun Kuang. Sun Jian had a second wife who was the sister of his first wife. And the second wife bore him a son and a daughter, the former called Sun Lang, the latter Sun Ren. Sun Jian had also adopted a son from a Yu family and named him Sun Hu. And he had a younger brother named Sun Jing."
堅臨行，靜引諸子列拜於馬前而諫曰：「今董卓專權，天子懦弱，海內大亂，各霸一方；江東方稍寧，以一小恨而起重兵，非所宜也：願兄詳之。」堅曰：「弟勿多言。吾將縱橫天下，有讎豈可不報！」長子孫策曰：「如父親必欲往，兒願隨行。」堅許之，遂與策登舟，殺奔樊城。,"As Sun Jian was leaving on this expedition, his brother Sun Jing with all his six sons stood in front of his steed and dissuaded him, saying, ""Dong Zhuo is the real ruler of the state, for the Emperor is a weakling. The whole country is in rebellion, everyone is scrambling for territory. Our area is comparatively peaceful, and it is wrong to begin a war merely for the sake of a little resentment. I pray you, brother, think before you start.""Sun Jian replied, ""Brother, say no more. I desire to make my strength felt throughout the empire, and shall I not avenge my injuries?""""Then Father, if you must go, let me accompany you,"" said the eldest son Sun Ce.This request was granted, and father and son embarked to go to ravage the city of Fankou."
黃祖伏弓弩手於江邊，見船傍岸，亂箭俱發。堅令諸軍不可輕動，只伏於船中來往誘之；一連三日，船數十次傍岸。黃祖軍只顧放箭，箭已放盡。堅卻拔船上所得之箭，約十數萬。當日正值順風，堅令軍士一齊放箭。岸上支吾不住，只得退走。,"Now Huang Zu had placed archers and crossbowmen along the river bank. When the ships approached, a flight of arrows met them. Sun Jian ordered his troops to remain under cover in the ships, which then sailed to and fro, drawing the fire for three days. Several times the ships pretended to land, and this drew showers of arrows from the bank. At last the arrows of the defenders were all shot away and Sun Jian, who collected them, found he had many myriads. Then with a fair wind Sun Jian's troops shot them back to the enemy. Those on the bank were thrown into great disorder and retired."
堅軍登岸，程普，黃蓋，分兵兩路，直取黃祖營寨。背後韓當驅兵大進。三面夾攻，黃祖大敗，棄卻樊城，退入鄧城。堅令黃蓋守住船隻，親自統兵追襲。黃祖引軍出迎，布陣於野。堅列成陣勢，出馬於門旗之下。孫策也全副披掛，挺鎗立馬於父側。黃祖引二將出馬：一個是江夏張虎，一個是襄陽陳生。黃祖揚鞭大罵：「江東鼠賊，安敢侵犯漢室宗親境界！」便令張虎搦戰。堅陣內韓當出迎。兩騎相交，戰三十餘合，陳生見張虎力怯，飛馬來助。孫策望見，按住手中鎗，扯弓撘箭，正射中陳生面門，應弦落馬。張虎見陳生墜地，吃了一驚，措手不及，被韓當一刀，削去半個腦袋。程普縱馬直來陣前捉黃祖。黃祖棄卻頭盔、戰馬，雜於步軍內逃命。孫堅掩殺敗軍，直到漢水，命黃蓋將船隻進泊漢江。,"The army then landed. Two divisions led by Cheng Pu and Huang Gai set out for Huang Zu's camp along different roads, and between them marched Han Dang. Under this triple attack Huang Zu was worsted. He left Fankou and hastened to Dengcheng.Leaving the ships under the command of Huang Gai, Sun Jian led the pursuing force. Huang Zu came out of his city and drew up for battle in the open country. When Sun Jian had disposed his army, he rode out to the standard. Sun Ce, clad in armor, placed himself beside his father.Huang Zu rode out with two generals —-Zhang Hui from Jiangxia and Chen Sheng from Xiangyang.Flourishing his whip, Huang Zu abused his enemy, ""You swarm of rebels from the south! Why do you invade the land of a scion of the ruling house?""Zhang Hui challenged to combat, and Han Dang went out to accept. The two champions fought thirty bouts, and then Chen Sheng, seeing his fellow general becoming exhausted, rode to his aid. Sun Jian saw Chen Sheng coming, laid aside his spear, reached for his bow, and shot an arrow wounding Chen Sheng in the face. He fell from his horse. Panic seized upon Zhang Hui at the fall of his comrade, and he could no longer defend himself. Then Han Dang with a slash of his sword clove Zhang Hui's skull in twain.Both having fallen, Cheng Pu galloped up to make prisoner of Huang Zu, who threw off his helmet, slipped from his steed, and mingled for safety among his troops. Sun Jian led on the attack and drove the enemy to the Han River where he ordered Huang Gai to move the fleet upriver and moor there."
黃祖聚敗軍，來見劉表，備言堅勢不可當。表慌請蒯良商議。良曰：「目今新敗，兵無戰心；只可深溝高壘，以避其鋒；卻潛令人求救於袁紹，此圍自可解也。」蔡瑁曰：「子柔之言，直拙計也。兵臨城下，將至河邊，豈可束手待斃？某雖不才，願請軍出城，以決一戰。」劉表許之。,"Huang Zu led his defeated troops back and told Liu Biao, saying, ""Sun Jian was too strong for my army!""Kuai Liang was called in to advise, and he said, ""Our newly defeated soldiers have no heart for fighting now. Therefore we must fortify our position, while we seek help from Yuan Shao. Then we can extricate ourselves.""""A stupid move!"" said Cai Mao. ""The enemy is at the city gates: Shall we fold our hands and wait to be slain? Give me troops and I will go out and fight to the finish!"""
蔡瑁引軍萬餘，出襄陽城外，於峴山布陣。孫堅將得勝之兵，長驅大進。蔡瑁出馬。堅曰：「此人是劉表後妻之兄也，誰與吾擒之？」程普挺鐵脊矛出馬，與蔡瑁交戰。不到數合，蔡瑁敗走。堅驅大軍，殺得尸橫遍野。蔡瑁逃入襄陽。蒯良言瑁不聽良策，以致大敗，按軍法當斬。劉表以新娶其妹，不肯加刑。,"So Cai Mao was placed in command of ten thousand troops and went out to the Xian Hills where he drew up his battle line. Sun Jian led the invaders, now flushed with success.When Cai Mao approached, Sun Jian looked at him and said, ""He is brother-in-law to Liu Biao. Who will capture him?""Cheng Pu set his iron-spined lance and rode out. After a few bouts Cai Mao turned and fled. Sun Jian's army rode in and slaughtered till corpses filled the countryside, and Cai Mao rushed back and took refuge in Xiangyang.Kuai Liang said, ""Cai Mao ought to be put to death by military law! This defeat was due to his obstinacy.""But Liu Biao was unwilling to punish the brother of his newly wedded wife."
卻說孫堅分兵四面，圍住襄陽攻打。忽一日，狂風驟起，將中軍帥字旗竿吹折。韓當曰：「此非吉兆，可暫班師。」堅曰：「吾屢戰屢勝，取襄陽只在旦夕；豈可因風折旗竿，遽爾罷兵！」遂不聽韓當之言，攻城愈急。蒯良謂劉表曰：「某夜觀天象，見一將星欲墜。以分野度之，當應在孫堅。主公可速致書袁紹，求其相助。」,"Sun Jian surrounded Xiangyang and assailed the walls daily. One day a fierce gale sprang up, and the pole bearing his standard was broken.""Very inauspicious!"" said Han Dang. ""We ought to go back.""Sun Jian said, ""I have won every battle and the city is on the point of falling. Shall I return because the wind felled a flagstaff?""He flouted the advice and attacked the walls still more vigorously.Within the city the defenders had seen an omen.Kuai Liang told Liu Biao, ""Last night I saw that a great star fall into the sky corresponding to Sun Jian's territory. I calculated that it inferred the fall of Sun Jian.""Then Kuai Liang advised Liu Biao to seek help from Yuan Shao as quickly as possible."
劉表寫書，問誰敢突圍而出。健將呂公，應聲願往。蒯良曰：「汝既敢去，可聽吾計，與汝軍馬五百，多帶能射者衝出陣去，即奔峴山。他必引軍來趕，汝分一百人上山，尋石子準備；一百人執弓弩伏於林中。但有追兵到時，不可逕走；可盤旋曲折，引到埋伏之處，矢石俱發。若能取勝，放起連珠號砲，城中便出接應。如無追兵，不可放砲，趕程而去。今夜月不甚明，黃昏便可出城。」,"So Liu Biao wrote. Then he asked who would undertake to fight his way through the blockade with the letter. One Lu Gong, a warrior of great strength, offered himself for this service.Kuai Liang said, ""If you undertake this service, listen to my advice. You will have five hundred soldiers: Choose good bowmen. Dash through the enemy's formation and make for Xian Hills. You will be pursued; but send a hundred soldiers up the hill to prepare large stones, and place a hundred archers in ambush in the woods. These are not to flee from the pursuers but to beguile them along devious ways round to the place where the boulders have been prepared. There stones will be rolled down and arrows shot. If you succeed, fire off a series of bombs as a signal, and the armies in the city will come out to help. If you are not pursued, get away as fast as possible. Tonight will be suitable as there is very little moon. Start at dusk."""
呂公領了計策，拴束軍馬。黃昏時分，密開東門，引兵出城。孫堅在帳中，忽聞喊聲，急上馬引三十餘騎，出營來看。軍士報說：「有一彪人馬殺將出來，望峴山而去。」堅不會諸將，只引三十餘騎趕來。呂公已於山林叢雜去處，上下埋伏。堅馬快，單騎獨來，前軍不遠。堅大叫：「休走！」呂公勒回馬來戰孫堅。交馬只一合，呂公便走，閃入山路去。堅隨後趕入，卻不見呂公。堅方欲上山，忽然一聲鑼響，山上石子亂下，林中亂箭齊發。堅身中石箭，腦漿迸流，人馬皆死於峴山之內；壽止三十七歲。,"Lu Gong having received these directions, prepared his force to carry them out. As soon as day began to close in, he went quietly out at the east gate.Sun Jian was in his tent when he heard shouting, and a soldier came to report: ""There was a group of horsemen going out from the city!""Sun Jian at once mounted and rode out with thirty horsemen to discover the cause. Lu Gong's troops had already hidden themselves in the thick woods. Sun Jian rode ahead of his escort, and soon he found himself alone and close to the enemy. He called out to them to halt. Lu Gong at once turned back and came as if to fight. But they had only exchanged a single pass when Lu Gong again fled, taking the road among the hills. Sun Jian followed but soon lost sight of his foe.Sun Jian turned up the hill. Then the gongs clanged and down the hills fell showers of stones, while from among the trees the arrows flew in clouds. Sun Jian was hit by several arrows and a huge stone crushed in his head. Both he and his steed were killed. Sun Jian was only thirty-seven years old at his death."
呂公截住三十騎，並皆殺盡，於起連珠號砲。城中黃祖，蒯越，蔡瑁，分頭引兵殺出，江東諸軍大亂。黃蓋聽得喊聲震天，引水軍殺來，正迎著黃祖。戰不兩合，生擒黃祖。程普保著孫策，急待尋路，正遇呂公。程普縱馬向前，戰不到數合，一矛刺呂公於馬下。兩軍大戰，殺到天明，各自收軍。劉表軍自入城。孫策回到漢水，方知父親被亂箭射死，屍首已被劉表軍士扛抬入城去了，放聲大哭。眾軍俱號泣。策曰：「父屍在彼，安得回鄉！」黃蓋曰：「今活捉黃祖在此，得一人入城講和，將黃祖去換主公屍首。」,"His escort was overpowered and every man of them slain. Then Lu Gong let off a series of bombs, the sign of success, as agreed. At this signal Huang Zu, Kuai Yue, and Cai Mao led three armies out of the city and fell upon the South Land troops, throwing them into the utmost confusion.When Huang Gai heard the sound of battle, he led up the troops from the ships. He met Huang Zu and took Huang Zu prisoner after a brief fight.Cheng Pu set out to bear the sad news to Sun Ce. While he was seeking a way out, he came across Lu Gong. Cheng Pu at once put his horse at full speed and engaged Lu Gong. After a few bouts Lu Gong went down under a spear thrust. The battle became chaotic and continued till daylight broke, when each drew off his army. Liu Biao withdrew into the city.When Sun Ce returned to the river, he heard that his father had perished in the fight, and his body had been carried within the enemy's walls. He uttered a great cry, and the army joined him with wailing and tears.""How can I return home leaving my father's corpse with them?"" cried Sun Ce.Huang Gai said, ""We have Huang Zu as our prisoner. Let one enter the city and discuss peace, giving up our prisoner for our lord's body."""
言未畢，軍吏桓楷出曰：「某與劉表有舊，願入城為使。」策許之。桓楷入城見劉表，具說其事。表曰：「文臺屍首，吾已用棺木盛貯在此。可速放回黃祖，兩家各罷兵，再休侵犯。」桓楷拜謝欲行，階下蒯良出曰：「不可！不可！吾有一言，令江東諸軍片甲不回一一請先斬桓楷，然後用計。」正是：追敵孫堅方殞命，求和桓楷又遭殃。未知桓楷性命如何，且聽下文分解。,"He had barely finished speaking when an officer in the army, Huan Ji, offered himself as messenger, saying, ""I am an old friend of Liu Biao. I volunteer to take the mission.""Sun Ce agreed. So Huan Ji went and peace was discussed.Liu Biao told Huan Ji, saying, ""The body is already laid in a coffin and ready to be delivered as soon as Huang Zu returned. Let us both cease fighting and never again invade each other's territories.""Huan Ji thanked him and took his leave.But as Huan Ji went down the steps, Kuai Liang suddenly broke in, saying, ""No, no! Let me speak and I will see to it that not a single enemy can survive. I pray you first put this man to death and then to employ my means.""Pursuing his enemy, Sun Jian dies;On a peaceful mission, Huan Ji is threatened.The fate of the ambassador will be disclosed in a later chapter."
