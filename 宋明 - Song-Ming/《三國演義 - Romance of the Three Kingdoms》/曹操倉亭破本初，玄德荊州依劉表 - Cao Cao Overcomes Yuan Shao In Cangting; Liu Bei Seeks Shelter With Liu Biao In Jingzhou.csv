卻說曹操乘袁紹之敗，整頓軍馬，迤邐追襲。袁紹幅巾單衣，引八百餘騎，奔至黎陽北岸，大將蔣義渠出寨迎接。紹以前事訴與義渠，義渠乃招諭離散之眾。眾聞紹在，又皆蟻聚，軍勢復振，議還冀州。軍行之次，夜宿荒山。紹於帳中聞遠遠有哭聲，遂私往聽之。卻是敗軍相聚，訴說喪兄失弟，棄伴亡親之苦，各各搥胸大哭；皆曰：「若聽田豐之言，我等怎遭此禍！」紹大悔曰：「吾不聽田豐之言，兵敗將亡，今回去，有何面目見之耶！」,"Cao Cao lost no time in taking advantage of Yuan Shao's flight, but smote hard at the retreating army. Yuan Shao without helmet or proper dress, and with few followers, crossed hastily to the north bank at Liyang. He was met by one of his generals, Jiang Yiqu, who took him in and comforted him and listened to the tale of misfortunes. Next Jiang Yiqu called in the scattered remnants of the army, and when the soldiers heard that their old lord was alive they swarmed to him like ants, so that Yuan Shao quickly became strong enough to attempt the march to Jizhou. Soon the army set out and at night halted at Huang Hills.That evening, sitting in his tent, Yuan Shao seemed to hear a far off sound of lamentation. He crept out quietly to listen and found it was his own soldiers telling each other tales of woe. This one lamented an elder brother lost, that one grieved for his younger brother abandoned, a third mourned a companion missing, a fourth, a relative cut off. And each beat his breast and wept.And all said, ""Had he but listened to Tian Feng, we had not met this disaster!""Yuan Shao, very remorseful, said, ""I did not hearken unto Tian Feng, and now my soldiers have been beaten and I was nearly lost. How can I return and look him in the face?"""
次日，上馬正行間，逢紀引軍來接。紹對逢紀曰：「吾不聽田豐之言，致有此敗。吾今歸去，羞見此人。」逢紀因譖曰：「豐在獄中聞主公兵敗，撫掌大笑曰：『固不出吾之料！』」袁紹大怒曰：「豎儒怎敢笑我！我必殺之！」遂命使者齎寶劍先往冀州獄中殺田豐。,"Next day the march was resumed, and Yuan Shao met Peng Ji with reinforcements, to whom he said, ""I disregarded Tian Feng's advice and have brought myself to defeat. Now shall I be greatly ashamed to look him in the face.""This tribute to Tian Feng's prescience roused the jealousy of Peng Ji, who replied, ""Yes. When he heard the news of your defeat, though he was a prisoner, he clapped his hands for joy and said, 'Indeed, just as I foretold!'""""How dare he laugh at me, the blockhead? Assuredly he shall die!"" said Yuan Shao.Whereupon Yuan Shao wrote a letter and sent therewith a sword to slay the prisoner."
卻說田豐在獄中。一日，獄吏來見豐曰：「與別駕賀喜。」豐曰：「何喜可賀？」獄吏曰：「袁將軍大敗而回，君必見重矣。」豐笑曰：「吾今死矣！」獄吏問曰：「人皆為君喜，君何言死也？」豐曰：「袁將軍外寬而內忌，不念忠誠。若勝而喜，猶能赦我；今戰敗則羞，吾不望生矣。」,"Meanwhile Tian Feng's gaoler came to him one day, saying, ""Above all humans I felicitate you.""""What is the joyful occasion and why felicitate?"" said Tian Feng.The gaoler replied, ""Imperial Protector Yuan Shao has been defeated and is on his way back. He will treat you with redoubled respect.""""Now am I a dead man!"" said Tian Feng.""Why say you that, Sir, when all people give you joy?""""The Imperial Protector appears liberal, but he is jealous and forgetful of honest advice. Had he been victorious, he might have pardoned me. Now that he has been defeated and put to shame, I may not hope to live."""
獄吏未信。忽使者齎劍至，傳袁紹命，欲取田豐之首，獄吏方驚。豐曰：「吾固知必死也。」獄吏皆流淚。豐曰：「大丈夫生於天地間，不識其主而事之，是無智也！今日受死，夫何足惜！」乃自刎於獄中。後人有詩曰：,"But the gaoler did not believe Tian Feng. Before long came the letter and the sword with the fatal order.The gaoler was dismayed, but the victim said, ""I knew all too well that I should have to die.""The gaoler wept.Tian Feng said, ""An able person born into this world who does not recognize and serve the right lord is ignorant. Today I die, but I am not deserving of pity.""Whereupon he cut his throat in the prison."
昨朝沮授軍中死，今日田豐獄內亡。河北棟梁皆折斷，本初焉不喪家邦？,"Ju Shou but yesterday was killed,Tian Feng ends his life his fate fulfilled;The Yellow River's main beams break one by one,Mourn ye that Yuan House! Its day is done."
田豐既死，聞者皆為歎惜。袁紹回冀州，心煩意亂，不理政事。其妻劉氏勸立後嗣。紹所生三子，長子袁譚字顯忠，出守青州，次子袁熙字顯奕，出守幽州，三子袁尚字顯甫，是紹後妻劉氏所出，生得形貌俊偉，紹甚愛之，因此留在身邊。自官渡兵敗之後，劉氏勸立尚為後嗣。紹乃與審配、逢紀、辛評、郭圖四人商議。原來審、逢二人，向輔袁尚；辛、郭二人，向輔袁譚。四人各為其主。,"Thus died Tian Feng, pitied of all who heard of his fate.When Yuan Shao came home in Jizhou, he was with troubled mind and distorted thoughts. He could not attend to the business of government and became so ill that his second wife, who came of the Liu family and had replaced the first wife after her death, besought him to make his last dispositions.Now three sons had been born to Yuan Shao: Yuan Tan the eldest, who was the Commander of Qingzhou; Yuan Xi, who ruled over Youzhou; and Yuan Shang, borne to him by Lady Liu. This youngest son was very handsome and noble looking, and his father's favorite. So he was kept at home.After the defeat at Guandu, the lad's mother was constantly urging that her son should be named as successor, and Yuan Shao called together four of his counselors to consider this matter. These four happened to be divided in their sympathies: Shen Pei and Peng Ji being in favor of the youngest son, and Xin Ping and Guo Tu supporters of the eldest."
當下袁紹謂四人曰：「今外患未息，內事不可不早定，吾將議立後嗣。長子譚，為人性剛好殺；次子熙，為人柔懦難成；三子尚，有英雄之表，禮賢敬士，吾欲立之。公等之意若何？」郭圖曰：「三子之中，譚為長，今又居外；主公若廢長立幼，此亂萌也。目下軍威稍挫，敵兵壓境，豈可復使父子兄弟自相爭亂耶？主公且理會拒敵之策，立嗣之事，再容後議。」,"When they met to consult, Yuan Shao said, ""As there is nought but war and trouble outside our borders, it is necessary that tranquillity within be early provided for, and I wish to appoint my successor. My eldest son is hard and cruel, my second is mild and unfit. The third has the outward form of a hero, appreciates the wise, and is courteous to his subordinates. I wish him to succeed, but I wish that you tell me your opinions.""Guo Tu said, ""Yuan Tan is your first born, and he is in a position of authority beyond your control. If you pass over the eldest in favor of the youngest, you sow the seeds of turbulence. The prestige of the army has been somewhat lowered and enemies are on our border. Should you add to our weakness by making strife between father and son, elder and younger brothers? Rather consider how the enemy may be repulsed and turn to the question of the heirship later."""
袁紹躊躇未決。忽報袁熙引兵六萬，自幽州來，袁譚引兵五萬，自青州來，外甥高幹亦引兵五萬，自并州來，各至冀州助戰。紹喜，再整人馬，來戰曹操。時操引得勝之兵，陳列於河上，有土人簞食壺漿以迎之。操見父老數人，鬚髮盡白，乃命入帳中賜坐，問之曰：「老丈多少年紀？」答曰：「皆近百歲矣。」操曰：「吾軍士驚擾汝鄉，吾甚不安。」父老曰：「桓帝時，有黃星見於楚、宋之分，遼東人殷馗善觀天文，夜宿於此，對老漢等言：『黃星見於乾象，正照此間。後五十年，當有真人起於梁、沛之間。』今以年計之，整整五十年。袁本初重斂於民，民皆怨之。丞相興仁義之師，弔民伐罪，官渡一戰，破袁紹百萬之眾，正應當時殷馗之言，兆民可望太平矣。」操笑曰：「何敢當老丈所言？」遂取酒食絹帛賜老人而遣之。號令三軍：如有下鄉殺人家雞犬者，如殺人之罪。,"Then the natural hesitation of Yuan Shao asserted itself, and he could not make up his mind. Soon came news that his sons Yuan Tan was coming from Qingzhou with sixty thousand troops, Yuan Xi coming from Youzhou with fifty thousand troops, and his nephew Gao Gan coming from Bingzhou with fifty thousand troops to help him, and he turned his attention to preparations for fighting Cao Cao.When Cao Cao drew up his victorious army on the banks of Yellow River, the aged natives brought an offering of food and sauce to bid him welcome. Their venerable and hoary appearances led Cao Cao to treat them with the highest respect.He invited them to be seated and said to them, ""Venerable Sirs, what may be your age?""""We are nearly a hundred,"" replied the old villagers.""I should be very sorry if my army had disturbed your village,"" said Cao Cao.One of them said, ""In the days of the Emperor Huan a yellow star was seen over by way of the ancient states of Chu and Song in the southwest. Yin Kui of Liaodong, who was learned in astrology, happened to be passing the night here, and he told us that the star foretold the arrival in these parts, fifty years hence, of a true and honest man here in the Yellow River. Lo! That is exactly fifty years ago. Now Yuan Shao is very hard on the people and they hate him. You, Sir, having raised this army in the cause of humanity and righteousness, out of pity for the people and to punish crimes, and having destroyed the hordes of Yuan Shao at Guandu, just fulfill the prophecy of Yin Kui. The millions of the land may look now for tranquillity.""""How dare I presume that I am he?"" said Cao Cao with a smile.Wine was served and refreshments brought in, and the old gentlemen were sent away with presents of silk stuffs. And an order was issued to the army that if anyone killed so much as a fowl or a dog belonging to the villagers, he should be punished as for murder."
於是軍民震服。操亦心中暗喜人報袁紹聚四州之兵，得二三十萬，前至倉亭下寨。操提兵前進，下寨已定。次日，兩軍相對，各布成陣勢。操引諸將出陣，紹亦引三子一甥及文官武將出到陣前。操曰：「本初計窮力盡，何尚不思投降？直待刀臨項上，悔無及矣！」紹大怒，回顧眾將曰：「誰敢出馬？」袁尚欲於父前逞能，便舞雙刀，揮馬出陣，來往奔馳。操指問眾將曰：「此何人？」有識者答曰：「此袁紹三子袁尚也。」,"And the soldiers obeyed with fear and trembling while Cao Cao rejoiced in his heart.It was told Cao Cao that the total army from the four regions under the Yuan family amounted to two hundred thirty thousand soldiers and they were camped at Cangting. Cao Cao then advanced nearer to them and made a strong camp.Next day the two armies were arrayed over against each other. On one side Cao Cao rode to the front surrounded by his commanders, and on the other appeared Yuan Shao supported by his three sons, his nephew, and his leaders.Cao Cao spoke first, ""Yuan Shao, your schemes are poor, your strength is exhausted, why still refuse to think of surrender? Are you waiting till the sword shall be upon your neck? Then it will be too late.""Yuan Shao turned to those about him, saying, ""Who dares go out?""His son Yuan Shang was anxious to exhibit his prowess in the presence of his father, so he flourished his pair of swords and rode forth.Cao Cao pointed him out to his officers and asked, ""Anyone knows him?""""He is the youngest son of Yuan Shao,"" was the reply."
言未畢，一將挺槍早出。操視之，乃徐晃部將史渙也。兩騎相交，不三合，尚撥馬刺斜而走。史渙趕來，袁尚拈弓搭箭，翻身背射，正中史渙左目，墜馬而死。袁紹見子得勝，揮鞭一指，大隊人馬，擁將過來混戰。大殺一場，各鳴金收軍還寨。操與諸將商議破紹之策。程昱獻「十面埋伏」之計，勸操退軍於河上，伏兵十隊，誘紹追至河上；我軍無退路，必將死戰，可勝紹矣。,"Before they had finished speaking, from their own side rode out Shi Huan, armed with a spear. The two champions fought a little while and suddenly Yuan Shang whipped up his horse, made a feint and fled. His opponent followed. Yuan Shang took his bow, fitted an arrow, turned in his saddle, and shot at Shi Huan, wounding him in the left eye. Shi Huan fell from the saddle and died on the spot.Yuan Shao seeing his son thus get the better of his opponent, gave the signal for attack, and the whole army thundered forward. The onslaught was heavy, but presently the gongs on both sides sounded the retire and the battle ceased.When he had returned to camp, Cao Cao took counsel to find a plan to overcome Yuan Shao. Then Cheng Yu proposed the plan of the ""Ten Ambushes"" and persuaded Cao Cao to retire upon the river, placing troops in ambush as he went. Thus would Yuan Shao be inveigled into pursuit as far as the river, when Cao Cao's army would be forced to make a desperate stand or be driven into the water."
操然其計。左右各分五隊：左一隊夏侯惇、二隊張遼、三隊李典、四隊樂進、五隊夏侯淵；右一隊曹洪、二隊張郃、三隊徐晃、四隊于禁、五隊高覽。中軍許褚為先鋒。次日，十隊先進，埋伏左右已定。至半夜，操令許褚引兵前進，偽作劫寨之勢。袁紹五寨人馬，一齊俱起。許褚回軍便走。袁紹引軍趕來，喊聲不絕；比及天明，趕至河上，曹軍無去路。操大呼曰：「前無去路，諸軍何不死戰？」眾軍回身奮力向前。許褚飛馬當先，力斬十數將。袁軍大亂。袁紹退軍急回，背後曹軍趕來。,"Cao Cao accepted this suggestion and told off ten companies of five thousand soldiers each to lie in ten ambush on two sides of the road of retreat. The arrangement of the ambushes were thus: On the left, first company under Xiahou Dun; second company, Zhang Liao; third company, Li Dian; fourth company, Yue Jing; fifth company, Xiahou Yuan; on the right, first company was under Cao Hong; second company, Zhang He; third company, Xu Huang; fourth company, Yu Jin; fifth company, Gao Lan. Xu Chu commanded the advanced front.Next day the ten companies started first and placed themselves right and left as ordered. In the night Cao Cao ordered the advanced front to feign an attack on the camp, which roused all the enemy in all their camps. This done, Xu Chu retreated and Yuan Shao's army came in pursuit. The roar of battle went on without cessation, and at dawn Cao Cao's army rested on the river and could retreat no farther.Then Cao Cao shouted, ""There is no road in front, so all must fight or die.""The retreating army turned about and advanced vigorously. Xu Chu simply flew to the front, smote and killed ten generals and threw Yuan Shao's army into confusion. They tried to turn and march back, but Cao Cao was close behind."
正行間，一聲鼓響，左邊夏侯淵、右邊高覽，兩軍衝出。袁紹聚三子一甥，死衝血路奔走。又行不到十里，左邊樂進、右邊于禁殺出，殺得袁軍屍橫遍野，血流成渠。又行不到數里，左邊李典、右邊徐晃，兩軍截殺一陣。袁紹父子膽喪心驚，奔入舊寨，令三軍造飯。方欲待食，左邊張遼、右邊張郃，逕來衝寨。紹慌上馬，前奔倉亭；人馬困乏，欲待歇息，後面曹操大軍趕來，袁紹捨命而走。,"Then the drums of the enemy were heard, and right and left there appeared two ambush companies of Gao Lan and Xiahou Yuan. Yuan Shao collected about him his three sons and his nephew, and they were enabled to cut an alley out and flee. Three miles further on they fell into another ambush of Yue Jing and Yu Jin, and here many troops of Yuan Shao were lost so that their corpses lay over the countryside and the blood filled the water courses. Another three miles and they met the third pair of Li Dian and Xu Huang barring their road.Here they lost heart and bolted for an old camp of their own that was near, and bade their men prepare a meal. But just as the food was ready to eat, down came Zhang Liao and Zhang He and burst into the camp.Yuan Shao mounted and fled as far as Cangting, when he was tired and his steed spent. But there was no rest, for Cao Cao came in close pursuit. It seemed now a race for life."
正行之間，左邊曹洪、右邊夏侯惇，擋住去路。紹大呼曰：「若不決死戰，必為所擒矣！」奮力衝突，得脫重圍。袁熙、高幹皆被箭傷。軍馬死亡殆盡。紹抱三子痛哭一場，不覺昏倒。眾人急救，紹口吐鮮血不止，歎曰：「吾自歷戰數十場，不意今日狼狽至此！此天喪吾也！汝等各回本州，誓與曹賊一決雌雄！」便教辛評、郭圖火急隨袁譚前往青州整頓，恐曹操犯境；令袁熙仍回幽州，高幹仍回并州，各去收拾人馬，以備調用。袁紹引袁尚等入冀州養病，令尚與審配、逢紀暫掌軍事。,"But presently Yuan Shao found his onward course again blocked by Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong, and he groaned aloud.""If we do not make most desperate efforts, we are all captives!"" said he.And they plunged forward. His second son Yuan Xi and his nephew Gao Gan were wounded by arrows, and most of his soldiers were dead or had disappeared. He gathered his sons into his arms and wept bitterly. Then he fell into a swoon. He was picked up, but his mouth was full of blood which ran forth in a bright scarlet stream.He sighed, saying, ""Many battles have I fought, and little did I think to be driven to this. Heaven is afflicting me. You had better return each to his own territory and swear to fight this Cao Cao to the end.""Then Yuan Shao bade Xin Ping and Guo Tu as quickly as possible follow Yuan Tan to Qingzhou and prepare to give battle to Cao Cao lest he should invade. Yuan Xi was told to go to Youzhou and Gao Gan to Bingzhou.So each started to prepare armies and horses for repulsing Cao Cao. Yuan Shao with his youngest son Yuan Shang and the remnant of his officers went away to Jizhou, and military operations were suspended for a time."
卻說曹操自倉亭大勝，重賞三軍，令人探察冀州虛實。細作回報：「紹臥病在。袁尚、審配緊守城池。袁譚、袁熙、高幹皆回本州。」眾皆勸操急攻之。操曰：「冀州糧食極廣，審配又有機謀，未可急拔。見今禾稼在田，恐廢民業，姑待秋成後取之未晚。」正議間，忽荀彧有書到，報說：「劉備在汝南得劉辟、龔都數萬之眾。聞丞相提軍出征河北，乃令劉辟守汝南，備親自引兵乘虛來攻許昌。丞相可速回軍禦之。」操大驚，留曹洪屯兵河上，虛張聲勢。操自提大兵往汝南來迎劉備。,"Meanwhile Cao Cao was distributing rewards to his army for the late victory, and his spies were scouting all about Jizhou. He soon learned that Yuan Shao was ill, and that the youngest son Yuan Shang and Shen Pei were in command of the city, while his brothers and cousin had returned each to his own. Cao Cao's advisers were in favor of a speedy attack.But he objected, saying, ""Jizhou is large and well supplied. Shen Pei is an able strategist. And it behooves me to be careful. I would rather wait till the autumn when the crops have been gathered in so that the people will not suffer.""While the attack was being talked over there came letters from Xun Yu:""Liu Bei was strengthening himself at Runan with the force of Liu Pi and Gong Du and, when he heard that you was attacking Jizhou, he said he would take the opportunity to march on the capital. Wherefore you, Sir, should hasten homeward to defend Xuchang.""This news disconcerted Cao Cao. He left Cao Hong in command on the river bank, with orders to maintain the appearance of strength there, while he led the main part of his army to meet the threatened attack from Runan."
卻說玄德與關、張、趙雲等，引兵欲襲許都。行近穰山地面，正遇曹兵殺來，玄德便於穰山下寨。軍分三隊：雲長屯兵於東南角上，張飛屯兵於西南角上，玄德與趙雲於正南立寨。曹操兵至，玄德鼓譟而出。操布成陣勢，叫玄德打話。玄德出馬於門旗下。操以鞭指罵曰：「吾待汝為上賓，汝何背義忘恩？」玄德曰：「汝託名漢相，實為國賊！吾乃漢室宗親，奉天子密詔，來討反賊！」遂於馬上朗誦衣帶詔。,"Meanwhile Liu Bei, his brothers, and the leaders, having gone forth with the intention of attacking the capital, had reached a point near the Rang Mountains when Cao Cao came upon them. So Liu Bei camped by the hills and divided his army into three, sending Guan Yu and Zhang Fei with ten thousand troops each to entrench themselves southeast and southwest respectively of the main body, which he and Zhao Zilong commanded.When Cao Cao came near, Liu Bei beat his drums and went out to where Cao Cao had already arrayed his army.Cao Cao called Liu Bei to a parley, and when the latter appeared under his great standard, Cao Cao pointed his whip at him and railed, saying, ""I treated you as a guest of the highest consideration. Why then do you turn your back on righteousness and forget kindness?""Liu Bei replied, ""Under the name of Prime Minister you are really a rebel. I am a direct descendant of the family, and I have a secret decree from the Throne to take such offenders as you.""As he said these words, he produced and recited the decree which is known as the ""Girdle Mandate."""
操大怒，教許褚出戰。玄德背後趙雲，挺槍出馬。二將相交，三十合不分勝負。忽然喊聲大震，東南角上，雲長衝突而來；西南角上，張飛引軍衝突而來。三處一齊掩殺。曹軍遠來疲困，不能抵當，大敗而走。玄德得勝回營。,"Cao Cao grew very angry and ordered Xu Chu to go out to battle. As Liu Bei's champion, out rode Zhao Zilong with spear ready to thrust. The two warriors exchanged thirty bouts without advantage to either. Then there arose an earth-rending shout and up came the two brothers, Guan Yu from the southeast and Zhang Fei from the southwest. The three armies then began a great attack, which proved too much for Cao Cao's troops, fatigued by a long march, and they were worsted and fled. Liu Bei having scored this victory returned to camp."
次日，又使趙雲搦戰。操兵旬日不出。玄德再使張飛搦戰，操兵亦不出。玄德愈疑。忽報龔都運糧至，被曹軍圍住，玄德急令張飛去救。忽又報夏侯惇引軍抄背後逕取汝南，玄德大驚曰：「若如此，吾前後受敵，無所歸矣！」急遣雲長救之。兩軍皆去。,"Next day he sent out Zhao Zilong again to challenge the enemy, but it was not accepted and Cao Cao's army remained ten days without movement. Then Zhang Fei offered a challenge which also was not accepted. And Liu Bei began to feel anxious.Then unexpectedly came news that the enemy had stopped a train of supplies brought by Gong Du, and at once Zhang Fei went to the rescue. Worse still was the news that followed, that an army led by Xiahou Dun had got in behind to attack Runan.Quite dismayed, Liu Bei said, ""If this be true, I have enemies in front and rear and have no place to go.""He then sent Guan Yu to try to recover the city and thus both his brothers were absent from his side."
不一日，飛馬來報夏侯惇已打破汝南，劉辟棄城而走，雲長現今被圍。玄德大驚。又報張飛去救龔都，也被圍住了。玄德急欲回兵，又恐操兵後襲。忽報寨外許褚搦戰，玄德不敢出馬。候至天明，教軍士飽餐，步軍先起，馬軍後隨，寨中虛傳更點。玄德等離寨約行數里，轉過土山，火把齊明，山頭上大呼曰：「休教走了劉備！丞相在此專等！」玄德慌尋路走。趙雲曰：「主公勿憂，但跟某來。」趙雲挺槍躍馬，殺開條路，玄德掣雙股劍後隨。,"One day later a horseman rode up to say that Runan had fallen, its defender Liu Pi had fled, and Guan Yu was surrounded. To make the matters worse, the news came that Zhang Fei, who had gone to rescue Gong Du, was in like case. Liu Bei tried to withdraw his troops, fearing all the time an attack from Cao Cao. Suddenly the sentinels came in, saying: ""Xu Chu is at the camp gate offering a challenge.""Liu Bei did not allow his army to go out. They waited till dawn, and then Liu Bei bade the soldiers get a good meal and be ready to start. When ready the foot went out first, the horsemen next, leaving a few troops in the camp to beat the watches and maintain an appearance of occupation.After traveling some miles, they passed some mounds. Suddenly torches blazed out, and on the summit stood one who shouted, ""Do not let Liu Bei run away! I, the Prime Minister, am here awaiting you!""Liu Bei dashed along the first clear road he saw.Zhao Zilong said, ""Fear not, my lord, only follow me!""And setting his spear, Zhao Zilong galloped in front opening an alley as he went. Liu Bei gripped his double swords and followed close."
正戰間，許褚追至，與趙雲力戰。背後于禁、李典又到。玄德見勢危，落荒而走。聽得背後喊聲漸遠，玄德望深山僻路，單馬逃生。捱到天明，側首一彪軍衝出。玄德大驚，視之，乃劉辟引敗軍千餘騎，護送玄德家小前來；孫乾、簡雍、糜芳亦至，訴說：「夏侯惇軍勢甚銳，因此棄城而走。曹兵趕來，幸得雲長當住，因此得脫。玄德曰：「不知雲長今在何處？」劉辟曰：「將軍且行，卻再理會。」,"As they were winning through, Xu Chu came in pursuit and engaged Zhao Zilong, and two other companies led by Yu Jin and Li Dian bore down as well. Seeing the situation so desperate, Liu Bei plunged into the wilds and fled. Gradually the sounds of battle became fainter and died away while he went deeper and deeper into the hills, a single horseman fleeing for his life. He kept on his way till daybreak, when a company suddenly appeared beside the road. Liu Bei saw these men with terror at first, but was presently relieved to find they were led by the friendly Liu Pi. They were a company of his defeated army escorting the family of their chief. With them also were Sun Qian, Jian Yong, and Mi Fang.They told him, ""The attack on Runan was too strong to be resisted, and so we were compelled to abandon the defense, and the enemy followed, and only Guan Yu's timely arrival saved us from destruction.""""I do not know where my brother is,"" said Liu Bei.""All will come right if you will push on,"" said Liu Pi."
行到數里，一棒鼓響，前面擁出一彪人馬。當先大將，乃是張郃，大叫：「劉備快下馬受降！」玄德方欲退後，只見山頭上紅旗麾動，一軍從山塢內擁出，為首大將，乃高覽也。玄德兩頭無路，仰天大呼曰：「天何使我受此窘極耶！事勢至此，不如就死！」欲拔劍自刎。劉辟急止之曰：「容某死戰，奪路救君。」言訖，便來與高覽交鋒。戰不三合，被高覽一刀砍於馬下。,"They pushed on. Before they had gone far, the beating of drums was heard and suddenly appeared Zhang He with a thousand soldiers.Zhang He cried, ""Liu Bei, quickly dismount and surrender!""Liu Bei was about to retire when he saw a red flag waving from a rampart on the hills and down came rushing another body of troops under Gao Lan.Thus checked in front and his retreat cut off, Liu Bei looked up to Heaven and cried, ""O Heaven, why am I brought to this state of misery? Nothing is left me now but death!""And he drew his sword to slay himself.But Liu Pi stayed his hand, saying, ""Let me try to fight a way out and save you. Death is nothing to me!""As he spoke Gao Lan's force was on the point of engaging his. The two leaders met and in the third bout Liu Pi was cut down."
玄德正慌，方欲自戰，高覽後軍忽然自亂，一將衝陣而來，槍起處，高覽翻身落馬。視之，乃趙雲也。玄德大喜。雲縱馬挺槍，殺散後隊，又來前軍獨戰張郃。郃與雲戰三十餘合，撥馬敗走。雲乘勢衝殺，卻被郃兵守住山隘，路窄不得出。,"Liu Bei at once rushed up to fight, but just then there was sudden confusion in the rear ranks of the opponents, and a warrior dashed up and thrust at Gao Lan with his spear. Gao Lan fell from his steed. The newcomer was Zhao Zilong.His arrival was most opportune. He urged forward his steed thrusting right and left, and the enemy's ranks broke and scattered. Then the first force under Zhang He came into the fight, and the leader and Zhao Zilong fought thirty or more bouts. However, this proved enough, for Zhang He turned his horse away recognizing that he was worsted. Zhao Zilong vigorously attacked, but was forced into a narrow space in the hills where he was hemmed in."
正奪路間，只見雲長、關平、周倉引三百軍到。兩下夾攻，殺退張郃。各出隘口，占住山險下寨。玄德使雲長尋覓張飛。原來張飛去救龔都，龔都已被夏侯淵所殺。飛奮力殺退夏侯淵，迤邐趕去，卻被樂進引軍圍住。雲長路逢敗軍，尋蹤而去，殺退樂進，與飛同回見玄德。,"While seeking for some outlet, they saw Guan Yu, Guan Ping, and Zhou Cang, with three hundred men, coming along. Soon Zhang He was driven off, and then Liu Bei's troops came out of the narrow defile and occupied a strong position among the hills where they made a camp.Liu Bei sent Guan Yu for news of the missing brother. Zhang Fei had been attacked by Xiahou Yuan who had killed Gong Du, but Zhang Fei had vigorously resisted, beaten him off, and followed him up. Then Yue Jing had come along and surrounded Zhang Fei.In this pass he was found by Guan Yu, who had heard of his plight from some of his scattered soldiers met on the way. Now they drove off the enemy. The two brothers returned."
人報曹軍大隊趕來，玄德教孫乾等保護老小先行。玄德與關、張、趙雲在後，且戰且走。操見玄德去遠，收軍不趕。玄德敗軍不滿一千，狼狽而奔。前至一江，喚土人問之，乃漢江也。玄德權且安營。土人知玄德，奉獻羊酒，乃聚飲於沙灘之上。玄德歎曰諸：「諸君皆有王佐之才，不幸跟隨劉備。備之命窘，累及諸君。今日身無立錐，誠恐有誤諸君。君等何不棄備而投明主，以取功名乎？」,"Soon they heard of the approach of a large body of Cao Cao's army. Liu Bei then bade Sun Qian guard his family and sent him on ahead, while he and the others kept off the enemy, sometimes giving battle and anon marching. Seeing that Liu Bei had retired too far, Cao Cao let him go and left the pursuit.When Liu Bei collected his army, he found they numbered only a thousand, and this halting and broken force marched as fast as possible to the west. Coming to a river they asked the natives its name and were told it was the Han River, and near it Liu Bei made a temporary camp. When the local people found out who was in the camp, they presented meat and wine.A feast was given upon a sandy bank of the Han River.After they had drunk awhile, Liu Bei addressed his faithful followers, saying, ""All you, Fair Sirs, have talents fitting you to be advisers to a monarch, but your destiny has led you to follow poor me. My fate is distressful and full of misery. Today I have not a spot to call my own, and I am indeed leading you astray. Therefore I say you should abandon me and go to some illustrious lord where you may be able to become famous."""
眾皆掩面而哭。雲長曰：「兄言差矣。昔日高祖與項羽爭天下，數敗於羽，後九里山一戰成功，而開四百年基業。勝負兵家之常，何可自隳其志？」孫乾曰：「成敗有時，不必傷心。此離荊州不遠。劉景升坐鎮九州，兵強糧足，更且與公皆漢室宗親，何不往投之？」玄德曰：「但恐不容耳。」乾曰：「某願先往說之，使景升出境而迎主公。」,"At these words they all covered their faces and wept.Guan Yu said, ""Brother, you are wrong to speak thus. When the great Founder of Han contended with Xiang Yu, he was defeated many times, but he won at the Nine-Mile Mountains and that achievement was the foundation of a dynasty that endured for four centuries. Victory and defeat are but ordinary events in a soldier's career, and why should you give up?""""Success and failure both have their seasons,"" said Sun Qian, ""and we are not to grieve. Jingzhou, which your illustrious relative, Liu Biao, commands, is a rich and prosperous country. Liu Biao is of your house, why not go to him?""""Only that I fear he may not receive me,"" said Liu Bei.""Then let me go and prepare the way. I will make Liu Biao come out to his borders to welcome you."""
玄德大喜，便令孫乾星夜往荊州。到郡入見劉表。禮畢，劉表問曰：「公從玄德，何故至此？」乾曰：「劉使君天下英雄，雖兵微將寡，而志欲匡扶社稷。汝南劉辟、龔都素無親故，亦以死報之。明公與使君，同為漢室之冑；今使君新敗，欲往江東投孫仲謀。乾諫言曰：『不可背親而向書疏。荊州劉將軍禮賢下士，士歸之如水之投東，何況同宗乎？』因此使君特使乾先來拜白，惟明公命之。」,"So with his lord's approval, Sun Qian set off immediately and hastened to Jingzhou. When the ceremonies of greeting were over, Liu Biao asked the reason of the visit.Said Sun Qian, ""The princely Liu Bei is one of the heroes of the day, although just at the moment he may lack soldiers and leaders. His mind is set upon restoring the dynasty to its pristine glory, and at Runan the two commanders, Liu Pi and Gong Du, though bound to him by no ties, were content to die for the sake of his ideals. You, Illustrious Sir, like Liu Bei, are a scion of the imperial stock. Now the Princely One has recently suffered defeat and thinks of seeking a home in the east with Sun Quan. I have ventured to dissuade him, saying that he should not turn from a relative and go to a mere acquaintance; telling him that you, Sir, are well known as courteous to the wise and condescending to scholars, so that they flock to you as the waters flow to the east sea, and that certainly you would show kindness to one of the same ancestry. Wherefore he has sent me to explain matters and request your commands."""
表大喜曰：「玄德，吾弟也。久欲相會，而不可得。今肯惠顧，實為幸甚。」蔡瑁譖曰：「不可。劉備先從呂布，後事曹操，近投袁紹，皆不克終，足可見其為人。今若納之，曹操必加兵於我，枉動干戈；不如斬孫乾之首，以獻曹操，操必重待主公也。」孫乾正色曰：「乾非懼死之人也。劉使君忠心為國，非曹操、袁紹、呂布等比。前此相從，不得已也。今聞劉將軍漢朝苗裔，誼切同宗，故千里相投。爾何獻讒而妒賢如此耶！」,"""He is my brother,"" said Liu Biao, ""and I have long desired to see him, but no opportunity has occurred. I should be very happy if he would come.""Cai Mao, who was sitting by, here broke in, ""No, no! Liu Bei first followed Lu Bu, then he served Cao Cao, and next he joined himself to Yuan Shao. And he stayed with none of these, so that you can see what manner of man he is. If he comes here, Cao Cao will assuredly come against us and fight. Better cut off this messenger's head and send it as an offering to Cao Cao, who would reward you well for the service.""Sun Qian sat unmoved while this harangue was pronounced, saying at the end, ""I am not afraid of death. Liu Bei, the Princely One, is true and loyal to the state and so out of sympathy with Lu Bu, or Cao Cao, or Yuan Shao. It is true he followed these three, but there was no help for it. Now he knows your chief is a member of the family, so that both are of the same ancestry, and that is why he has come far to join him. How can you slander a good man like that?"""
劉表聞言，乃叱蔡瑁曰：「吾主意已定，汝勿多言。」蔡瑁慚恨而出。劉表遂命孫乾先往報玄德，一面親自出郭三十里迎接。玄德見表，執禮甚恭。表亦相待甚厚。玄德引關、張等拜見劉表，表遂與玄德同入荊州，分撥院宅居住。,"Liu Biao bade Cai Mao be silent and said, ""I have decided, and you need say no more.""Whereat Cai Mao sulkily left the audience chamber.Then Sun Qian was told to return with the news that Liu Bei would be welcome, and Imperial Protector Liu Biao went ten miles beyond the city to meet his guest.When Liu Bei arrived, he behaved to his host with the utmost politeness and was warmly welcomed in return. Then Liu Bei introduced his two sworn brothers and friends and they entered Jingzhou City where Liu Bei finally was lodged in the Imperial Protector's own residence."
卻說曹操探知玄德已往荊州，投奔劉表，便欲引兵攻之。程昱曰：「袁紹未除，而遽攻荊、襄，倘袁紹從北而起，勝負未可知矣。不如還兵許都，養軍蓄銳，待來年春煖，然後引兵先破袁紹，後取荊、襄。南北之利，一舉可收也。」,"As soon as Cao Cao knew whither his enemy had gone, he wished to attack Liu Biao, but Cheng Yu advised against any attempt so long as Yuan Shao, the dangerous enemy, was left with power to inflict damage.He said, ""My lord should return to the capital to refresh the soldiers so that they may be ready for a north and south campaign in the mild spring weather."""
操然其言，遂提兵回許都。至建安八年，春正月，操復商議興兵。先差夏侯惇、滿寵鎮守汝南，以拒劉表；留曹仁、荀彧守許都；親統大軍前赴官渡屯紮。,"Cao Cao accepted his advice and set out for the capital. In the first month of the eighth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 203), Cao Cao once again began to think of war, and sent to garrison Runan as a precaution against Liu Biao. Then, after arranging for the safety of the capital, he marched a large army to Guandu, the camp of the year before, and aimed at Jizhou."
且說袁紹自舊歲感冒吐血症候，今方稍愈，商議欲攻許都。審配諫曰：「舊歲官渡、倉亭之敗，軍心未振，尚當深溝高壘，以養軍民之力。」,"As to Yuan Shao, who had been suffering from blood-spitting but was now in better health, he began to think of measures against Xuchang, but Shen Pei dissuaded him, saying, ""You are not yet recovered from the fatigues of last year. It would be better to make your position impregnable and set to improving the army."""
正議間，忽報曹操進兵官渡，來攻冀州。紹曰：「若候兵臨城下，將至河邊，然後拒敵，事已遲矣。吾當自領大軍出迎。」袁尚曰：「父親病體未痊，不可遠征。兒願提兵前去迎敵。」紹許之，遂使人往青州取袁譚，幽州取袁熙，并州取高幹，四路同破曹操。正是：纔向汝南鳴戰鼓，又從冀北動征鼙。未知勝負如何，且看下文分解。,"When the news of Cao Cao's approach arrived, Yuan Shao said, ""If we allow the foe to get close to the city before we march to the river, we shall have missed our opportunity. I must go out to repel this army.""Here his son Yuan Shang interposed, ""Father, you are not sufficiently recovered for a campaign and should not go so far. Let me lead the army against this enemy.""Yuan Shao consented, and he sent to Qingzhou and Youzhou and Bingzhou to call upon his other two sons and his nephew to attack Cao Cao at the same time as his own army.Against Runan they beat the drum,And from Jizhou the armies come.To whom the victory will be seen in the next chapter."
