卻說魯肅、孔明辭了玄德、劉琦，登舟望柴桑郡來。二人在舟中共議，魯肅謂孔明曰：「先生見孫將軍，切不可實言曹操兵多將廣。」孔明曰：「不須子敬叮嚀，亮自有對答之語。」及船到岸，肅請孔明於館驛中暫歇，先自往見孫權。權正聚文武於堂上議事，聞魯肅回，急召入問曰：「子敬往江夏，體探虛實若何？」肅曰：「已知其略，尚容徐稟。」權將曹操檄文示肅曰：「操昨遣使齎文至此，孤先發遣來使，現今會眾商議未定。」肅接檄文觀看。其略曰：,"In the boat on the way to Chaisang, the two travelers beguiled the time by discussing affairs.Lu Su impressed upon his companion, saying, ""When you see my master, do not reveal the truth about the magnitude of Cao Cao's army.""""You do not have to remind me,"" replied Zhuge Liang, ""but I shall know how to reply.""When the boat arrived, Zhuge Liang was lodged in the guests' quarters, and Lu Su went alone to see his master. Lu Su found Sun Quan actually at a council, assembled to consider the situation. Lu Su was summoned thereto and questioned at once upon what he had discovered.""I know the general outline, but I want a little time to prepare my report,"" replied Lu Su.Then Sun Quan produced Cao Cao's letter and gave it to Lu Su.""That came yesterday. I have sent the bearer of it back, and this gathering is to consider the reply,"" said he.Lu Su read the letter:"
孤近承帝命，奉詔伐罪。旄麾南指，劉琮束手；荊襄之民，望風歸順。今統雄兵百萬，上將千員，欲與將軍會獵於江夏，共伐劉備，同分土地，永結盟好。幸勿觀望，速賜回音。,"""When I, the Prime Minister, received the imperial command to punish a fault, my banners went south and Liu Zong became my prisoner, while the people of Jingzhou flocked to my side at the first rumor of my coming. Under my hand are one million strong and a thousand able leaders. My desire is, General, that we go on a great hunting expedition into Jiangxia and together attack Liu Bei. We will share his land between us, and we will swear perpetual amity. If happily you would not be a mere looker-on, I pray you reply quickly."""
魯肅看畢曰：「主公尊意若何？」權曰：「未有定論。」張昭曰：「曹操擁百萬之眾，借天子之名，以征四方，拒之不順。且主公大勢可以拒操者，長江也。今操既得荊州，長江之險，已與我共之矣，勢不可敵。以愚之計，不如納降為萬安之策。」眾謀士皆曰：「子布之言，正合天意。」孫權沈吟不語。張昭又曰：「主公不必多疑。如降操則東吳民安，江南六郡可保矣。」孫權低頭不語。,"""What have you decided upon, my lord?"" asked Lu Su as he finished the letter.""I have not yet decided.""Then Zhang Zhao said, ""It would be imprudent to withstand Cao Cao's hundred legions backed by the imperial authority. Moreover, your most important defense against him is the Great River; and since Cao Cao has gained possession of Jingzhou, the river is his ally against us. We cannot withstand him, and the only way to tranquillity, in my opinion, is submission.""""The words of the speaker accord with the manifest decree of providence,"" echoed all the assembly.Sun Quan remaining silent and thoughtful."
須臾，權起更衣，魯肅隨於權後。權知肅意，乃執肅手而言曰：「卿欲如何？」肅曰：「恰纔眾人所言，深誤將軍。眾人皆可降曹操，惟將軍不可降曹操。」權曰：「何以言之？」肅曰：「如肅等降操，當以肅還鄉黨累官，故不失州郡也；將軍降操，欲安所歸乎？位不過封侯，車不過一乘，騎不過一匹，從不過數人，豈得南面稱孤哉？眾人之意，各自為己，不可聽也。將軍宜早定大計。」,"Zhang Zhao again took up the argument, saying, ""Do not hesitate, my lord. Submission to Cao Cao means tranquillity to the people of the South Land and safety for the inhabitants of the six territories.""Sun Quan still remained silent. His head bent in deep thought. Presently he arose and paced slowly out at the door, and Lu Su followed him. Outside he took Lu Su by the hand, saying, ""What do you desire?""""What they have all been saying is very derogatory to you. A common person might submit. You cannot.""""Why? How do you explain that?""""If people like us servants submitted, we would just return to our village or continue holding our offices, and everything would go on as before. If you submit, whither will you go? You will be created a lord of some humble fief, perhaps. You will have one carriage, no more; one saddle horse, that is all. Your retinue will be some ten. Will you be able to sit facing the south and call yourself by the kingly title of 'The Solitary'? Each one in that crowd of hangers-on is thinking for himself, is purely selfish, and you should not listen to them, but take a line of your own and that quickly. Determine to play a bold game!"""
權歎曰：「諸人議論，大失孤望。子敬開說大計，正與吾見相同。此天以子敬賜我也！但操新得袁紹之眾，近又得荊州之兵，恐勢大難以抵敵。」肅曰：「肅至江夏，引諸葛瑾之弟諸葛亮在此，主公可問之，便知虛實。」權曰：「臥龍先生在此乎？」肅曰：「現在館驛中安歇。」權曰：「今日天晚，且未相見。來日聚文武於帳下，先教見我江東英俊，然後升堂議事。」,"Sun Quan sighed, ""They all talk and talk: They miss my point of view. Now you have just spoken of a bold game, and your view is the same as mine. Surely God has expressly sent you to me. Still Cao Cao is now the stronger by all Yuan Shao's and Liu Biao's armies, and he has possession of Jingzhou. I fear he is almost too powerful to contend with.""""I have brought back with me Zhuge Liang, the younger brother of our Zhuge Jin. If you questioned him, he would explain clearly.""""Is Master Sleeping Dragon really here?""""Really here, in the guest-house.""""It is too late to see him today. But tomorrow I will assemble my officials, and you will introduce him to all my best. After that we will debate the matter."""
肅領命而去；次日至館驛中見孔明，又囑曰：「今見我主，切不可言曹操兵多。」孔明笑曰：「亮自見機而變，決不有誤。」肅乃引孔明至幕下。早見張昭、顧雍等一班文武，二十餘人，峨冠博帶，整衣端坐。孔明逐一相見，各問姓名。施禮已畢，坐於客位。張昭等見孔明丰神飄洒，器宇軒昂，料道此人必來游說。張昭先以言挑之曰：「昭乃江東微末之士，久聞先生高臥隆中，自比管、樂。此語果有之乎？」孔明曰：「此亮平生小可之比也。」昭曰：「近聞劉豫州三顧先生於草廬之中，幸得先生，以為如魚得水，思欲席捲荊、襄。今一旦以屬曹操，未審是何主見？」,"With these instructions Lu Su retired.Next day he went to the guest-house and conveyed Sun Quan's commands to the guest, particularly saying, ""When you see my master, say nothing of the magnitude of Cao Cao's army.""Zhuge Liang smiled, saying, ""I shall act as circumstances dictate. You may be sure I shall make no mistakes.""Zhuge Liang was then conducted to where the high officers, civil and military to the number of forty and more, were assembled. They formed a dignified conclave as they sat in stately ranks with their tall headdresses and broad girdles.Zhang Zhao sat at the head, and Zhuge Liang first saluted him. Then, one by one, he exchange the formal courtesies with them all. This done he took his seat in the guest's chair.They, on their part, noted with interest Zhuge Liang's refined and elegant manner and his commanding figure, thinking within themselves, ""Here is a persuader fitted for discourse.""Zhang Zhao led the way in trying to bait the visitor. He said, ""You will pardon the most insignificant of our official circle, myself, if I mention that people say you compare yourself with those two famous men of talent, Guan Zhong and Yue Yi. Is there any truth in this?""""To a trifling extent I have compared myself with them,"" replied Zhuge Liang.""I have heard that Liu Bei made three journeys to visit you when you lived in retirement in your simple dwelling in the Sleeping Dragon Ridge, and that when you consented to serve him, he said he was as lucky as a fish in getting home to the ocean. Then he desired to possess the region about Jingzhou. Yet today all that country belongs to Cao Cao. I should like to hear your account of all that."""
孔明自思張昭乃孫權手下第一個謀士，若不先難倒他，如何說得孫權；遂答曰：「吾觀取漢上之地，易如反掌。我主劉豫州躬行仁義，不忍奪同宗之基業，故力辭之。劉琮孺子，聽信佞言，暗自投降，致使曹操得以猖獗。今我主屯兵江夏，別有良圖，非等閒可知也。」,"Zhuge Liang thought, ""This Zhang Zhao is Sun Quan's first adviser. Unless I can nonplus him, I shall never have a chance with his master.""So he replied, ""In my opinion the taking of the region around the Han River was as simple as turning over one's hand. But my master Liu Bei is both righteous and humane and would not stoop to filching the possession of a member of his own house. So he refused the offer of succession. But Liu Zong, a stupid lad, misled by specious words, submitted to Cao Cao and fell victim to his ferocity. My master is in camp at Jiangxia, but what his future plans may be cannot be divulged at present."""
昭曰：「若此，是先生言行相違也。先生自比管、樂。管仲相桓公，霸諸侯，一匡天下；樂毅扶持微弱之燕，下齊七十餘城；此二人者，真濟世之才也。先生在草廬之中，但笑傲風月，抱膝危坐；今既從事劉豫州，當為生靈興利除害，剿滅亂賊。且劉豫州未得先生之時，尚且縱橫寰宇，割據城池；今得先生，人皆仰望；雖三尺童蒙，亦謂彪虎生翼，將見漢室復興，曹氏即滅矣；朝廷舊臣，山林隱士，無不拭目而待：以為拂高天之雲翳，仰日月之光輝，拯斯民於水火之中，措天下於衽席之上，在此時也。何先生自歸豫州，曹兵一出，棄甲拋戈，望風而竄；上不能報劉表以安庶民，下不能輔孤子而據疆土；乃棄新野，走樊城，敗當陽，奔夏口，無容身之地？是豫州既得先生之後，反不如其初也。管仲、樂毅，果如是乎？愚直之言，幸勿見怪！」,"Zhang Zhao said, ""Be it so; but your words and your deeds are something discordant. You say you are the equal of the two famous ones. Well, Guan Zhong, as minister of Prince Huan, put his master at the very head of the feudal nobles, making his master's will supreme in all the land. Under the able statesmanship of Yue Yi, the feeble state of Yan conquered Qi, reducing nearly seventy of its cities. These two were men of most commanding and conspicuous talent.""When you lived in retirement, you smiled scornfully at ordinary people, passed your days in idleness, nursing your knees and posing in a superior manner, implying that if you had control of affairs, Liu Bei would be more than human; he should bring good to everybody and remove all evil; rebellion and robbery would be no more. Poor Liu Bei, before he obtained your help, was an outcast and a vagabond, stealing a city here and there where he could. With you to help him, he was to become the cynosure of every eye, and every lisping school child was to say that he was a tiger who had grown wings; the Hans were to be restored and Cao Cao and his faction exterminated; the good old days would be restored, and all the people who had been driven into retirement by the corruption of political life would wake up, rub the sleep out of their eyes, and be in readiness to lift the cloud of darkness that covered the sky and gaze up at the glorious brilliancy of the sun and moon, to pull the people out of fire and water and put all the world to rest on a couch of comfort. That was all supposed to happen forthwith.""Why then, when you went to Xinye, did not Cao Cao's army throw aside their arms and armors and flee like rats? Why could you not have told Liu Biao how to give tranquillity to his people? Why could you not aid his orphan son to protect his frontiers? Instead you abandoned Xinye and fled to Fancheng; you were defeated at Dangyang and fled to Xiakou with no place to rest in. Thus, after you had joined Liu Bei, he was worse off than before. Was it thus with Guan Zhong and Yue Yi? I trust you do not mind my blunt speech."""
孔明聽罷，啞然而笑曰：「鵬飛萬里，其志豈群鳥能識哉？譬如人染沈痾，當先用糜粥以飲之，和藥以服之；待其腑臟調和，形體漸安，然後用肉食以補之，猛藥以治之；則病根盡去，人得全生也。若不待氣脈和緩，便投以猛藥厚味，欲求安保，誠為難矣。吾主劉豫州，向日軍敗於汝南，寄跡劉表，兵不滿千，將止關、張、趙雲而已；此正如病勢尪羸已極之時也。新野山僻小縣，人民稀少，糧食鮮薄，豫州不過暫借以容身，豈真將坐守於此耶？夫以甲兵不完，城郭不固，軍不經練，糧不繼日，然而博望燒屯，白河用水，使夏侯惇、曹仁輩心驚膽裂。竊謂管仲、樂毅之用兵，未必過此。至於劉琮降操，豫州實出不知；且又不忍乘亂奪同宗之基業，此真大仁大義也。當陽之敗，豫州見有數十萬赴義之民，扶老攜幼相隨，不忍棄之，日行十里，不思進取江陵，甘與同敗，此亦大仁大義也。寡不敵眾，勝負乃其常事。昔高皇數敗於項羽，而垓下一戰成功，此非韓信之良謀乎？夫信久事高皇，未嘗累勝。蓋國家大計，社稷安危，是有主謀，非比誇辯之徒，虛譽欺人，──坐議立談，無人可及；臨機應變，百無一能。──誠為天下笑耳！」,"Zhuge Liang waited till Zhang Zhao had closed his oration, then laughed and said, ""How can the common birds understand the long flight of the cranes? Let me use an illustration. A man has fallen into a terrible malady. First the physician must administer hashish, then soothing drugs until his viscera shall be calmed into harmonious action. When the sick man's body shall have been reduced to quietude, then may he be given strong meats to strengthen him and powerful drugs to correct the disorder. Thus the disease will be quite expelled, and the man restored to health. If the physician does not wait till the humors and pulse are in harmony, but throws in his strong drugs too early, it will be difficult to restore the patient.""My master suffered defeat at Runan and went to Liu Biao. He had then less than one thousand soldiers and only three generals —-Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Zilong. That was indeed a time of extreme weakness. Xinye was a secluded, rustic town with few inhabitants and scanty supplies, and my master only retired there as a temporary refuge. How could he even think of occupying and holding it? Yet, with insufficient force, in a weak city, with untrained men and inadequate supplies, we burned Xiahou Dun at Bowang Slope, drowned Cao Ren and Cao Hong and their army in the White River, and set them in terror as they fled. I doubt whether the two ancient heroes would have done any better. As to the surrender of Liu Zong, Liu Bei knew nothing of it. And he was too noble and too righteous to take advantage of a kinsman's straits to seize his inheritance. As for the defeat at Dangyang, it must be remembered that Liu Bei was hampered with a huge voluntary following of common people, with their aged relatives and their children, whom he was too humane to abandon. He never thought of taking Jiangling, but willingly suffered with his people. This is a striking instance of his magnanimity.""Small forces are no match for large armies. Victory and defeat are common episodes in every campaign. The great Founder of the Hans suffered many defeats at the hands of Xiang Yu, but Liu Bang finally conquered at Gaixia, and that battle was decisive. Was not this due to the strategy of Han Xin who, though he had long served Liu Bang, had never won a victory. Indeed real statesmanship and the restoration of stable government is a master plan far removed from the vapid discourses and debates of a lot of bragging babblers and specious and deceitful talkers, who, as they themselves say, are immeasureably superior to the rest of humankind but who, when it comes to deeds and decisions to meet the infinite and constant vicissitudes of affairs, fail to throw up a single capable person. Truly such people are the laughing stock of all the world."""
這一篇言語，說得張昭並無一言回答。座上忽一人抗聲問曰：「今曹公兵屯百萬，將列千員，龍驤虎視，平吞江夏，公以為何如？」孔明視之，乃虞翻也。孔明曰：「曹操收袁紹蟻聚之兵，劫劉表烏合之眾，雖數百萬不足懼也。」虞翻冷笑曰：「軍敗於當陽，計窮於夏口，區區求救於人，而猶言不懼，此真大言欺人也！」孔明曰：「劉豫州以數千仁義之師，安能敵百萬殘暴之眾，退守夏口，所以待時也。今江東兵精糧足，且有長江之險，猶欲使其主屈膝降賊，不顧天下恥笑；由此論之，劉豫州真不懼操賊者矣！」,"Zhang Zhao found no reply to this diatribe.But another in the assembly lifted up his voice, saying, ""But what of Cao Cao's present position? There he is, encamped with one hundred legions and a thousand leaders. Whither he goes he is invincible as wriggling dragon, and whither he looks he is as fearsome as roaring tiger. He seems to have taken Jiangxia already, as we see."" The speaker was Yu Fan.And Zhuge Liang replied, ""Cao Cao has acquired the swarms of Yuan Shao and stolen the crowds of Liu Biao. Yet I care not for all his mob legions.""Yu Fan smiled icily, saying, ""When you got thrashed at Dangyang and in desperation sent this way and that to ask help, even then did you not care? But do you think big talk really takes people in?""Zhuge Liang replied, ""Liu Bei had a few thousand scrupulous soldiers to oppose against a million fierce brutes. He retired to Xiakou for breathing space. The South Land have strong and good soldiers, and there are ample supplies, and the Great River is a defense. Is now a time for you to convince your lord to bend the knee before a renegade, to be careless of his honor and reputation? As a fact Liu Bei is not the sort of man to fear such a rebel as Cao Cao."""
虞翻不能對。座間又一人問曰：「孔明欲效儀、秦之舌，游說東吳耶？」孔明視之，乃步騭也。孔明曰：「步子山以蘇秦、張儀為辯士，不知蘇秦、張儀亦豪傑也。蘇秦佩六國相卬，張儀兩次相秦，皆有匡扶人國之謀，非比畏強凌弱，懼刀避劍之人也。君等聞曹操虛發詐偽之詞，便畏懼請降，敢笑蘇秦、張儀乎？」,"Yu Fan had nothing to reply.Next, Bu Zhi, who was among those seated, said, ""Will you talk of our southern land with a tongue like the tongues of the persuaders Zhang Yi and Su Qin in the ancient time?""Zhuge Liang replied, ""You regard those two as mere speculative talkers; you do not recognize them also as heroes. Su Qin bore the Prime Ministers' seals of six federated states; Zhang Yi was twice Prime Minister of the state of Qin. Both were men of conspicuous ability who brought about the reformation of their governments. They are not to be compared with those who quail before the strong and overbear the weak, who fear the dagger and run away from the sword. You, Sir, have listened to Cao Cao's crafty and empty threat, and it has frightened you into advising surrender. Dare you ridicule Su Qin and Zhang Yi?"""
步騭默默然無語。忽一人問曰：「孔明以操何如人也。」孔明視其人，乃薛綜也。孔明答曰：「曹操乃漢賊也，又何必問？」綜曰：「公言差矣。漢歷傳至今，天數將終。今曹公已有天下三分之二，人皆歸心。劉豫州不識天時，強欲與爭，正如以卵擊石，安得不敗乎？」孔明厲聲曰：「薛敬文安得出此無父無君之言乎！夫人生天地間，以忠孝為立身之本。公既為漢臣，則見有不臣之人，當誓共戮之，臣之道也。今曹操祖宗叨食漢祿，不思報效，反懷纂逆之心，天下之所共憤。公乃以天數歸之，真無父無君之人也！不足與語！請勿復言！」,"Bu Zhi was silenced. Then suddenly another interjected the question, ""What do you think of Cao Cao?""It was Xue Zong who had spoken.And Zhuge Liang replied, ""Cao Cao is one of the rebels against the dynasty. Why ask about him?""""You are mistaken,"" said Xue Zong. ""The Hans have outlasted their allotted time, and the end is near. Cao Cao already has two-thirds of the empire, and people are turning to him. Your master has not recognized the fateful moment, and to contend with a man so strong is to try to smash stones with eggs. Failure is certain.""Zhuge Liang angrily replied, ""Why do you speak so undutiful words, as if you knew neither father nor prince? Loyalty and filial duty are the essentials of a person's being. For a minister of Han, correct conduct demands that one is pledged to the destruction of anyone who does not follow the canon of a minister's duty. Cao Cao's forbears enjoyed the bounty of Han, but instead of showing gratitude, he nourishes in his bosom thoughts of rebellion. The whole world is incensed against him, and yet you would claim for him the indication of destiny. Truly you are a man who knows neither father nor prince, a man unworthy of any words, and I decline to argue with you further."""
薛綜滿面羞慚，不能對答。座上又一人應聲問曰：「曹操雖挾天子以令諸侯，猶是相國曹參之後。劉豫州雖云中山靖王苗裔，卻無可稽考，眼見只是織蓆販屨之夫耳，何足與曹操抗衡哉！」孔明視之，乃陸績也。孔明笑曰：「公非袁術座間懷橘之陸郎乎？請安坐聽吾一言。曹操既為曹相國之後，則世為漢臣矣；今乃專權肆橫，欺凌君父，是不惟無君，亦且蔑祖；不惟漢室之亂臣，亦曹氏之賊子也！劉豫州堂堂帝冑，當今皇帝，按譜賜爵，何云無可稽考？且高祖起身亭長，而終有天下；織蓆販屨，又何足為辱乎？公小兒之見，不足與高士共語！」,"The blush of shame overspread Xue Zong's face, and he said no more.But another, Lu Ji, took up the dispute and said, ""Although Cao Cao overawes the Emperor and in his name coerces the nobles, yet he is the descendant of the Supreme Ancestor's Prime Minister Cao Shen; while your master, though he says he is descended from a prince, has no proof thereof. In the eyes of the world, Liu Bei is just a weaver of mats, a seller of straw shoes. Who is he to strive with Cao Cao?""Zhuge Liang laughed and replied, ""Are you not that Lu Ji who pocketed the orange when you were sitting among Yuan Shu's guests? Listen to me: I have a word to say to you. Inasmuch as Cao Cao is a descendant of a minister of state, he is by heredity a servant of the Hans. But now he has monopolized all state authority and knows only his own arbitrary will, heaping every indignity upon his lord. Not only does he forget his prince, but he ignores his ancestors; not only is he a rebellious servant of Han, but the renegade of his family. Liu Bei of Yuzhou is a noble scion of the imperial family upon whom the Emperor has conferred rank, as is recorded in the annals. How then can you say there is no evidence of his imperial origin? Beside, the very founder of the dynasty was himself of lowly origin, and yet he became emperor. Where is the shame in weaving mats and selling shoes? Your mean, immature views are unfit to be mentioned in the presence of scholars of standing."""
陸績語塞。座上一人忽曰：「孔明所言，皆強詞奪理，均非正論，不必再言。且請問孔明治何經典？」孔明視之，乃嚴畯也。孔明曰：「尋章摘句，世之腐儒也，何能興邦立事？且古耕莘、伊尹、釣渭、子牙、張良、陳平之流，鄧禹、耿弇之輩，皆有匡扶宇宙之才，未審其生平治何經典。豈亦效書生區區於筆硯之間，數黑論黃，舞文弄墨而已乎？」,"This put a stop to Lu Ji's flow of eloquence.But another of those present said, ""Zhuge Liang's words are overbearing, and he distorts reason. It is not proper argument, and he had better say no more. But I would ask him what classical canon he studied.""Zhuge Liang looked at his interlocutor, who was Yan Jun, and said, ""The dryasdusts of every age select passages and choose phrases. What else are they good for? Do they ever initiate a policy or manage an affair? Yi Yin, who was a farmer in the state of Shen, and Lu Wang, the fisherman of the River Wei, Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, Zheng Yu and Geng Yan —-all were men of transcendent ability, but I have never inquired what classical canon they followed or on whose essays they formed their style. Would you liken them to your rusty students of books, whose journeyings are comprised between their brush and their inkstone, who spend their days in literary futilities, wasting both time and ink?"""
嚴畯低頭喪氣而不能對。忽又一人大聲曰：「公好為大言，未必真有實學，恐適為儒者所笑耳。」孔明視其人，乃汝南程德樞也。孔明答曰：「儒有君子小人之別。君子之儒，忠君愛國，守正惡邪，務使澤及當時，名留後世。若夫小人之儒，惟務雕蟲，專工翰墨，青春作賦，皓首窮經；筆下雖有千言，胸中實無一策；且如揚雄以文章名世，而屈身事莽，不免投閣而死，此所謂小人之儒也；雖日賦萬言，亦何取哉！」,"No reply was forthcoming. Yan Jun hung his head with shame.But another disputant, Cheng Deshu by name, suddenly shouted, ""You are mightily fond of big words, Sir, but they do not give any proof of your scholarship after all. I am inclined to think that a real scholar would just laugh at you.""Zhuge Liang replied, ""There is the noble scholar, loyal and patriotic, of perfect rectitude and a hater of any crookedness. The concern of such a scholar is to act in full sympathy with his day and leave to future ages a fine reputation. There is the scholar of the mean type, a pedant and nothing more. He labors constantly with his pen, in his callow youth composing odes and in hoary age still striving to understand the classical books completely. Thousands of words flow from his pen, but there is not a solid idea in his breast. He may, as did Yang Xiong, glorify the age with his writings and yet stoop to serve a tyrant such as Wang Mang. No wonder Yang Xiong threw himself out of a window; he had to. That is the way of the scholar of mean type. Though he composes odes by the hundred, what is the use of him?"""
程德樞不能對。眾人見孔明對答如流，盡皆失色。時座上張溫、駱統二人，又欲問難。忽一人自外而入，厲聲言曰：「孔明乃當世奇才，君等以脣舌相難，非敬客之禮也。曹操大軍臨境，不思退敵之策，乃徒鬥口耶！」,"Cheng Deshu could make no reply. The other officers now began to hold this man of torrential speech in wholesome fear.Only two of them, Zhang Wen and Luo Tong, had failed to challenge him, but when they would have tried to pose Zhuge Liang, suddenly someone appeared from without and angrily shouted, ""This is not paying fit respect to a guest. You have among you the most wonderful man of the day, and you all sit there trying to entangle him in speech while our archenemy Cao Cao is nearing our borders. Instead of discussing how to oppose Cao Cao, you are all wrangling and disputing!"""
眾視其人，乃零陵人，姓黃，名蓋，字公覆，現為東吳糧官。當時黃蓋謂孔明曰：「愚聞多言獲利，不如默而無言。何不將金石之論為我主言之，乃與眾人辯論也？」孔明曰：「諸君不知世務，互相問難，不容不答耳。」,"All eyes turned toward the speaker. It was Huang Gai of Lingling, who was the Chief of the Commissariat of the South Land.He turned to address Zhuge Liang, saying, ""There is a saying that though something may be gained by talk, there is more to be got by silence. Why not give my lord the advantage of your valuable advice instead of wasting time in discussion with this crowd?""""They did not understand,"" replied Zhuge Liang, ""and it was necessary to enlighten them, so I had to speak."""
於是黃蓋與魯肅引孔明入；至中門，正遇諸葛瑾，孔明施禮。瑾曰：「賢弟既到江東，如何不來見我？」孔明曰：「弟既事豫州，理宜先公後私，公事未畢，不敢及私。望兄見諒。」瑾曰：「賢弟見過吳侯，卻來敘話。」說罷自去。,"As Huang Gai and Lu Su led the guest toward their master's apartments, they met his brother Zhuge Jin. Zhuge Liang saluted him with the deference due to an elder brother. Zhuge Jin said, ""Why have you not been to see me, brother?""""I am now in the service of Liu Bei of Yuzhou, and it is right that public affairs precede private obligations. I cannot attend to any private matters till my work is done. You must pardon me, brother.""""After you have seen Marquis Sun Quan, you will come and tell me your news,"" said he as he left."
魯肅曰：「適間所囑，不可有誤。」孔明點頭應諾。引至堂上，孫權降階而迎，優禮相待。施禮畢，賜孔明坐。眾文武分兩行而立。魯肅立於孔明之側，只看他講話。孔明致玄德之意畢，偷眼看孫權：碧眼紫鬚，堂堂儀表。孔明暗思：「此人相貌非常，只可激，不可說。等他問時，用言激之便了。」,"As they went along to the audience chamber, Lu Su again cautioned Zhuge Liang against any rash speech, saying, ""Do not tell the magnitude of Cao Cao's forces. Please remember.""The latter nodded but made no other reply. When they reached the hall, Sun Quan came down the steps to welcome his guests and was extraordinarily gracious. After the mutual salutations, the guest was given a chair while the Marquis' officials were drawn up in two lines, on one side the civil, on the other the military. Lu Su stood beside Zhuge Liang and listened to his introductory speech.As Zhuge Liang spoke of Liu Bei's intentions, he glanced up at his host. He noted the green eyes and purple beard and the dignified commanding air of the man and thought within himself, ""Certainly in appearance this is no common man. He is one to be incited perhaps, but not to be persuaded. It will be better to see what he has to say first, then I will try to stir him to action."""
獻茶已畢，孫權曰：「多聞魯子敬談足下之才，今幸得相見，敢求教益。」孔明曰：「不才無學，有辱明問。」權曰：「足下近在新野，佐劉豫州與曹操決戰，必深知彼軍虛實。」孔明曰：「劉豫州兵微將寡，更兼新野城小無糧，安能與曹操相持？」權曰：「曹兵共有多少？」孔明曰：「馬步水軍，約有一百餘萬。」權曰：「莫非詐乎？」孔明曰：「非詐也。曹操就兗州已有青州軍二十萬；平了袁紹，又得五六十萬；中原新招之兵三四十萬；今又得荊州之軍二三十萬：以此計之，不下一百五十萬。亮以百萬言之，恐驚江東之士也。」,"The serving of tea being now finished, Sun Quan began with the usual gracious ceremonial expressions.""Lu Su has often spoken of your genius,"" said the host. ""It is a great pleasure to meet you. I trust you will confer upon me the advantage of your instruction.""""I am neither clever nor learned,"" was the reply. ""It humiliates me to hear such words.""""You have been at Xinye lately, and you helped your master to fight that decisive battle with Cao Cao, so you must know exactly the measure of his military strength.""""My master's army was small and his generals were few; the city was paltry and lacked supplies. Hence no stand could be made against such a force as Cao Cao had.""""How many has he in all?""""Horse and foot, land and marine, he has a million.""""Is there not some doubt about that?"" said Sun Quan, surprised.""None whatever. When Cao Cao went to Yanzhou, he had the two hundred thousand soldiers of Qingzhou. He gained five or six hundred thousand more when Yuan Shao fell. He has three or four hundred thousand troops newly recruited in the capital. Lately he has acquired two or three hundred thousand troops in Jingzhou. And if these be reckoned up, the total is not less than a million and a half. Hence I said a million for I was afraid of frightening your officers."""
魯肅在旁，聞言失色，以目視孔明；孔明只做不見，權曰：「曹操部下戰將，還有多少？」孔明曰：「足智多謀之士，能征慣戰之將，何止一二千人！」權曰：「今曹操平了荊楚，復有遠圖乎？」孔明曰：「即今沿江下寨，準備戰船，不欲圖江東，待取何地？」權曰：「若彼有吞併之意，戰與不戰，請足下為我一決。」孔明曰：「亮有一言，但恐將軍不肯聽從。」權曰：「願聞高論。」孔明曰：「向者宇內大亂，故將軍起江東，劉豫州收眾漢南，與曹操並爭天下。今操芟除大難，略已平矣；近又新破荊州，威震海內；縱有英雄，無用武之地：故豫州遁逃至此。願將軍量力而處之。若能以吳越之眾，與中國抗衡，不如早與之絕；若其不能，何不從眾謀士之論，按兵束甲，北面而事之？」,"Lu Su was much disturbed and turned pale. He looked meaningfully at the bold speaker, but Zhuge Liang would not see. Sun Quan went on to ask if his archenemy had a corresponding number of leaders.""Cao Cao has enough administrators and strategists to control such a host, and his capable and veteran leaders are more than a thousand; perhaps more than two thousand.""""What will be Cao Cao's next move now that he has overcome Jingzhou?""""He is camped along the river, and he has collected a fleet. If he does not intend to invade the South Land, what can his intentions be?""""Since that is his intention, it is a case of fight or not fight. I wish you would decide that for me.""""I have something I could say, but I fear, Sir, you would not care to hear it.""""I am desirous of hearing your most valuable opinion.""""Strife has prevailed for a long time; and so you have raised your army in the South Land and Liu Bei collected his forces south of the Han River to act in contest for the empire against Cao Cao. Now Cao Cao has overcome most of his difficulties, and his recent conquest of Jingzhou has won him great and wide renown. Though there might be one bold enough to tackle him, yet there is no foothold for such. That is how Liu Bei has been forced to come here. But, General, I wish you to measure your forces and decide whether you can venture to meet Cao Cao and that without loss of time. If you cannot, then follow the advice of your councilors: Cease your military preparations and yield, turn your face to the north and serve."""
權未及答。孔明又曰：「將軍外託服從之名，內懷疑貳之見，事急而不斷，禍至無日矣。」權曰：「誠如君言，劉豫州何不降操？」孔明曰：「昔田橫齊之壯士耳，猶守義不辱，況劉豫州王室之冑，英才蓋世，眾士仰慕？事之不濟，此乃天也，又安能屈處人下乎？」,"Sun Quan did not reply. But his guest went on, ""You have the reputation of being reasonable, but I know also you are inclined to hesitate. Still this matter is most important, and evil will be quickly upon you if you do not decide.""Then replied Sun Quan, ""If what you say represents the actual conditions, why does not Liu Bei yield?""""Well, you know Tian Heng, that hero of the state of Qi: His character was too noble for him to submit to any shame. It is necessary to remember that Liu Bei also is an off-shoot from the Dynastic Family, beside being a man of great renown. Everyone looks up to him. His lack of success is simply the will of Heaven, but manifestly he could not bow the knee to anyone."""
孫權聽了孔明此言，不覺勃然變色，拂衣而起，退入後堂。眾皆哂笑而散。魯肅責孔明曰：「先生何故出此言？幸是吾主寬洪大度，不即面責。先生之言，藐視吾主甚矣。」孔明仰面笑曰：「何如此不能容物耶？我自有破曹之計，彼不問我，我故不言。」肅曰：「果有良策，肅當請主公求教。」孔明曰：「吾視曹操百萬之眾，如群蟻耳！但我一舉手，則皆為虀粉矣！」,"These last words touched Sun Quan to the quick, and he could not control his anger. He shook out his sleeves, rose, and left the audience chamber. Those present smiled at each other as they dispersed.But Lu Su was annoyed and reproached Zhuge Liang for his maladroit way of talking to Sun Quan, saying, ""Luckily for you, my lord is too large-minded to rebuke you to your face, for you spoke to him most contemptuously.""Zhuge Liang threw back his head and laughed.""What a sensitive fellow it is!"" cried he. ""I know how Cao Cao could be destroyed, but he never asked me. So I said nothing.""""If you really do know how that could be done, I will certainly beg my lord to ask you.""""Cao Cao's hosts in my eyes are but as swarms of ants. I have but to lift my hand, and they will be crushed,"" said Zhuge Liang."
肅聞言，便入後堂，見孫權。權怒氣未息，顧謂肅曰：「孔明欺吾太甚！」肅曰：「臣亦以此責孔明，孔明反笑主公不能容物，破曹之策，孔明不肯輕言。主公何不求之？」權回嗔作喜曰：「原來孔明有良謀，故以言詞激我。我一時淺見，幾誤大事。」便同魯肅重復出堂，再請孔明敘話。權見孔明，謝曰：「適來冒瀆清嚴，幸勿見罪。」孔明亦謝曰：「亮言語冒犯，望乞恕罪。」權邀孔明入後堂，置酒相待。,"Lu Su at once went into his master's private room, where he found Sun Quan still very irritable and angry.""Zhuge Liang insulted me too deeply,"" said Sun Quan.""I have already reproached him,"" said Lu Su, ""and he laughed and said you were too sensitive. He would not give you any advice without being asked for it. Why did you not seek advice from him, my lord?""At once Sun Quan's anger changed to joy.He said, ""So he had a plan ready, and his words were meant to provoke me. I did despise him for a moment, and it has very nearly lost me.""So Sun Quan returned to the audience chamber where the guest was still seated and begged Zhuge Liang to continue his speech.Sun Quan spoke courteously, saying, ""I offended you just now. I hope you are not implacable.""""And I also was rude,"" replied Zhuge Liang. ""I entreat pardon.""Host and guest retired to the inner room where wine was served."
數巡之後，權曰：「曹操平生所惡者，呂布、劉表、袁紹、袁術、豫州與孤耳。今數雄已滅，獨豫州與孤尚存。孤不能以全吳之地，受制於人。吾計決矣。非劉豫州莫與當曹操者。然豫州新敗之後，安能抗此難乎？」孔明曰：「豫州雖新敗，然關雲長猶率精兵萬人；劉琦領江夏戰士，亦不下萬人。曹操之眾，遠來疲憊；近追豫州，輕騎一日夜行三百里。此所謂「強弩之末，勢不能穿魯縞」者也。且北方之人，不習水戰。荊州士民附操者，迫於勢耳，非本心也。今將軍誠能與豫州協力同心，破曹軍必矣。操軍破必北還，則荊吳之勢強，而鼎足之形成矣。成敗之機，在於今日。惟將軍裁之。」,"After it had gone round several times, Sun Quan said, ""The enemies of Cao Cao were Lu Bu, Liu Biao, Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, Liu Bei, and my poor self. Now most of these are gone, and only Liu Bei and I remain. I will never allow the land of Wu to be dictated to by another. The only one who could have withstood Cao Cao was Liu Bei, but he has been defeated lately and what can he do now against such force?""Zhuge Liang replied, ""Although defeated, Liu Bei still has Guan Yu with ten thousand veterans. And Liu Qi still leads the troops of Jiangxia, another ten thousand. Cao Cao's army is far from home, and the soldiers are worn out. They made a frantic effort to come up with my master, and the light horse marched one hundred miles in a day and a night. This was the final kick of the crossbow spring, and the bolt was not swift enough to penetrate even the thin silken vesture of Lu. The army can do no more. They are northern people, unskilled in water warfare, and the people of Jingzhou are unwilling supporters. They have no desire to help Cao Cao. Now if you, General, will assist Liu Bei, Cao Cao will certainly be broken, and he must retire northwards. Then your country and Jingzhou will be strong, and the tripod will be firmly established. But the scheme must be carried out without delay, and only you can decide."""
權大悅曰：「先生之言，頓開茅塞。吾意已決，更無他疑。即日商議起兵，共滅曹操。」遂令魯肅將此意傳諭文武官員，就送孔明於館驛安歇。,"Sun Quan joyfully replied, ""Your words, Master, open up the road clearly. I have decided and shall have no further doubts.""So the orders were issued forthwith to prepare for a joint attack on Cao Cao. And Sun Quan bade Lu Su bear the news of his decision to all his officers. He himself escorted Zhuge Liang to the guest-quarters and saw to his comfort."
張昭知孫權欲興兵，遂與眾議曰：「中了孔明之計也！」急入見權曰：「昭等聞主公將興兵與曹操爭鋒。主公自思比袁紹若何？曹操向日兵微將寡，尚能一鼓克袁紹，何況今日擁百萬之眾南征，豈可輕敵？若聽諸葛亮之言，妄動甲兵，此所謂負薪救火也。」孫權只低頭不語。顧雍曰：「劉備因為曹操所敗，故欲借我江東之兵以拒之，主公奈何為其所用乎？願聽子布之言。」,"When Zhang Zhao heard of the decision he met his colleagues and said to them, ""Our master has fallen into the trap set by this Zhuge Liang.""They went in a body to their lord and said, ""We hear you are going to attack Cao Cao. But how do you stand when compared with Yuan Shao? In those days Cao Cao was comparatively weak, and yet he overcame. What is he like today with his countless legions? He is not to be lightly attacked, and to listen to Zhuge Liang's advice to engage in a conflict is like carrying fuel to a fire.""Sun Quan made no reply, and Gu Yong took up the argument.Gu Yong said, ""Liu Bei has been defeated, and he wants to borrow our help to beat his enemy. Why must our lord lend himself to his schemes? Pray listen to our leader's words."""
孫權沈吟未決。張昭等出，魯肅入見曰：「適張子布等，又勸主公休動兵，力主降議，此皆全軀保妻子之臣，為自謀之計耳。願主公勿聽也。」孫權尚在沈吟。肅曰：「主公若遲疑，必為眾人誤矣。」權曰：「卿且暫退，容我三思。」肅乃退出。時武將或有要戰的，文官都是要降的，議論紛紛不一。,"Doubts again surged up in the mind of Sun Quan.When the troop of advisers had retired, Lu Su came in, saying, ""They came to exhort you not to fight, but to compel you to surrender. All this is simply because they wish to secure the safety of their families. They distort their sense of duty to serve their own ends, and I hope you will not take their advice.""Sun Quan being sunk in thought and saying nothing, Lu Su went on, ""If you hesitate, you will certainly be led astray by the majority and ——-""""Retire for a time,"" said his master. ""I must think it over carefully.""So Lu Su left the chamber. Among the soldiers some wished for war, but of the civil officers, all were in favor of surrender; and so there were many discussions and much conflict of opinion."
且說孫權退入內宅，寢食不安，猶豫不決。吳國太見權如此，問曰：「何事在心，寢食俱廢？」權曰：「今曹操屯兵於江漢，有下江南之意。問諸文武，或欲降者，或欲戰者。欲待戰來，恐寡不敵眾；欲待降來，又恐曹操不容：因此猶豫不決。」吳國太曰：「汝何不記吾姐臨終之語乎？」孫權如醉方醒，似夢初覺，想出這句話來。正是：追思國母臨終語，引得周郎立戰功。畢竟說著甚的，且看下文分解。,"Sun Quan went to his private apartments greatly perplexed. There his worry was easily discernible, and he neither ate nor slept. He was quite unable to decide finally upon a course of action.Then Lady Wu, the sister of his late mother, whom he also regarded as his own mother, asked him what so troubled him, and he told her of the threatened danger of Cao Cao and the different opinions his advisers held one and another and all his doubts and fears.""If I fight, I might fail. But if I offer to surrender, perhaps Cao Cao will not tolerate me,"" said he.Then she replied, ""Have you forgotten the last words of my sister?""As to one recovering from a fit of drunkenness, or waking out of a dream, so came to him the dying words of the mother who bore him.His mother's advice he called to mind,""In Zhou Yu's counsels you safety find.""What happened will be told in the next chapter."
