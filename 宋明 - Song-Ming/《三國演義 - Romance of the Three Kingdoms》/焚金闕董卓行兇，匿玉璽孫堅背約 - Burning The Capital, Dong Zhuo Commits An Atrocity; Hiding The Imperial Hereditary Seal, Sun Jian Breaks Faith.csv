卻說張飛拍馬趕到關下，關上矢石如雨，不得進而回。八路諸侯，同請玄德、關、張賀功，使人去袁紹寨中報捷。紹遂移檄孫堅，令其進兵。堅引程普，黃蓋，至袁術寨中相見。堅以杖畫地曰：「董卓與我，本無讎隙。今我奮不顧身，親冒矢石，來決死戰者：上為國家討賊，下為將軍家門之私；而將軍卻聽讒言，不發糧草，致堅敗績，將軍何安！」,"Zhang Fei rode hard up to the Pass, but the defenders sent down stones and arrows like rain so that he could not enter, and he returned. The eight lords all joined in felicitations to the three brothers for their services, and the story of victory was sent to Yuan Shao, who ordered Sun Jian to make an immediate advance. Thereupon Sun Jian with two trusty generals, Cheng Pu and Huang Gai, went over to the camp of Yuan Shu. Tracing figures on the ground with his staff, Sun Jian said, ""Dong Zhuo and I had no personal quarrel. Yet now I have thrown myself into the battle regardless of consequences, exposed my person to the risk of wounds and fought bloody battles to their bitter end. And why? That I might be the means of ridding my country of a rebel and —-for the private advantage of your family. Yet you, heeding the slanderous tongue of certain counselor, formerly withheld the supplies absolutely necessary to me, and so I suffered defeat. How can you explain, General?"""
術惶恐無言，命斬進讒之人，以謝孫堅。忽人報堅曰：「關上有一將，乘馬來寨中，要見將軍。」堅辭袁術，歸到本寨，喚來問時，乃董卓愛將李傕。堅曰：「汝來何為？」傕曰：「丞相所敬者，惟將軍耳。今特使傕來結親：丞相有女，欲配將軍之子。」堅大怒，叱曰：「董卓逆天無道，蕩覆王室，吾欲夷其九族，以謝天下，安肯與逆賊結親耶！吾不斬汝！汝當速去，早早獻關，饒你性命！倘若遲誤，粉骨碎身！」,"Yuan Shu, confused and frightened, had no word to reply. He ordered the death of the slanderer to placate Sun Jian. Then suddenly they told Sun Jian, ""Some officer has come riding down from the Pass to see you, General. He is in the camp.""Sun Jian therefore took his leave and returned to his own camp, where he found the visitor was Li Jue, one of the much trusted commanders of Dong Zhuo.""Wherefore come you?"" said Sun Jian.Li Jue replied, ""You are the one person for whom my master has respect and admiration, and he sends me to arrange a matrimonial alliance between the two families. He wishes that his daughter may become the wife of your son.""""What! Dong Zhuo, that rebel and renegade, that subverter of the Throne! I wish I could destroy his nine generations as a thank-offering to the empire! Think you I would be willing to have an alliance with such a family? I will not slay you as I ought, but go, and go quickly! Yield the Pass and I may spare your lives. If you delay, I will grind your bones to powder and make mincemeat of your flesh!"""
李傕抱頭鼠竄，回見董卓，說孫堅如此無禮。卓怒，問李儒。儒曰：「溫侯新敗，兵無戰心。不若引兵回洛陽，遷帝於長安，以應童謠。近日街市童謠曰：『西頭一個漢，東頭一個漢。鹿走入長安，方可無斯難。』臣思此言，『西頭一個漢』，乃應高祖旺於西都長安，傳一十二帝；『東頭一個漢』，乃應光武旺於東都洛陽，今亦傳一十二帝。天運合回，丞相遷回長安，方可無虞。」卓大喜曰：「非汝言，吾實不悟。」遂引呂布星夜回洛陽，商議遷都。聚文武於朝堂，卓曰：「漢東都洛陽，二百餘年，氣數已衰。吾觀旺氣實在長安，吾欲奉駕西幸。汝等各宜促裝。」,"Li Jue threw his arms over his head and ran out. He returned to his master and told him what a rude reception he had met with. Dong Zhuo asked his adviser Li Ru how to reply to this. Li Ru said, ""Lu Bu's late defeat had somewhat blunted the edge of our army's desire for battle. It would be well to return to the capital and remove the Emperor to Changan, as the street children had been lately singing:""A Han on the west, a Han on the east.The deer (emperor) in Changan shall worry least.""Li Ru continued, ""If you think out this couplet, it applies to the present juncture. Half the first line refers to the founder of the dynasty, Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor, who became ruler in the western city of Changan, which was the capital during twelve reigns. The other half corresponds to Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder who ruled from Luoyang, the eastern capital during twelve latter reigns. The revolution of the heavens brings us back to this starting moment. Thus if you remove to Changan, there will be no need for anxiety.""Dong Zhuo was exceedingly pleased and said, ""Had you not spoken thus, I should not have understood!"" Then taking Lu Bu with him, Dong Zhuo started at once for Capital Luoyang.Here he called all the officials to a great council in the Palace and addressed them, ""After two centuries of rule here, the royal fortune has been exhausted, and I perceive that the aura of rule has migrated to Changan, whither I now desire to move the court. All you had better pack up for the journey."""
司徒楊彪曰：「關中殘破零落。今無故捐宗廟，棄皇陵，恐百姓驚動。天下動之至易，安之至難：望丞相鋻察。」卓怒曰：「汝阻國家大計耶？」太尉黃琬曰：「楊司徒之言是也；往者王莽篡逆，更始赤眉之時，焚燒長安，盡為瓦礫之地；更兼人民流移，百無一二；今棄宮室而就荒地，非所宜也。」卓曰：「關東賊起，天下播亂；長安有崤、函之險；更近隴右，木石磚瓦，剋日可辦，宮室營造，不須月餘。汝等再休亂言。」司徒苟爽諫曰：「丞相若欲遷都，百姓騷動不寧矣。」卓大怒曰：「吾為天下計，豈惜小民哉！」即日罷楊彪、黃琬、荀爽為庶民。,"Yang Biao, Minister of the Interior, said, ""I pray you reflect. The Land Within the Passes is all destruction. There is no reason to renounce the ancestral temples and abandon the imperial tombs here. I fear the people will be alarmed. It is easy to alarm them but difficult to pacify them.""""Do you oppose the state plans?"" said Dong Zhuo angrily.Another official, Grand Commander Huang Wan, supported his colleague, ""In the era of Recommencement (AD 23-25), Fan Chong of the Red Eyebrows rebels burned Changan to the ground and reduced the place to broken tiles. The inhabitants scattered all but a few. It is wrong to abandon these palaces here for a wasteland.""Dong Zhuo replied, ""The East of the Passes is full of sedition, and all the empire is in rebellion. The city of Changan is protected by the Yaohan Mountains and the Hangu Pass. Moreover, it is near Longyou, whence can be easily brought timber, stone, brick, and building materials. In a month or so palaces can be erected. So an end to your wild words!""Yet Minister of Works Xun Shuang raised another protest against disturbing the people, but Dong Zhuo overbore him also.""How can I stop to consider a few common people when my scheme affects the empire?"" said Dong Zhuo.That day the three objectors —-Yang Biao, Huang Wan, and Xun Shuang —-were removed from their offices and reduced to the rank of commoners."
卓出上車，只見二人望車而揖；視之，乃尚書周毖、城門校尉伍瓊也。卓問有何事，毖曰：「今聞丞相欲遷都長安，故來諫耳。」卓大怒曰：「我始初聽你兩個，保用袁紹；今紹已反，是汝等一黨！」叱武士推出都門斬首。遂下令遷都，限來日便行。李儒曰：「今錢糧缺少，洛陽富戶極多，可籍沒入官。但是袁紹等門下，殺其宗黨而抄其家貲，必得巨萬。」,"As Dong Zhuo went out to get into his coach, he met two other officers who made obeisance. They were the Chair of the Secretariat, Zhou Bi, and the Commander of the City Gates, Wu Qiong. Dong Zhuo stopped and asked them what they wanted.Said Zhou Bi, ""We venture to try to dissuade you from moving the capital to Changan.""Dong Zhuo replied, ""You two persuaded me to give Yuan Shao office. Now he has already turned traitor, and you are of the same party!""And without more ado he bade his guards take both outside the city and put them to death. The command to remove to the new capital immediately was issued.Speaking to Dong Zhuo, Li Ru pointed out, ""We are short of money and food, and the rich people of Luoyang could be easily plundered. This is a good occasion to link them to the rebels and to confiscate their properties."""
卓即差鐵騎五千，遍行捉拏洛陽富戶，共數千家，插旗頭上，大書「反臣逆黨」，盡斬於城外，取其金貲。李傕，郭汜，盡驅洛陽之民數百萬口，前赴長安。每百姓一隊，間軍一隊，互相拖押；死於溝壑者，不可勝數。又縱軍士淫人妻女，奪人糧食；啼哭之聲，震動天地。如有行得遲者，背後三千軍催督，軍手執白刃，於路殺人。,"Dong Zhuo sent five thousand troops out to plunder and slay. They captured many thousand wealthy householders and, having stuck flags on their heads saying they were Traitors and Rebels, drove them out of the city and put them to death. Their properties were all seized.The task of driving forth the inhabitants, some millions, was given to two of Dong Zhuo's commanders, Li Jue and Guo Si. The people were sent off in bands, each band between two parties of soldiers, who drove them torward Changan. Enormous numbers fell by the road side and died in the ditches, and the escort plundered the fugitives and defiled the women. A wail of sorrow arose to the very sky."
卓臨行，教諸門放火，焚燒居民房屋，並放火燒宗廟宮府。南北兩宮，火焰相接；洛陽宮庭，盡為焦土。又差呂布發掘先皇及后妃陵寢，取其金寶。軍士乘勢掘官民墳塚殆盡。董卓裝載金珠緞疋好物數千餘車，劫了天子並后妃等，竟望長安去了。,"Dong Zhuo's final orders as he left Capital Luoyang were to burn the whole city: Houses, palaces, temples, and everything were devoured by the flames. The capital became but a patch of scorched earth.Dong Zhuo sent Lu Bu to desecrate the tombs of the emperors and their consorts for the jewels therein, and the common soldiers took the occasion to dig up the graves of officials and plunder the cemeteries of the wealthy. The spoil of the city, gold and silver, pearls and silks, and beautiful ornaments, filled several thousand carts. With these and the persons of the Emperor and his household, Dong Zhuo moved off to the new capital in the first year of Inauguration of Tranquillity (AD 190)."
卻說卓將趙岑，見卓已棄洛陽而去，便獻了汜水關。孫堅驅兵先入，玄德、關、張殺入虎牢關，諸侯各引軍入。,"Luoyang being thus abandoned, the general of Dong Zhuo at River Si Pass, Zhao Cen, evacuated that post of vantage, which Sun Jian at once occupied. Liu Bei and his brothers took Tiger Trap Pass and the confederate lords advanced."
且說孫堅飛奔洛陽，遙望火焰沖天，黑煙鋪地，二三百里，並無雞犬人煙；堅先發兵救滅了火，令眾諸侯各於荒地上屯住軍馬。曹操來見袁紹曰：「今董賊西去，正可乘勢追襲；本初按兵不動，何也？」紹曰：「諸兵疲困，進恐無益。」操曰：「董賊焚燒宮室，劫遷天子，海內震動，不知所歸；此天亡之時也，一戰而天下定矣。諸侯何疑而不進？」眾諸侯皆言不可輕動。操大怒曰：「豎子不足與謀！」遂自引兵萬餘，領夏侯惇，夏侯淵，曹仁，曹洪，李典，樂進，星夜來趕董卓。,"Sun Jian hastened to the late capital which was still in flames. When he arrived, dense smoke hung all over it and spread for miles around. No living thing, not a fowl, or a dog, or a human being, remained. Sun Jian told off his soldiers to extinguish the fires and set out camping places for the confederate lords. Cao Cao went to see Yuan Shao and said, ""Dong Zhuo has gone west. We ought to follow and attack his rear without loss of time. Why do you remain inactive?""""All our colleagues are worn out, and there is nothing to be gained by attack,"" said Yuan Shao.Cao Cao said, ""This moment was most propitious in the utter confusion that reigned —-palaces burned, the Emperor abducted, the whole world upset, and no one knowing whither to turn. The villain will soon be ended, and a single blow could exterminate Dong Zhuo. Why not pursue?""But all the confederate lords seemed of one mind, and that mind was to postpone action. So they did nothing.""Those unworthy people cannot discuss worthy thing!"" cried Cao Cao.Then, he and his six generals —-Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Cao Ren, Cao Hong, Li Dian, and Yue Jing —-and ten thousand troops started in pursuit."
且說董卓行至滎陽地方，太守徐榮出接。李儒曰：「丞相新棄洛陽，防有追兵。可教徐榮伏軍滎陽城外山塢之旁：若有兵追來，可竟放過；待我這裏殺敗，然後截住掩殺。令後來者不敢復追。」卓從其計，又令呂布引精兵遏後。布正行間，曹操一軍趕上。呂布大笑曰：「不出李儒所料也」！將軍馬擺開。曹操出馬，大叫：「逆賊！劫遷天子，流徙百姓，將欲何往？」呂布罵曰：「背主懦夫，何得妄言！」夏侯惇挺鎗躍馬，直取呂布。戰不數合，李傕引一軍，從左邊殺來，操急令夏侯淵迎敵。右邊喊聲又起，郭汜引軍殺到，操急令曹仁迎敵。三路軍馬，勢不可當。夏侯惇抵敵呂布不住，飛馬回陣。布引鐵騎掩殺，操軍大敗，回望滎陽而走。走至一荒山腳下，時約二更，月明如晝。方纔聚集殘兵。,"The road to the new capital led through Yingyang. When Dong Zhuo reached it, Governor Xu Rong went to welcome the cavalcade.Li Ru said, ""As there is some danger of pursuit, it would be well to order the Governor of this place to lay an ambush outside the city. He is to let the pursuers pass and be ready to cut off their retreat, when our army beats them off. That will teach any others not to follow.""Then Dong Zhuo ordered Lu Bu to command the rear guard. Very soon they saw Cao Cao coming up, and Lu Bu laughed at his colleague's foresight. He set out his troops in fighting order.Cao Cao rode forward, crying, ""Rebels, abductors, drovers of the people, where are you going?""Lu Bu replied, ""Treacherous simpleton, what mad words are these?""Then from Cao Cao army rode forth Xiahou Dun with his spear set, and Lu Bu and Xiahou Dun engaged. The combat had hardly begun when Li Ru with a cohort came in from the left. Cao Cao bade Xiahou Yuan meet this onslaught. However, on the other side appeared Guo Si and his company. Cao Cao sent Cao Ren against Guo Si. The onrush on three sides was too much to withstand, and Lu Bu's army was overwhelming, so Xiahou Dun had to retire to the main line. Thereupon Lu Bu's armored troops attacked and completed the defeat. The beaten army of Cao Cao turned toward Yingyang. They got as far as the foot of a hill in the evening about the second watch, and the moon made it as light as day. Here they halted to reform."
正欲埋鍋造飯，只聽得四圍喊聲，徐榮伏兵盡出。曹操慌忙策馬，奪路奔逃，正遇徐榮，轉身便走。榮搭上箭，射中操肩膊。操帶箭逃命，轉過山坡。兩個軍士伏於草中，見操馬來，二鎗齊發，操馬中鎗而倒。操翻身落馬，被二卒擒住。只見一將飛馬而來，揮刀砍死兩個步軍，下馬救起曹操。操視之，乃曹洪也。操曰：「吾死於此矣，賢弟可速去！」洪曰：「公急上馬！洪願步行。」操曰：「賊兵趕上，汝將奈何？」洪曰：「天下可無洪，不可無公。」操曰：「吾若再生，汝之力也。」操上馬，洪脫去衣甲，拖刀跟馬而走。約走至四更餘，只見前面一條大河，阻住去路，後面喊聲漸近。操曰：「命已至此，不得復活矣！」洪急扶操下馬，脫去袍鎧，負操渡水。纔過彼岸，追兵已到，隔水放箭。操帶水而走。比及天明，又走三十餘里，土岡下少歇。忽然喊聲起處，一彪人馬趕來，卻是徐榮從上流渡河來追。,"Just as they were burying the boilers to prepare a meal, there arose a great noise of shouting on all sides and out came the troops of Governor Xu Rong from the ambush fresh to attack.Cao Cao, thrown into a flurry, mounted and fled. He ran right in the way of the waiting Xu Rong. Then he dashed off in another direction, but Xu Rong shot an arrow after him which struck him in the shoulder. The arrow still in the wound, Cao Cao fled for his life. As he went over the hill, two soldiers lying in wait among the grass suddenly dashed out and wounded his horse, which fell and rolled over. And as he slipped from the saddle, he was seized and made prisoner.Just then a horseman came, riding at full speed and whirling his sword up, cut down both the captors, and rescued Cao Cao. It was Cao Hong.Cao Cao said, ""I am doomed, good brother. Go and save yourself!""""My lord, mount my horse quickly! I will go afoot,"" said Cao Hong.""If those wretches come up, what then?"" said Cao Cao.""The world can do without Cao Hong, but not without you, my lord!""""If I live, I shall owe you my life,"" said Cao Cao.So he mounted. Cao Hong tore off his own breastplate, gripped his sword, and went on foot after the horse. Thus they proceeded till the fourth watch when they saw before them a broad stream, and behind they still heard the shouts of pursuers drawing nearer and nearer.""This is my fate,"" said Cao Cao. ""I am really doomed!""Cao Hong helped Cao Cao down from his horse. Then taking off his fighting robe and helmet, Cao Hong took the wounded man on his back and waded into the stream. When they reached the further side, the pursuers had already gained the bank whence they shot arrows. Cao Cao all wet pushed on. Dawn was near. They went on another ten miles and then sat down to rest under a precipice. Suddenly loud shouting was heard and a party of horse appeared. It was Governor Xu Rong who had forded the river higher up."
操正慌急問，只見夏侯惇、夏侯淵引十數騎飛至，大喝：「徐榮勿傷吾主！」徐榮便奔夏侯惇，惇挺鎗來迎。交馬數合，惇刺徐榮於馬下，殺散餘兵。隨後曹仁，李典，樂進，各引兵尋到；見了曹操，憂喜交集；聚集殘兵五百餘人，同回河內。卓兵自往長安。,"Just at this moment Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan, with several dozens men, came along.""Hurt not my lord!"" cried Xiahou Dun to Xu Rong, who at once rushed at him.But the combat was short. Xu Rong speedily fell under a spear thrust of Xiahou Dun, and his troops were driven off. Before long Cao Cao's other generals arrived. Sadness and joy mingled in the greetings. They gathered together the few hundreds of soldiers left and then returned to Luoyang."
卻說眾諸侯分屯洛陽。孫堅救滅宮中餘火，屯兵城內，設帳於建章殿基上。堅令軍士掃除宮殿瓦礫。凡董卓所掘陵寢，盡皆掩閉。於太廟基上，草創殿屋三間，請眾諸侯立列聖神位，宰太牢祀之。祭畢，皆散。堅歸寨中，是夜星日交輝，乃按劍露坐，仰觀天文。見紫微垣中白氣漫漫，堅歎曰：「帝星不明，賊臣亂國，萬民塗炭，京城一空！」言訖，不覺淚下。,"When the confederate lords entered Luoyang, Sun Jian, after extinguishing the fires, camped within the walls, his own tent being set up near the Dynastic Temple. His people cleared away the debris and closed the rifted tombs. The gates were barred. On the site of the Dynastic Temple he put up a mat shed containing three apartments, and here he begged the lords to meet and replace the sacred tablets, with solemn sacrifices and prayers.This ceremony over, the others left and Sun Jian returned to his camp. That night the stars and moon vied with each other in brightness. As Sun Jian sat in the open air looking up at the heavens, he noticed a mist spreading over the stars of the Constellation Draco.""The Emperor's star is dulled,"" said Sun Jian with a sigh. ""No wonder a rebellious minister disturbs the state, the people sit in dust and ashes, and the capital is a waste."" And his tears began to fall."
傍有軍士指曰：「殿南有五色豪光起於井中。」堅喚軍士點起火把，下井打撈。撈起一婦人屍首，雖然日久，其屍不爛，宮樣裝束，項下帶一錦囊。取開看時，內有硃紅小匣，用金鎖鎖著。啟視之，乃一玉璽：方圓四寸。上鑴五龍交紐；傍缺一角，以黃金鑲之；上有篆文八字云：「受命於天，既壽永昌」。,"Then a soldier pointing to the south said, ""There is a beam of colored light rising from a well!""Sun Jian bade his people light torches and descend into the well. Soon they brought up the corpse of a woman, not in the least decayed although it had been there many days. She was dressed in Palace clothing and from her neck hung an embroidered bag. Opening this a red box was found, with a golden lock, and when the box was opened, they saw a jade seal, square in shape, four inches each way. On it were delicately engraved five dragons intertwined. One corner had been broken off and repaired with gold. There were eight characters in the seal style of engraving which interpreted read:I have received the command from Heaven: May my time be always long and prosperous."
堅得璽，乃問程普。普曰：「此傳國璽也。此玉是昔日卞和於荊山之下，見鳳凰棲於石上，載而進之楚文王。解之，果得玉。秦二十六年，令玉工琢為璽，李斯篆此八字於其上。二十八年，始皇巡狩至洞庭湖，風浪大作，舟將覆，急投玉璽於湖而止。至三十六年，始皇巡狩至華陰，有人持璽遮道，與從者曰：『持此還祖龍。』言訖不見。此璽復歸於秦。明年，始皇崩。後來子嬰將玉璽獻與漢高祖。後至王莽篡逆，孝元皇太后將璽打王尋，蘇獻，崩其一角，以金鑲之。光武得此寶於宜陽，傳位至今。近聞十常侍作亂，劫少帝出北邙，回宮失此寶。今天授主公，必有登九五之分。此處不可久留，宜速回江東，別圖大事。」堅曰：「汝言正合吾意。明日便當託疾辭歸。」商議已定，密諭軍士勿得洩漏。,"Sun Jian showed this to his adviser, General Cheng Pu, who at once recognized it as the Imperial Hereditary Seal of the Emperor.Cheng Pu said, ""This seal has a history. In olden days Bian He saw a phoenix sitting on a certain stone at the foot of the Jing Mountains. He offered the stone at court. The King of Chu split open the stone and found a piece of jade. In the twenty-sixth year of Qin Dynasty (BC 221), a jade cutter made a seal from it, and Li Si, the First Emperor's Prime Minister, engraved the characters. Two years later, while the First Emperor was sailing in Dongting Lake, a terrific storm arrived. The Emperor threw the seal to the water as a propitiatory offering, and the storm immediately ceased. Ten years later again, when the First Emperor was making a progress and had reached Huaying, an old man by the road side handed a seal to one of the attendants saying, 'This is now restored to the ancestral dragon!' and had then disappeared. Thus the jewel returned to Qin.""The next year the First Emperor died. Later Zi Ying, the last Emperor of Qin and grandson of the First Emperor, presented the seal to Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor, the founder of Han Dynasty. Two hundred years later, in Wang Mang's rebellion, the Emperor's mother, Lady Yuan, struck two of the rebels, Wang Xun and Su Xian, with the seal and broke off a corner, which was repaired with gold. Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder got possession of it at Yiyang, and it has been regularly bequeathed hereafter.""I heard this treasured seal had been lost during the trouble in the Palace when the Ten Regular Attendants hurried off the Emperor. It was missed on His Majesty's return. Now my lord has it and certainly will come to the imperial dignity. But you must not remain here in the north. Quickly go home to the south of the Great River, where you can lay plans for the accomplishment of the great design.""""Your words exactly accord with my thoughts,"" said Sun Jian. ""Tomorrow I will make an excuse that I am unwell and get away.""The soldiers were told to keep the discovery a secret."
誰想數中一軍，是袁紹鄉人，欲假此為進身之計，連夜偷出營寨，來報袁紹。紹與之賞賜，暗留軍中。次日，孫堅來辭袁紹曰：「堅抱小疾，欲歸長沙，特來別公。」紹笑曰：「吾知公疾乃害傳國璽耳。」堅失色曰：「此言何來？」紹曰：「今興民討賊，為國除害。玉璽乃朝廷之寶，公既獲得，當對眾留盟主處，候誅了董卓，復歸朝廷。今匿之而去，意欲何為？」堅曰：「玉璽何由在吾處？」紹曰：「建章殿井中之物何在？」堅曰：「吾本無之，何強相逼？」紹曰：「作速取出，免自生禍。」堅指天為誓曰：「吾若果得此寶，私自藏匿，異日不得善終，死於刀箭之下！」眾諸侯曰：「文臺如此說誓，想必無之。」紹喚軍士出曰：「打撈之時，有此人否？」堅大怒，拔所佩之劍，要斬那軍士。紹亦拔劍曰：「汝斬軍士，乃欺我也。」紹背後顏良、文醜皆拔劍出鞘。堅背後程普，黃蓋，韓當，亦掣刀在手。眾諸侯一齊勸住。堅隨即上馬，拔寨離洛陽而去。紹大怒，遂寫書一封，差心腹人連夜往荊州，送與刺史劉表，教就路上截住奪之。,"But one among them was a compatriot of the elected chief of the confederacy —-Yuan Shao. He thought this might be of great advantage to him, so he stole away out of the camp and betrayed his master. He went to Yuan Shao's camp, informed the secret, and received a liberal reward. Yuan Shao kept the informant in his own camp.Next morning Sun Jian came to take leave, saying, ""I am rather unwell and wish to return to Changsha.""Yuan Shao laughed, saying, ""I know what you are suffering from: It is called the Imperial Hereditary Seal!""This was a shock to Sun Jian, and he paled but said, ""Whence these words?""Yuan Shao said, ""The armies were raised for the good of the state and to relieve it from oppression. The seal is state property; and since you have got hold of it, you should publicly hand it over to me as chief. When Dong Zhuo has been slain, it must go back to the government. What do you mean by concealing it and going away?""""How could the seal get into my hands?"" said Sun Jian.""Where is the article out of the well near the Hall of Paragons?""""I have it not: Why harass me thus?""""Quickly produce it, or it will be the worst for you!""Sun Jian pointing toward the heavens as an oath said, ""If I have this jewel and am hiding it myself, may my end be unhappy and my death violent!""The lords all said, ""After an oath like this, we think he cannot have it.""Then Yuan Shao called out his informant.""When you pulled that thing out of the well, was this man there?"" asked he of Sun Jian.Sun Jian's anger burst forth, and he sprang forward to kill the man.Yuan Shao also drew his sword, saying, ""You touch that soldier and it is an insult to me!""Behind Sun Jian, Generals Cheng Pu, Huang Gai, and Han Dang stepped forth; behind Yuan Shao, Generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou were ready to act. In a moment on all sides swords flew from their scabbards. But the confusion was stayed by the efforts of the others, and Sun Jian left the assembly. Soon he broke up his camp and marched to his own place.Yuan Shao was not satisfied. He wrote to Jingzhou Region and sent the letter by a trusty hand to tell Imperial Protector Liu Biao to stop Sun Jian and take away the seal."
次日，人報曹操追董卓，戰於滎陽，大敗而回。紹令人接至寨中，會眾置酒，與操解悶。飲宴間，操歎曰：「吾始興大義，為國除賊。諸公既仗義而來，操之初意，欲煩本初引河內之眾，臨孟津，酸棗；諸君固守成皋，據廒倉，塞轘轅、大谷，制其險要；公路率南陽之軍，駐丹、析，入武關，以震三輔：皆深溝高壘，勿與戰，益為疑兵，示天下形勢，以順誅逆，可立定也。今遲疑不進，大失天下之望。操竊恥之！」紹等無言可對。,"Just after this came the news of the defeat and misfortune of Cao Cao, and when he was coming home, Yuan Shao sent out to welcome him and conduct him into camp. They also prepared a feast to console him.During the feast Cao Cao said sadly, ""My object was for the public good, and all you gentlemen nobly supported me. My plan was to get Yuan Shao with his Henei troops to approach Mengching; and my force at Qiao to keep Chenggao; while the others of you to hold Suanzao, to close the passes of Huanyuan and Daigu, and to take possession of the granaries, to control the points of vantage, and thus to secure the Capital District. I planned for Yuan Shu with his Nanyang army to occupy the counties of Danshi and Xilin and go into Wu Pass to help the three support areas. All were to fortify their positions and not to fight. Advantage lay in a diverse military coalition that could show the empire a possibility of dealing with the rebellion. We could have convinced the people to side with us against Dong Zhuo. Victory would have been ours at once. But then came delays and doubts and inaction, and the confidence of the people was lost, and I am ashamed."" No reply was possible."
既而席散，操見紹等各懷異心，料不能成事，自引軍投揚州去了。公孫瓚謂玄德、關、張曰：「袁紹無能為也，久必有變。吾等且歸。」遂拔寨北行。至平原，令玄德為平原相，自去守地養軍。兗州太守劉岱，問東郡太守喬瑁借糧；瑁推辭不與，岱引軍突入瑁營，殺死喬瑁，盡降其眾。袁紹見眾人各自分散，就領兵拔寨，離洛陽，投關東去了。,"The guests dispersed. Cao Cao saw that the others mistrusted him, and in his heart knew that nothing could be accomplished. So he led off his force to Yanzhou Region.Then Gongsun Zan said to Liu Bei, ""This Yuan Shao is an incapable, and things will turns chaotic. We had better go too.""So he broke camp and went north. At Pingyuan he left Liu Bei in command and went to strengthen his own position and refresh his troops.The Imperial Protector of Yanzhou, Liu Dai, wished to borrow grain of the Governor of Dongjun, Qiao Mao. Being denied, Liu Dai attacked the camp, killed Qiao Mao and took over all his army. Yuan Shao seeing the confederacy breaking up also marched away and went east."
卻說荊州刺史劉表，字景升，山陽高平人也：乃漢室宗親；幼好結納，與名士七人為友，時號「江夏八俊」。那七人：一一汝南陳翔，字仲麟；同郡范滂，字孟博；魯國孔昱，字世元；渤海范康，字仲真；山陽檀敷，字文友；同郡張儉，字元節；南陽岑晊，字公孝。劉表與此七人為友；有延平人蒯良、蒯越，襄陽人蔡瑁為輔。當時看了袁紹書，隨令蒯越、蔡瑁引兵一萬來截孫堅。,"On the way home, Sun Jian was passing through Jingzhou Region. The Imperial Protector of Jingzhou, Liu Biao, was a scion of the imperial house and a native of Shanyang. As a young man he had made friends with many famous people, and he and his companions were called the Eight Wise Ones. The other seven were: Chen Xiang from Runan, styled Zhong Lin; Fan Pang from Runan, styled Meng Bo; Kong Yu from Luting, styled Shi Yuan; Fan Kang from Bohai, styled Zhong Zhen; Tan Fu from Shanyang, styled Wen You; Zhang Jian from Shanyang, styled Yuan Jie; and Cen Zhi from Nanyang, styled Gong Xiao.Liu Biao was friends with all seven of them. He had three famous persons who helped him in the government of his region. They were Kuai Liang and Kuai Yue from Yanping, and Cai Mao from Xiangyang.When Yuan Shao's letter detailing the fault of Sun Jian arrived, Liu Biao ordered Kuai Yue and Cai Mao with ten thousand soldiers to bar the way."
堅軍方到，蒯越將陣擺開，當先出馬。孫堅問曰：「蒯英度何故引兵截吾去路？」越曰：「汝既為漢臣，如何私匿傳國之寶？可速留下，放汝歸去！」堅大怒，命黃蓋出戰。蔡瑁舞刀來迎。鬥到數合，黃蓋揮鞭打瑁，正中護心鏡。瑁撥回馬走，孫堅乘勢殺過界口。山背後金鼓齊鳴，乃劉表親自引軍來到。孫堅就馬上施禮曰：「景升何故信袁紹之書，相逼鄰郡！」表曰：「汝匿傳國璽，將欲反耶？」堅曰：「吾若有此物，死於刀箭之下！」表曰：「汝若要我聽信，將隨軍行李，任我搜看。」堅怒曰：「汝有何力，敢小覷我！」方欲交兵，劉表便退。堅縱馬趕去，兩山後伏兵齊起，背後蒯越、蔡瑁趕來，將孫堅困在垓心。正是：玉璽得來無用處，反因此寶動刀兵。畢竟孫堅怎地脫身，且聽下文分解。,"When Sun Jian drew near, the force was arranged in fighting order and the leaders were in the front.""Why are you thus barring the road with armed troops?"" asked Sun Jian.""Why do you, a servant of Han, secrete the Emperor's special seal? Leave it with me at once and you go free,"" said Kuai Yue.Sun Jian angrily ordered out General Huang Gai. On the other side Cai Mao rode forth with his sword set to strike. But after a few bouts Huang Gai dealt Cai Mao a blow with the iron whip on the armor just over the heart. Cai Mao turned his steed and fled, and Sun Jian got through with a sudden rush.However, there arose the sound of gongs and drums on the hills behind, and there was Liu Biao in person with a large army.Sun Jian rode straight up to him and bowing low spoke, ""Why did you, on the faith of a letter from Yuan Shao, try to coerce the chief of a neighboring region?""""You have concealed the state jewel, and I want you to restore it,"" was Liu Biao's reply.""If I have this thing, may I die a violent death!""""If you want me to believe you, let me search your baggage.""""What force have you that you dare come to flout me thus?""And only Liu Biao's prompt retirement prevented a battle. Sun Jian proceeded on his way. But from the rear of the second hill an ambush suddenly discovered itself, and Kuai Yue and Cai Mao were still pursuing. Sun Jian seemed entirely hemmed in.What does a man to hold the state jewel for,If its possession lead to strife?How Sun Jian got clear of the difficulty will presently be told."
