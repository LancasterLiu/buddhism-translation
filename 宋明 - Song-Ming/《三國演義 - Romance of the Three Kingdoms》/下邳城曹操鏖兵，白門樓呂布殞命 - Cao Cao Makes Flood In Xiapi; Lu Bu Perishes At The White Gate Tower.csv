卻說高順引張遼擊關公寨，呂布自擊張飛寨，關、張各出迎戰，玄德引兵兩路接應。呂布分軍從背後殺來，關，張兩軍皆潰，玄德引數十騎奔回沛城。呂布趕來，玄德急喚城上軍士放下弔橋。呂布隨後也到。城上欲待放箭，又恐射了玄德。被呂布乘勢殺入城門，把門將士，抵敵不住，都四散奔避。呂布招軍入城。玄德見勢已急，到家不及，只得棄了妻小，穿城而過，走出西門，匹馬逃難。,"As was stated before, Gao Shun and Zhang Liao together went to smite Guan Yu, while Lu Bu attacked Zhang Fei. Both brothers went out to give battle, while Liu Bei force was held in reserve. But then Lu Bu suddenly attacked both Guan Yu and Zhang Fei from the rear, and the brothers were forced to flee. Liu Bei with a few score of horsemen rushed back to Xiaopei. As he approached the gate with Lu Bu pressing him close, he shouted to the soldiers on the wall to lower the drawbridge. Lu Bu was so close behind that the archers on the wall feared to shoot lest they should wound their lord, and so Lu Bu got into the gate. The gate guards could not force him back so they scattered in all directions. Lu Bu led his force into the city.Liu Bei saw the position was too desperate for him to reach his residence, and he must abandon all his family. So he hastened through the city and left by the west gate out at which he and his scanty following fled for very life."
呂布趕到玄德家中，糜竺出迎，告布曰：「吾聞大丈夫不廢人之妻子。今與將軍爭天下者，曹公耳。玄德常念轅門射戟之恩，不敢背將軍也。今不得已而投曹公，惟將軍憐之。」布曰：「吾與玄德舊交，豈忍害他妻子？」便令糜竺引玄德妻小，去徐州安置。布自引軍投山東兗州境上，留高順、張遼守小沛。此時孫乾已逃出城外。關、張二人亦各自收得些人馬，往山中住劄。,"When Lu Bu reached the residence, he was met by Mi Zhu who said, ""The hero does not destroy a person's family. Your rival for the empire is Cao Cao, and my master, always mindful of the good turn you did him at the Archery Feast, would not be ungrateful. But he could not help going to Cao Cao, and I think you will pity him.""Lu Bu replied, ""We two are old friends. How could I bear to harm his wives and children?""Whereupon he sent the family to Xuzhou with Mi Zhu to take care of them. Next Lu Bu led his army into Huashan Mountains to Yanzhou, leaving Gao Shun and Zhang Liao to guard Xiaopei.During these troubles Sun Qian had also fled out of the city. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, each with a handful of soldiers, had got away to the hills."
且說玄德匹馬逃難，正行間，背後一人趕至，視之乃孫乾也。玄德曰：「吾今兩弟不知存亡，妻小失散，為之奈何？」孫乾曰：「不若且投曹操，以圖後計。」玄德依言，尋小路投許都。途次絕糧，嘗往村中求食。但到處，聞劉豫州，皆爭進飲食。,"As Liu Bei with his few horsemen was making the best of their way from the scene of his defeat, he heard someone coming up behind him. When he got closer the person proved to be Sun Qian.""Alas! I know not the fate of my brothers, whether they be alive or dead, and my wife and children are lost to me! What can I do?"" said Liu Bei.Sun Qian replied, ""I see nothing better than getting away to Cao Cao, whence we may be able to plan our future moves.""Liu Bei had no better plan to propose, and the two men directed their way to Xuchang, choosing by-roads rather than highways. When their small supplies ran out, they entered a village to beg. But when the people of any place heard that Liu Bei of Yuzhou was the man who needed help, they vied with each other in offering all that was required."
一日，到一家投宿，其家一少年出拜，問其姓名，乃獵戶劉安也。當下劉安聞豫州牧至，欲尋野味供食，一時不能得，乃殺其妻以食之。玄德曰：「此何肉也？」安曰：「乃狼肉也。」玄德不疑，乃飽食了一頓，天晚就宿。至曉將去，往後院取馬，忽見一婦人殺於廚下，臂上肉已都割去。玄德驚問，方知昨夜食者，乃其妻之肉也。玄德不勝傷感。洒淚上馬。劉安告玄德曰：「本欲相隨使君，因老母在堂，未敢遠行。」,"One day they sought shelter at a house whence a youth came out and made a low obeisance. They asked his name and he gave it as Liu An, of a well known family of hunters. Hearing who the visitor was, the hunter wished to lay before him a dish of game, but though he sought for a long time, nothing could be found for the table. So Liu An came home, killed his wife and prepared a portion for his guest.While eating Liu Bei asked, ""What flesh is it?""Liu An told him: ""Wolf.""Liu Bei knew no better and ate his fill. Next day at daylight, just as Liu Bei was leaving, he went to the stables in the rear to get his horse and passing through the kitchen; he saw the dead body of a woman lying on the table. The flesh of one arm had been cut away. Quite startled he asked what this meant, and then he knew what he had eaten the night before. He was deeply sorry at this proof of his host's regard and the tears rained down as he mounted his steed at the gate.""I wish I could go with you,"" said Liu An, ""but as my mother still lives, I cannot go so far from home."""
玄德稱謝而別，取路出梁城。忽見塵頭蔽日，一彪大軍來到。玄德知是曹操之軍，同孫乾逕至中軍旗下，與曹操相見，具說失沛城，散二弟，陷妻小之事。操亦為之下淚。又說劉安殺妻為食之事，操乃令孫乾以金百兩往賜之。,"Liu Bei thanked him and went his way. The party took the road by Liangcheng, and as they were going out, they saw not far off a thick cloud of dust. When the troop came nearer, they found the troops were of Cao Cao's army, and with them they traveled to the main camp where they found Cao Cao himself. Cao Cao shed tears at the sad story of Liu Bei's distress, the loss of the city, his brothers and wives and children. When Liu Bei told him of the hunter who had sacrificed his wife to feed them, Cao Cao sent the hunter a present of a hundred ounces of silver as a reward."
軍行至濟北，夏侯淵等迎接入寨，備言兄夏侯惇損其一目，臥病未痊。操臨臥處視之，令先回許都調理；一面使人打探呂布現在何處。採馬回報云：「呂布與陳宮，臧霸結連泰山賊寇，共攻兗州諸郡。」操即令曹仁引三千兵打沛城。操親提大軍，與玄德來戰呂布。前至山東，路近蕭關，正遇泰山寇孫觀，吳敦，尹禮，昌豨，領兵三萬餘攔去路。操令許褚迎戰，四將一齊出馬。許褚奮力死戰，四將抵敵不住，各自敗走。操乘勢掩殺，追至蕭關，探馬飛報呂布。,"The march then was continued to Jibei, where Xiahou Yuan welcomed them. They heard that his brother Xiahou Dun was still ill from the wound he had received in the eye. Cao Cao went to the sick man's bedside to see him and had him removed to Xuchang for skilled treatment.Presently scouts, sent out particularly for tidings of Lu Bu, returned, saying, ""Lu Bu has allied himself with the bandits in the east, and they are attacking Yanzhou.""At this Cao Cao dispatched Cao Ren with three thousand soldiers to take Xiaopei, while he, in conjunction with Liu Bei, moved against Lu Bu.They went east. As they reached the Mangdang Hills near Xiao Pass, they met the a band of thirty thousand Taishan Mountains brigands barring their road. The chieftains of the bandits were Sun Guan, Wu Dun, Yin Li, and Chang Xi who rode out with their spears set. However, Xu Chu plunged into the battle and easily beat them back and chased them right up to the pass. The scouts told Lu Bu."
時布已回徐州，欲同陳登往救小沛，令陳珪守徐州，陳登臨行，珪謂之曰：「昔曹公曾言東方事盡付與汝。今布將敗，可便圖之。」登曰：「外面之事，兒自為之；倘布敗回，父親便請糜竺一同守城，休放布入，兒自布脫身之計。」珪曰：「布妻小在，此心腹頗多，為之奈何？」登曰：「兒亦有計了。」乃入見呂布曰：「徐州四面受敵，操必力攻，我當先思退步。可將錢糧移於下邳，倘徐州被圍，下邳有糧可救。主公盍早為計！」布曰：「元龍之言甚善。吾當并妻小移去。」遂令宋憲，魏續保護妻小與錢糧移屯下邳；一面自引軍與陳登住救蕭關。到半路，登曰：「容某先到關探曹兵虛實，主公方可行。」,"Lu Bu was then in Xuzhou, whither he had gone to start an expedition to save Xiaopei. He left the protection of Xuzhou to Chen Gui and set out with Chen Deng.As Chen Deng was starting, Chen Gui said to him, ""Remember the words of Cao Cao, that the business of the east is in our hands. Now is our moment, for Lu Bu is about to suffer defeat.""""Father, I can look after the outside. But when Lu Bu returns beaten, you must arrange with Mi Zhu to keep him out of the city. I shall find a means of escape,"" said Chen Deng.""His family is here, and he has many friends. How about them?""""I also have a scheme to settle them.""Then Chen Deng went to see Lu Bu, to whom he said, ""Xuzhou is surrounded, and this city will be fiercely attacked. We ought to provide for possible retreat, and I advise storing grain and money in Xiapi. We could retreat there if the day went adversely. Why not see about this in good time?""""Your words are indeed wise. I will also send my wives and little ones thither,"" said Lu Bu.The family left under escort of Wei Xu and Song Xian, and with them was sent much grain and treasures and coins.And then the soldiers marched to the relief of the pass. About half way there Chen Deng said, ""Let me go first to reconnoiter so that you, my lord, may advance with confidence."""
布許之，登乃先到關上。陳宮等接見。登曰：「溫侯深怪公等不肯向前，要來責罰。」宮曰：「今曹兵勢大，未可輕敵。吾等緊守關隘，可勸主公深保沛城，乃為上策。」陳登唯唯。至晚上關而望，見曹兵直逼關下，乃乘夜連寫三封書，拴在箭上，射下關去。次日辭了陳宮，飛馬來見呂布曰：「關上孫觀等皆欲獻關，某已留下陳宮守把，將軍可於黃昏時殺去救應。」,"Thus Chen Deng parted company with his chief and preceded him to the pass where he was received by Chen Gong.Chen Deng said, ""The General greatly wonders why you do not advance. He is going to inquire into it.""""The enemy is in great force, and we cannot be too careful,"" said Chen Gong. ""We are holding the pass, and you should persuade our master to take steps to guard Xiaopei.""Chen Deng said, ""Your words are true.""That evening he went up to the heights from which he could see Cao Cao's army, which was quite close to the pass. Then he wrote three notes, tied them to arrows, and shot them into Cao Cao's camp.Next day he left and hastened back to Lu Bu and said, ""Those bandits are about to give up the pass to the enemy, but I have left Chen Gong to hold it. You had better make an attack tonight and hold him."""
布曰：「非公則此關休矣。」便教陳登飛騎先至關，約陳宮為內應，舉火為號。登逕往報宮曰：「曹兵已抄小路到關內，恐徐州有失。公等宜急回。」宮遂引眾棄關而走。登就關上放起火來。呂布乘黑殺至，陳宮軍和呂布軍在黑暗裏自相掩殺。,"""Had it not been for you, the pass would have been lost,"" said Lu Bu.Then he sent Chen Deng back to arrange a fire signal with Chen Gong for simultaneous action.So Chen Deng returned to Chen Gong to whom he said, ""Cao Cao's troops have found a secret way through the pass, and I fear Xuzhou is already lost. You ought to go back at once.""At this the pass was abandoned, and Chen Gong began to retreat. Then Chen Deng gave the prearranged signal.Lu Bu saw the fire and advanced in the darkness to the relief of the pass. Presently he met Chen Gong's army; and as neither recognized the other in the darkness, a fierce battle ensued. Nor was the trick discovered till daylight came."
曹兵望見號火，一齊殺到，乘勢攻擊。孫觀等各自四散逃避去了。呂布直殺到天明，方知是計；急與陳宮回徐州。到得城邊叫門時，城上亂箭射下。糜竺在敵樓上喝曰：「汝奪吾主城池，今當仍還吾主，汝不得復入此城也。」布大怒曰：「陳珪何在？」竺曰：「吾已殺之矣。」布回顧宮曰：「陳登安在？」宮曰：「將軍尚執迷而問此佞賊乎？」,"While these things were going on, Cao Cao had noted the signal and advanced as fast as possible. The bandits, who alone remained to hold the pass, were easily driven out and scattered in all directions.When daylight came and the trick was discovered, Lu Bu and Chen Gong set off together for Xuzhou. But when they arrived and summoned the gate, instead of opening the doors, the guards on the wall saluted them with a thick flight of arrows.At the same time Mi Zhu appeared on the defense tower and shouted, ""You stole our master's city, and now we are going to give it back to him. You will not enter here again!""""Where is Chen Gui?"" cried Lu Bu, angrily.""We have slain him!"" was the reply.""Where is Chen Deng?"" said Lu Bu turning to Chen Gong.""Do you still hold to your delusion, General, that you ask where this specious rogue is?"""
布令遍尋軍中，卻只不見。宮勸布急投小沛，布從之。行至半路，只見一彪軍驟至，視之乃高順，張遼也。布問之，答曰：「陳登來報說主公被圍，今某等急來救解。」宮曰：「此又佞賊之計也。」布怒曰：「吾必殺此賊！」急驅馬至小沛。只見城上盡插曹兵旗號。原來曹操已令曹仁襲了城池，引軍守把。呂布於城下大罵陳登。登在城上指布罵曰：「吾乃漢臣，安肯事汝反賊耶！」布大怒。正待攻城，忽聽背後喊聲大起，一隊人馬來到。當先一將乃是張飛。高順出馬迎敵，不能取勝。布親自接戰。正鬥間，陣外喊聲復起，曹操親統大軍衝殺前來。,"Lu Bu bade them search through all the ranks, but Chen Deng was not to be found. Then they decided to go to Xiaopei. But ere they had got half way there, suddenly appeared the troops under the command of Gao Shun and Zhang Liao.They said, ""Chen Deng came to us saying you, General, was surrounded and wanted help, so we came at once.""""Another trick of that false rogue!"" said Lu Bu. ""Surely he shall die for this.""They went with all speed to Xiaopei, only to see as they drew near, the ensigns of the enemy displayed all along the walls, for the city had been taken by Cao Ren.While Lu Bu stood at the foot of the rampart reviling the traitor, Chen Deng himself appeared on the wall and pointing to Lu Bu cried, ""Did you think that I, a minister of the dynasty, would serve a rebel like you?""Lu Bu in his wrath was about to make a desperate attack, but suddenly a great noise was heard, and an army came up behind him. It was led by no other than Zhang Fei. Gao Shun went to engage him, but he had no chance of success. Lu Bu then joined in the fray. Then another army appeared, and the leader this time was Cao Cao himself, and his army rushed to the attack."
布料難抵敵，引軍東走。曹兵隨後追趕。呂布走得人困馬乏。忽大閃出一彪軍攔住去路，為道一將，立馬橫刀，大喝：「呂布休走！關雲長在此！」呂布慌忙接戰。背後張飛趕來。布無心戀戰，與陳宮等殺開條路，逕奔下邳。侯成引兵接應去了。關、張相見，各洒淚言失散之事。雲長曰：「我在海州路上住紮，探得消息，故來至此。」張飛曰：「弟在芒碭山住了這幾時，今日幸得相遇。」,"Seeing that he had no hope of victory, Lu Bu went away toward the east, with Cao Cao in pursuit. Lu Bu's army marched till they were worn out.Then appeared a new force under Guan Yu. Holding his sword ready to strike, Guan Yu called out, ""Do not flee, O Lu Bu! Guan Yu is waiting for you.""Lu Bu joined battle. He was flurried and scarcely knew what was happening. And soon Zhang Fei came up once more. By desperate efforts Lu Bu and his troops cut an alley through the press and got free. After this they started for Xiapi as fast as they could travel, and Hou Cheng helped to keep the pursuers at bay and welcomed them into the city.So the two brothers, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, were together again after their separation. Both shed tears of joy as they told each other what they had seen and suffered.""I was on the Haizhou Road when I heard of you,"" said Guan Yu. ""I lost no time in starting.""""And I had been camped in the Mangdang Hills for a long time. It is happiness to be together again."""
兩個敘話畢，一同引兵來見玄德，哭拜於地。玄德悲喜交集，引二人見曹操，便隨操入徐州。糜竺接見，具言家屬無恙，玄德甚喜。陳珪父子亦來參拜曹操。操設一大宴，犒勞諸將。操自居中，使陳珪居左、玄德居右。其餘將士，各依次坐。宴罷，操嘉陳珪父子之功，加封十縣祿，授登為伏波將軍。,"So they talked. Then they marched off together to find their elder brother, and made their salutations with tears. In Liu Bei's heart, sadness and joy intermingled. Next they were presented to Cao Cao, and with him they went into the captured Xuzhou City.Mi Zhu soon came with the welcome news of the safety of the family. And Chen Gui and Chen Deng came to present their salutations. A grand banquet was prepared for the officers at which Cao Cao presided as host, and Chen Gui and Liu Bei occupied the seats of honor to his right and left. At the close of the banquet, Cao Cao paid the two Chens the highest compliments on their success and rewarded them with the revenues of ten counties beside giving the son the title of General Who Quells the Waves."
且說曹操得了徐州，心中大喜，商議起兵攻下邳。程昱曰：「布今止有下邳一城，若逼之太急，必死戰而投袁術矣。布與術合，其勢難攻。今可使能事者守住淮南徑路，內防呂布，外當袁術。況今山東尚有臧霸、孫觀之徒未曾歸順，防之亦不可忽也。」,"Cao Cao was very pleased with his success and at once began to scheme for the taking of Xiapi, the sole place now left to Lu Bu, where he had taken refuge.Cheng Yu said the course was inadvisable.""If Lu Bu be pressed too hard, he may get clear by a desperate effort and throw himself into the arms of our especial enemy, Yuan Shu. These two as allies would be difficult to overcome. Rather send a capable man to guard the South of River Huai, one able to secure you against Lu Bu on one hand and to hold Yuan Shu on the other. Moreover the bandits are in Huashan Mountains and still our enemies. They must be watched."""
操曰：「吾自當山東諸路。其淮南徑路請玄德當之。」玄德曰：「丞相將令，安敢有違？」次日，玄德留糜竺、簡雍在徐州，帶孫乾，關，張引軍往守淮南徑路。曹操自引兵攻下邳。,"Cao Cao replied, ""I can keep the whole of Huashan Mountains, and I will request Liu Bei to take the south.""""Could I dare withstand your command?"" said Liu Bei.So forthwith Liu Bei, leaving Mi Zhu and Jian Yong at Xuzhou, went south, taking in his train Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Sun Qian. And Cao Cao led his army to Xiapi."
且說呂布在下邳，自恃糧食足備，且有泗水之險，安心坐守，何保無虞。陳宮曰：「今操兵方來，可乘其寨柵未定，以逸擊勞，無不勝者。」布曰：「吾方屢敗，不可輕出。待其來攻而後擊之，皆落泗水矣。」遂不聽陳宮之言。,"Lu Bu felt very secure in his refuge. He had good store of grain, and he had the protection of River Si, so he sat quiet, satisfied that he could maintain his defense. So he allowed Cao Cao's army to approach without molestation.""You ought to attack Cao Cao's army as they come up, before they have time to make camps and defenses. They will only have a fatigued army to oppose to your fresh troops, and you will certainly defeat them.""So said Chen Gong, but Lu Bu replied, ""I have suffered too many defeats lately to take any risk. Wait till they actually attack, and you will see them floating away on the waters."" So Lu Bu neglected the confidant's advice."
過數日，曹兵下寨已定。操統眾將至城下，大叫呂布答話。布上城而立。操謂布曰：「聞奉先又欲結婚袁術，吾故領兵至此。夫術有反逆大非，而公有討董卓之功，今何自棄其前功而從逆賊耶？倘城池一破，悔之晚矣！若早來降，共扶王室，當不失封侯之位。」布曰：「丞相且退，尚容商議。」,"Lu Bu waited till the enemy had settled into their camp. This done, the attackers advanced against the city. From the foot of the wall, Cao Cao called to Lu Bu to listen while he spoke. Lu Bu ascended to the wall where he stood.Cao Cao addressed him, saying, ""When I heard that your family and that of Yuan Shu were likely to be united by marriage, I sent an army against you. Yuan Shu was guilty of treason, while you had to your credit on the destruction of Dong Zhuo. For what reason have you sacrificed all your merits to throw in your lot with a rebel? It will be over late to regret when this city shall have fallen. But if you surrender and help me to support the ruling house, you shall not lose your rank.""Lu Bu replied, ""If the Prime Minister will retire, we may be able to discuss the matter."""
陳宮在布側大罵曹操奸賊，一箭射中其麾蓋。操指宮恨曰：「吾誓殺汝！」遂引兵攻城。宮謂布曰：「曹操遠來，勢不能久。將軍可以步騎出屯於外，宮將餘眾閉守於內。操若攻將軍，宮引兵擊其背；若來攻城，將軍為救於後。不過旬日，操軍食盡，可一鼓而破，此乃掎角之勢也。」布曰：「公言極是。」遂歸府收拾戎裝。時方冬寨，分付從人多帶綿衣。,"But Chen Gong, standing near his master, began to rail at Cao Cao for a rebel and shot an arrow that struck his plumed helmet.""My oath, but I will slay you at least!"" cried Cao Cao, pointing his finger at Chen Gong.Then the attack on the walls began.""They have come from far and cannot maintain this for long,"" said Chen Gong. ""General, go out with your horse and foot and take up a position outside, leaving me to maintain the defense with the remainder of our troops. If he engages you, I will come out and strike at his rear ranks; if he attacks the city, you can come to our aid. In ten days their stores will fail, and we can beat them off. This will place them between the ox-horns.""""The advice seems good,"" said Lu Bu.Lu Bu went back to his palace and prepared his weapons. As it was the depth of winter, he made his army take plenty of wadded clothing to keep them warm."
布妻嚴氏聞之，出問曰：「君欲何往？」布告以陳宮之謀。嚴氏曰：「君委全城，捐妻子，孤軍遠出，倘一旦有變，妾豈得為將軍之妻乎？」布躊躇未決，三日不出。宮入見曰：「操軍四面圍城，若不早出，必受其困。」布曰：「吾思遠出不如堅守。」宮曰：「近聞操軍糧少，遣人往許都去取，早晚將至。將軍可引精兵往斷其糧道。此計大妙。」,"Lady Yan, Lu Bu's wife, heard of it and came to ask whither he was going. He told her of Chen Gong's plan.She said, ""My lord, you are leaving an undamaged city, abandoning your wife and little ones, and going with a paltry force. Should any untoward event happen, will your handmaid and her lord ever meet again?""Lu Bu hesitated and for three days made no move.Then Chen Gong came to see him again and said, ""The enemy are all round the city; and unless you go out soon, you will be quite hemmed in.""""I am thinking it would be better to maintain a stubborn defense,"" said Lu Bu.""Our enemies are short of food and have sent for supplies to Xuchang. These will soon arrive, and you should go out with some veterans and intercept the convoy. That loss would be a heavy blow."""
布然其言，復入內對嚴氏說知此事。嚴氏泣曰：「將軍若出，陳宮，高順，安能堅守城池？倘有差失，悔無及矣！妾昔在長安，已為將軍所棄，幸賴龐舒私藏妾身，再得與將軍相聚；孰佑知今又棄妾而去乎？將軍前程萬里，請勿以妾為念！」言罷痛哭。,"Lu Bu agreed and went in to tell his wife the new plan.She wept saying, ""If you go, do you think Chen Gong and others equal to the defense of the city? Should anything go wrong, you would be very sorry. You abandoned me at Changan, and it was only through the fortunate kindness of Pang Shu that I was hidden from our enemies and rejoined you. Who would have thought you would leave me again? But go, go your way as far as you wish, and do not mind your wife.""And she wept bitterly."
布聞言愁悶不決，入告貂蟬。貂蟬曰：「將軍與妾作主，勿輕騎自出。」布曰：「汝無憂慮。吾有畫戟，赤兔馬，誰敢近我？」乃出謂陳宮曰：「操軍糧至者，詐也。操多詭計，吾未敢動。」宮出歎曰：「吾等死無葬身之地矣！」,"Lu Bu very sadly went to take leave of Diao Chan who said, ""You are my lord and my life. You must not be careless and ride out alone.""""You need not fear. With my mighty trident halberd and Red Hare, who dare come near me?""He went out. But when he met Chen Gong, he said, ""That story about supplies for Cao Cao is all false, one of his many ruses. I am not going to stir.""Chen Gong sighed. He felt all was lost.""We shall die, and no one shall know our burial place,"" said he."
布於是終日不出，只同嚴氏，貂蟬飲酒解悶。謀士許汜，王楷入見布，進計曰：「今袁術在淮南，聲勢大振。將軍舊曾與彼約婚，今何不仍求之？彼兵若至，內外夾攻，操不難破也。」布從其計，即日修書，就著二人前去。許汜曰：「須得一軍引路衝出方好。」布令張遼，郝萌兩個引兵一千，送出隘口。,"Thereupon Lu Bu remained in his own quarters with his ladies, drinking freely to dissipate his sorrows.Two of his advisers, Xu Si and Wang Kai, went in and proposed, ""Yuan Shu in the South of River Huai is very powerful. Why not write to him to renew the marriage alliance? Yuan Shu can hardly refuse to rescue the affianced bride of his son.""So Lu Bu wrote and bade these two take the letter.Xu Si said, ""You ought to send a strong escort with us to force a way through.""So Lu Bu told off one thousand troops and two of his generals, Zhang Liao and He Meng, to conduct his messenger beyond the pass."
是夜二更，張遼在前，郝萌在後，保著許汜，王楷殺出城去。抹過玄德寨，眾將追趕不及，已出隘口。郝萌將五百人，跟許汜，王楷而去。張遼引一半軍回來，到隘口時，雲長攔住。未及交鋒，高順引兵出城救應，接入城中去了。,"They started that same night at the second watch, Zhang Liao leading and He Meng bringing up the rear. They got out of the city, crept past Liu Bei's camp, and got beyond the danger zone. Then half the escort went on, and Zhang Liao led the remainder back toward the city. At the pass he found Guan Yu waiting. However, at that moment Gao Shun came to his help, and they all returned and reentered the gates."
且說許汜，王楷至壽春，拜見袁術，呈上書信。術曰：「前者殺吾使命，賴我奼姻，今又來相問，何也？」汜曰：「此為曲奸計所誤：願明公詳之。」術曰：「汝主不因曹兵困急，豈肯以女許我？」楷曰：「明公今不相救，恐脣亡齒寒，亦非明公之福也。」術曰：「奉先反覆無信，可先送女，然後發兵。」許汜，王楷只得拜辭，和郝萌回來。到亡德寨邊，汜曰：「日間不可過。夜半吾二人先行，郝將軍斷後。」,"The two messengers presently reached Shouchun, saw Yuan Shu, and presented the letter.""How is this?"" said Yuan Shu. ""Formerly he slew my messenger and repudiated the marriage. Now he sends to ask for it.""""It is all due to the vile plans of that monster Cao Cao. If pray you, Illustrious Sir, consider it carefully,"" replied Xu Si.""But if your master was not hemmed in by his enemy and in imminent danger, he would never have thought of renewing this proposal of marriage.""The messengers said, ""You may decide not to help him, but the teeth are cold when the lips are gone. It will not make for your happiness and comfort.""Said Yuan Shu, ""Lu Bu is unreliable. Tell him that I will send soldiers after the girl has arrived here.""This was final, and the two messengers took leave and headed back to Xiapi.When the party reached Liu Bei's camp, Xu Si decided, ""We must wait the night falls, and Wang Kai and I will try to get through in the darkness. The escort of He Meng remaining behind to protect our rear."""
商量停當。夜過玄德寨，許汜，王楷先過去了。郝萌正行之次，張飛出寨攔路。郝萌交馬只一合，被張飛生擒過去，五百人馬盡被殺散。張飛解郝萌來見玄德，玄德押往大寨見曹操。郝萌備說求救許婚一事。操大怒，斬郝萌於軍門，使人傳諭各寨，小心防守，如有走透呂布及彼軍士者，依軍法處治。各寨悚然。,"They tried that very night, and the two messengers crept across without discovery. But the escort found themselves faced by Zhang Fei. He Meng tried to fight but was captured in the very first bout, and the five hundred troops of his half company were either killed or they fled.The prisoner was taken to Liu Bei, who forwarded him to the main camp. There he told the story of the marriage and the scheme to save the city. Cao Cao was angry and ordered the execution of He Meng at the main gate.Then Cao Cao sent orders to each camp to exercise the greatest diligence with threats of rigorous punishment of the officers of any corps that permitted any communication between the besieged and the outer world.Every soldier felt mightily afraid."
玄德回營，分付關、張曰：「我等正當淮南衝要之處。二弟切宜小心在意，勿犯曹公軍令。」飛曰：「捉了一員賊將，曹操不見有甚褒賞，卻反來諕嚇，何也？」玄德曰：「非也：曹操統領多軍，不以軍令，何能服人？弟勿犯之。」關，張應諾而退。,"Liu Bei returned to camp and cautioned his brothers, saying, ""We are in the most important place with regard to the South of River Huai, and you must be very careful not to allow any breach of this command.""Zhang Fei was inclined to grumble, saying, ""We have just captured one of the enemy's leaders, and there is no word of praise or reward for us: Nothing but new orders and threats. What do you make of that?""""You are wrong to complain,"" said Liu Bei. ""These are orders of the Commander-in-Chief, and what would happen were there no orders? Do not disobey them, brother.""They promised obedience and withdrew."
且說許汜，王楷，回見呂布，具言袁術先欲得婦，然後起兵救援。布曰：「如何送去？」汜曰：「今郝萌被獲，操必知我情，預作準備。若非將軍親自護送，誰能突出重圍？」布曰：「今日便送去，如何？」汜曰：「今日乃凶神值日，不可去。明日大利，宜用戌亥時。」布命張遼，高順引三千軍馬，安排小車一輛：「我親送至二百里外，卻使你兩個送去。」,"In the meantime Xu Si and Wang Kai had got back to Lu Bu and told him what Yuan Shu had said, that if the girl came the soldiers should go.""But how can she be sent?"" said Lu Bu.Xu Si said, ""That is the difficulty. He Meng's capture means that Cao Cao knows the whole plan of getting help from the South of River Huai. I do not see how anyone but you yourself could hope to get through the close siege.""""Suppose we tried, today?"" said Lu Bu.""This is an ill-omened day. You must not try today. Tomorrow is a very lucky day, especially in the evening, for any military action.""Then Lu Bu ordered Zhang Liao and Gao Shun, ""Get ready three thousand troops for the venture, and prepare a light carriage. I will lead the first seventy miles, thence you can escort the bride-elect the remainder of the way to her new home."""
次夜二更時分，呂布將女以綿纏身，用甲包裏，負於背上，提戟上馬。放開城門，布當先出城，張遼，高順跟著。將次到玄德寨前，一聲鼓響，關，張二人攔住去路，大叫：「休走！」布無心戀戰，只顧奪路而行。玄德自引一軍殺來，兩軍混戰。呂布雖勇，終是縛一女在身上，只恐有傷，不敢衝突重圍。後面徐晃、許褚皆殺來，眾軍皆大叫曰：「不要走了呂布！」,"Next evening toward the second watch, Lu Bu wrapped up his daughter in soft wadded garments, bound her about with a mailed coat, and took her on his back. Then with his mighty trident halberd in hand, he mounted Red Hare and rode at the head of the cavalcade out of the city gate. Zhang Liao and Gao Shun followed.In this order they approached Liu Bei's camp. The drums at once beat the alarm, and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei barred the way.""Stop!"" they shouted.Lu Bu had no desire to fight; all he wished was to get through, so he made for a side road. Liu Bei came in pursuit and the two parties engaged. Brave as he might be, Lu Bu was almost helpless now that he was hampered by a girl on his shoulders, whom he was desperately anxious to preserve from hurt. Beside other parties came up all shouting and attacking."
布見軍來太急，只得仍退入城。玄德收軍，徐晃等各歸寨，端的不曾走透一個。呂布回到城中，心中憂悶，只是飲酒。,Lu Bu had no alternative but to give up his project and return into the city of Xiapi. He reached his palace very sad at heart. The besiegers returned to camp well pleased that no one had got beyond their lines. Lu Bu found consolation in the wine cup.
卻說曹操攻城，兩月不下，忽報：「河內太守張揚出兵東市，欲救呂布；部將楊醜殺之，欲將頭獻丞相，欲被張揚心腹將眭固所殺，反投大城去了。」操聞報，即遣史渙追斬眭固。因聚眾將曰：「張揚雖幸自滅，然北有袁紹之憂，東有表、繡之患，下邳久圍不克。吾欲捨布還都，暫且息戰，何如？」荀攸急止曰：「不可，呂布屢敗，銳氣已墮。軍以將為主，將衰則軍無戰心。彼陳宮雖有謀而遲，今布之氣未復，宮之謀未定，作速政之，布可擒也。」郭嘉曰：「某有一計，下邳城可立破，勝於二十萬師。」荀彧曰：「莫非決沂、泗之水乎？」嘉笑曰：「正是此意。」,"The siege had gone on for two months, and still the city stood. Then they heard that Zhang Yang, Governor of Henei, had been inclined to come to the help of Lu Bu. But one of his subordinates, Yang Chou, had assassinated him and was bringing his head as an offering to Cao Cao, when Yang Chou had also been slain by Kui Gu, one of the Governor's adherents. Kui Gu had then led the force to Daicheng.In the camp of the besiegers, there now arose much murmuring. Cao Cao sent Shi Huan to intercept and kill Kui Gu.Then he called a counsel, saying, ""Though Zhang Yang, who meant to hurt us, is happily no more, yet we are threatened on the north by Yuan Shao, and on the west Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu are a menace. Here we meet with no success against the city of Xiapi. We are for leaving Lu Bu to his fate and returning home. What do you think?""Among them Xun You fought against the idea, saying, ""You must not act like this. Lu Bu has lost much, and his spirit is broken. The spirit of the leader expresses that of his army; and when the leader fails, his soldiers do not fight. Chen Gong is clever, but nothing is done. Lu Bu broken, Chen Gong without decision, it only needs a sharp attack, and we shall succeed.""""I have a plan to propose,"" said Guo Jia, ""a plan to overcome the city at once. It is better than two hundred thousand troops.""""I suppose you mean drowning the city by River Si and River Yi,"" said Xun Yu.""That is it,"" said Guo Jia, smiling."
操大喜。即令軍士決兩河之水。曹兵皆居高原，坐視水淹下邳。下邳一城，只剩得東門無水；其餘各門，都被水淹。眾軍飛報呂布。布曰：「吾有亦免馬，渡水如平地，又何懼哉！」乃日與妻妾痛飲美酒。因酒色過傷，形容銷減。一旦取鏡自照，驚曰：「吾被酒色傷矣！自今日始，當戒之。」遂下令城中，但有飲酒皆斬。,"Cao Cao accepted the suggestion with joy and set his troops to cut the banks of River Yi and River Si, and moved his army to the high ground whence they watched the drowning out of Xiapi. Only the east gate remained clear of water.The besieged soldiers hastened to their leader.Lu Bu said, ""Why should I fear? My good horse can go as well through the water as over the land.""And he again returned to the wine cup for consolation, drinking deeply with his wife and concubine.The continual drinking bouts told at last, and Lu Bu began to look dissipated. Seeing himself in a mirror one day, he was startled at the change and said to himself, ""I am injuring myself with wine. No more from this day forward!""He then issued an order that no one should drink wine under penalty of death."
卻說侯成有馬十五匹，被後槽人盜去，欲獻與玄德。侯成知覺，追殺後槽人，將馬奪回；諸將與侯成作賀。侯成釀得五六斛酒，欲與諸將會飲；恐呂布見罪，乃先以酒五瓶詣布府，稟曰：「托將軍虎威，追得失馬。眾將皆來作賀，釀得些酒，未敢擅飲，特先奉上微意。」,"Now one of his generals, Hou Cheng, lost fifteen horses, stolen by one of his subordinates, Hou Cao, who intended to resell them to Liu Bei. Hou Cheng found out where the horses were, went out after them, and recovered them after killing Hou Cao. And Hou Cheng's colleagues congratulated him on his success. To celebrate the occasion, Hou Cheng brewed a few barrels of wine to be drunk at the feast.But thinking his chief might find him in fault, Hou Cheng sent the bottles of wine to Lu Bu's palace with a petition explaining, ""By your virtue of warlike renown, I have recovered my horses; and as my comrades come with their congratulations, I brew some bottles of wine, first to offer Your Lordship and second to ask your permission to have a little wine at the feast."""
布大怒曰：「吾方禁酒，汝卻釀酒會飲，莫非同謀伐我乎？」命推出斬之。宋憲，魏續等諸將俱入告饒。布曰：「故犯吾令，理合斬首。今看眾將面，且打一百！」眾將又哀告，打了五十背花，然後放歸。眾將無不喪氣。,"Lu Bu took it very angrily, saying, ""When I have forbidden all wine, you brew some and begin to give feasts: You are simply defying me!""Whereupon he ordered the officer to instant execution. However, Song Xian, Wei Xu, and other officers came in and interceded, and after a time Lu Bu softened.""You ought to lose your head for this disobedience. But for the sake of your colleagues, the punishment shall be reduced to a hundred strokes.""They tried to beg him off this, but only succeeded in reducing the number of blows to one half.When the sentence had been carried out and Hou Cheng was permitted to return home, his colleagues came sadly to console him."
宋憲，魏續至侯成家探視，侯成泣曰：「非公等則吾死矣！」憲曰：「布只戀妻子，視吾等如草芥。」續曰：「軍圍城下，水遶壕邊，吾等死無日矣！」憲曰：「布無仁無義，我等棄之而走，何如？」續曰：「非丈夫也。不若擒布獻曹公。」侯成曰：「我因追馬受責，而布所倚恃者，赤免馬也。汝二人果能獻門擒布，吾當先盜馬去見曹公。」,"""Had it not been for you, I should have been put to death,"" said Hou Cheng.Song Xian replied, ""All Lu Bu cares for is his family. There is no pity for anyone else. We are no more than the weeds by the roadside.""Wei Xu said, ""The city is besieged; the water is drowning us out. There will not be much more of this, for we may die any day.""""He is a beast, with neither a sense of humanity nor of right. Let us leave him,"" said Song Xian.""He is not worth fighting for. The best we could do would be to seize him and hand him over to Cao Cao,"" said Wei Xu.""I was punished because I got my horses back again, yet all he trusts in is his own Red Hare. If you two will betray the gate and seize Lu Bu, I will steal the horse and go out to Cao Cao's camp."""
三人商議定了。是夜侯成暗至馬院，盜了那匹赤免馬，飛奔東門來。魏續便開門放出，卻佯作追趕之狀。侯成到曹操寨，獻上馬匹，備言宋憲、魏續插白旗為號，準備獻門。曹操聞此信，便押榜數十張射入城去。其榜曰：,"They settled how to carry out the plot, and that very night Hou Cheng sneaked into the stables and got Red Hare away. He hastened to the east gate which was opened to let him through. The guard made a pretense of pursuing him but only a pretense.Hou Cheng reached the besiegers' camp, presented the horse and told Cao Cao what had been arranged. They would show a white flag and open the gates to his army. Hearing this Cao Cao had a few notifications written out, which were attached to arrows and shot over the walls. This is one of them:"
大將軍曹，特奉明詔，征伐呂布。如有抗拒大軍者，破城之日，滿門誅戳。上至將校，下至庶民，有能擒呂布來獻，或獻其首級者，重加官賞。為此榜諭，各宜知悉。,"""Regent Marshal Cao Cao has received a command from the Emperor to destroy Lu Bu. Those who interfere with the operations of his grand army, whatever their rank, shall be put to death in the gate on the day that the city shall be captured. Should anyone capture Lu Bu or bring his head, he shall be well rewarded. Let all take note of this."""
次日平明，城外喊聲震地。呂布大驚，提戟上城，各門點視，責罵魏續走透侯成，失了戰馬，欲待治罪。城下曹兵望見城上白旗，竭力攻城，布只得親自抵敵。從平明直打到日中，曹兵稍退。布少憩門樓，不覺睡著在椅上。宋憲趕退左右，先盜其畫戟，便與魏續一齊動手，將呂布繩纏索綁，緊緊縛住。,"Next day at daylight a tremendous hubbub was heard without the city and Lu Bu, halberd in hand, hasted to the wall to see what it meant. As he went from gate to gate inspecting the defenses and guards, he censured Wei Xu for letting Hou Cheng escape and get away with his horse. Lu Bu threatened to punish Wei Xu. But just then the besiegers began a fierce attack as the white flag had just appeared, and Lu Bu had to turn all his energies to defense. The assault lasted till noon, when the attacking force drew off for a time.Lu Bu was taking a rest in the tower and fell asleep in his chair. Song Xian sent away Lu Bu's attendants. When they had gone, he stole Lu Bu's weapon, the trident halberd in which he trusted. Then Song Xian and Wei Xu fell upon Lu Bu together and before he was well awake had bound him with cords, trussing him so that he could not move."
布從睡夢中驚醒，急喚左右，卻都被二人殺散，把白旗一招，曹兵齊至城下。魏續大叫：「已生擒呂布矣！」夏侯淵尚未信。宋憲在擲下呂布畫戟來，大開城門，曹兵一擁而入。高順，張遼在西門，水圍難出。為曹兵所擒。陳宮奔至南門，為徐晃所獲。,"Lu Bu shouted for his guards, but they were driven off by the two traitor generals and could not come near. Then a white flag was shown, and the besiegers again approached the city.The traitors shouted out, ""Lu Bu has been captured alive!""But Xiahou Yuan could hardly believe it till they threw down the famous halberd. The gates were flung open, and the enemy entered the city. Gao Shun and Zhang Liao, who were at the opposite gate, were surrounded and cut off by the water and helpless. They were captured. Chen Gong made a dash to the south gate but was also taken by Xu Huang."
曹操入城，即傳令退了所決之水，出榜安民；一面與玄德同坐白門樓上，關，張侍立於側，提過擒獲一干人來。呂布雖然長大，卻被繩索綑作一團。布叫曰：「縛太急，乞緩之！」操曰：「縛虎不得不急。」布見侯成，魏續[陳怡妏1]，宋憲，皆立於側，乃謂之曰：「我待諸將不薄，汝等何忍背反？」憲曰：「聽妻妾言，不聽將計，何謂不薄？」,"Presently Cao Cao entered and at once gave orders to turn the streams back into their usual courses. He put out proclamations to sooth the people.Cao Cao and Liu Bei, with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei behind, seated themselves side by side in the White Gate Tower. The captives were brought before them. Lu Bu looked a pitiable object. Although a very tall man, he was tied up in a veritable ball.""The bonds are very tight,"" cried he, ""I beseech you to loosen them!""""Binding a tiger must bind tight, of course,"" replied Cao Cao.Seeing Hou Cheng, Song Xian, and Wei Xu standing there looking pleased at their success, Lu Bu said, ""I treated you all well enough: How could you turn against me?""Said Song Xian, ""You listened to the words of your women, but rejected the advice of your generals. Was not that mean?"""
布默然。須臾，眾擁高順至。操問曰：「汝有何言？」順不答。操怒命斬之。徐晃解陳宮至。操曰：「公臺別來無恙？」宮曰：「汝心術不正，吾故棄汝！」操曰：「吾心不正，公又奈何獨事呂布？」宮曰：「布雖無謀，不似你詭詐奸險。」操曰：「公自謂足智多謀，今竟何如？」宮顧呂布曰：「恨此人不從吾言！若從吾言，未必被擒也。」操曰：「今日之事當如何？」宮大聲曰：「今日有死而已！」操曰：「公如是，奈公之老母妻子何？」宮曰：「吾聞以孝治天下者，不害人之親；施仁政於天下者，不絕人之祀。老母妻子之存亡，亦在於明公耳。吾身既被擒，請即就戮，並無挂念。」,"Lu Bu was silent. Then Gao Shun was brought forward.""What have you to say?"" asked Cao Cao.Gao Shun sulkily held his tongue. He was ordered out to execution.Next Chen Gong was led in.""I hope you have been well since we last saw each other, Chen Gong?"" said Cao Cao.""Your ways were crooked, and so I left you,"" said Chen Gong.""You say I was crooked; and what of your serving Lu Bu?""""Though he was a fool, he did not resemble you in deceit and wickedness.""""You say you are able enough and clever, but what about your position today?""Turning toward Lu Bu, Chen Gong said, ""This man would not follow my advice. Had he done so, he would not now be a captive.""""What think you ought to be done about this day's work?"" said Cao Cao.""There is death for me today, and that is the end!"" said Chen Gong undauntedly.""Very well for you; but what of your mother and wife and children?""""It is said that one who rules with due regard to filial piety does not harm a person's family; one who would show benevolence does not cut off the sacrifices at a person's tomb. My mother and wife and children are in your hands. But since I am your prisoner, I pray you slay me quickly and not to try to harrow my feelings."""
操有留戀之意。宮徑步下樓，左右牽之不住。操起身泣而送之。宮並不回顧。操謂從者曰：「即送公臺老母妻子回許都養老。怠慢者斬。」宮聞言，亦不開口，伸頸就刑。眾皆下淚。操以棺槨盛其屍，葬於許都。後人有詩歎之曰：,"Cao Cao's heart still leaned toward mercy, but Chen Gong turned and walked away, repulsing the attendants who would stop him. Cao Cao rose from his place and walked with Chen Gong, the tears falling from his eyes. Chen Gong never looked at him.Turning to his guards Cao Cao said, ""Let his mother and family be taken to Xuchang and looked after immediately. Any postponement will be punished!""The condemned man heard him but uttered no word. He stretched out his neck for the blow. Tears sprang to the eyes of all present. His remains were honorably coffined and buried in Xuchang.A poem pitying Chen Gong's fate says:"
生死無二志，丈夫何壯哉！不從金石論，空負棟梁材。,"Neither hope of life nor fear of death moved him.How brave was he, a hero indeed!But his lord heeded not his words,Wherefore in vain possessed he great talents."
輔主真堪敬，辭親實可哀。白門身死日，誰肯似公臺！,"Nevertheless, in that he stood by his master.To parting with wife and mother,He merits our pity and profound respect.Who would resemble Chen GongThat day he died at the White Gate Tower?"
方操送宮下樓時，布告玄德曰：「公為坐上客，布為階下囚，何不發一言而相寬乎？」玄德點頭。及操上樓來，布叫曰：「明公所患，不過於布。布今已服矣。公為大將，布副之，天下不難定也。」操回顧玄德曰：「何如？」玄德答曰：「公不見丁建陽、董卓之事乎？」布目視玄德曰：「是兒最無信者！」操令牽下樓縊之。布回顧玄德曰：「大耳兒！不記轅門射戟時耶？」忽一人大叫曰：「呂布匹夫！死則死耳，何懼之有！」眾視之，乃刀斧手擁張遼至。操令將呂布縊死，然後梟首。後人有詩歎曰：,"While Cao Cao sadly escorted Chen Gong on the way to death, Lu Bu appealed to Liu Bei, ""Noble Sir, you sit there an honored guest while poor I lie bound at your feet. Will you not utter one word to alleviate my lot?""Liu Bei nodded.As Cao Cao returned to his place, Lu Bu called out, ""Your only trouble, Illustrious Sir, is myself, and I am on your side now. You take the lead, I will help you, and together the world is at our feet.""""What do you think?"" said Cao Cao turning to Liu Bei.""You are willing to forget the episodes of Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo?""""Truly the lout is not to be trusted!"" said Lu Bu, looking at Liu Bei.""Strangle and expose!"" ordered Cao Cao.As he was led away, Lu Bu turned once more to Liu Bei, ""You long-eared lout, you forget now the service I rendered you that day at my camp gate, when my arrow hit the mark!""Just then someone shouted, ""Lu Bu, O fool! Death is but death, and why are you scared at it?""Everyone turned to look: The guards were hustling Zhang Liao to the place of judgment. Cao Cao ordered Lu Bu's execution.A poet has written upon the death of Lu Bu:"
洪水滔滔淹下邳，當年呂布受擒時：空如赤免馬千里，漫有方天戟一枝。,"The flood spreads wide, the city drowns,Its lord is captive. Nought availsHis courser's speed or halberd's thrust."
縛虎望寬今太懦，養鷹休飽昔無疑。戀妻不納陳宮諫，枉罵無恩大耳兒。,"The tiger erstwhile fierce, now whinesFor mercy. Cao Cao had meted himFull well, a falcon flown at willAnd hungry kept. Poor fool! He letChen Gong's advice be overborneBy harem tattle; vainly nowHe rails against the Long-Ears' faith."
又有詩論玄德曰：傷人餓虎縛休寬，董卓，丁原血未乾。玄德既知能啖父，爭如留取害曹瞞？,"And another poem says:Round is the hungry tiger, eater of men, for whom is no pity,Since the blood of his victims is fresh and not yet dry.Liu Bei spoke no word in favor of Lu Bu,To whom even a father's life was not sacred."
卻說武士擁張遼至。操指遼曰：「這人好生面善。」遼曰：「濮陽城中曾相遇，如何忘卻？」操笑曰：「你原來也記得！」遼曰：「只是可惜！」操曰：「可惜甚的？」遼曰：「可惜當日火不大，不曾燒死你這國賊！」操大怒曰：「敗將安敢辱吾！」拔劍在手，親自來殺張遼。遼全無懼色，引頸待殺。曹操背後一人攀住臂膊，一人詭於面前，說道：「丞相且莫動手！」,"It was recorded earlier that the executioners were hustling Zhang Liao forward.Pointing to him from above, Cao Cao said, ""He has a familiar face.""""You were not likely to forget me: You saw me before in Puyang,"" said Zhang Liao.""O, so you remember me, eh?""""Yes. More is the pity.""""Pity for what?""""That the fire that day was not fierce enough to burn you up, rebel that you are!""Cao Cao began to get angry.""How dare you insult me?"" cried he and lifted his sword to kill the bold speaker.The undaunted Zhang Liao never changed color, but stretched out his neck for the blow. Then a man behind Cao Cao caught his arm, and in front of him another dropped on his knees, saying, ""O Prime Minister, I pray thee stay thy hand!"""
正是：乞哀呂布無人救，罵賊張遼反得生。畢竟救張遼的是誰，且看下文分解。,"Lu Bu whining was not spared,Railing Zhang Liao far better fared.Who was it that saved Zhang Liao? The next chapter will show."
