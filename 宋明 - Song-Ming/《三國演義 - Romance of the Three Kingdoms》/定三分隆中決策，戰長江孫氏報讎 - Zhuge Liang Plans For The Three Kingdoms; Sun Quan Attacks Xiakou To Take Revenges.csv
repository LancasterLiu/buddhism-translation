卻說玄德訪孔明兩次不遇，欲再往訪之。關公曰：「兄長兩次親往拜謁，其禮太過矣。想諸葛亮有虛名而無實學，故避而不敢見。兄何惑於斯人之甚也？」玄德曰：「不然。昔齊桓公欲見東郭野人，五反而方得一面。況吾欲見大賢耶？」張飛曰：「哥哥差矣。量此村夫，何足為大賢？今番不須哥哥去；他如不來，我只用一條麻繩縛將來！」玄德叱曰：「汝皆不聞周文王謁姜子牙之事乎？文王且如此敬賢，汝何太無禮！今番汝休去，我自與雲長去。」飛曰：「既兩位哥哥都去，小弟如何落後？」玄德曰：「汝若同往，不可失禮。」,"Nothing discouraged by two unsuccessful visits to the retreat of the sage whose advice he sought to secure, Liu Bei made preparations for a third visit.His brothers disapproved, and Guan Yu said, ""Brother, you have sought him twice. Surely this is showing even too much deference. I do not believe in this fame of his for learning. He is avoiding you and dare not submit to the test. Why so obstinately hold this idea?""""You are wrong, my brother. In the Spring and Autumn Period Prince Huan of Qi paid five visits to the Eastern Suburb before he got to see Guan Zhong. And my desire to see Zhuge Liang is even greater than his.""""I think you are mistaken,"" said Zhang Fei. ""How can this villager be such a marvel of wisdom? You should not go again and, if he will not come, I will bring him with a hempen rope.""""Have you forgotten the great King Wen's visit to Lu Wang, the old man of the River Wei? If King Wen could show such deference to a wise man, where am I too deferential? If you will not go, your brother and I will go without you,"" said Liu Bei."
飛應諾。於是三人乘馬引從者住隆中。離草廬半里之外，玄德便下馬步行，正遇諸葛均。玄德忙施禮，問曰：「令兄在莊否？」均曰：「昨暮方歸。將軍今日可與相見。」言罷，飄然自去。玄德曰：「今番僥倖，得見先生矣！」張飛曰：「此人無禮！便引我等到莊也不妨！何故竟自去了！」玄德曰：「彼各有事，豈可相強？」,"""If you two go, how can I hang back?"" said Zhang Fei.""If you go, then you must be polite.""Zhang Fei said he would not forget himself, and the three set out. When they were a quarter of mile from the little cottage, Liu Bei dismounted, deciding to show his respect by approaching the house on foot. Very soon he met Zhuge Jun, whom he saluted with great deference, inquiring whether his brother was at home.""He returned last evening. You can see him today, General.""As Zhuge Jun said this, he went off with some swagger.""Fortune favors me this time,"" said Liu Bei. ""I am going to see the Master.""""That was a rude fellow,"" said Zhang Fei. ""It would not have hurt him to have conducted us to the house. Why did he go off like that?""""Each one has his own affairs,"" said Liu Bei. ""What power have we over him?"""
三人來到莊前叩門，童子開門出問。玄德曰：「有勞仙童轉報，劉備專來拜見先生。」童子曰：「今日先生雖在家，但現在草堂上晝寢未醒。」玄德曰：「既如此，且休通報。」分付關、張二人，只在門首等著。玄德徐步而入，見先生仰臥於草堂几席之上。玄德拱立階下。,"Soon the three stood at the door, and they knocked. The serving lad came out and asked their business.Liu Bei said very deferentially, ""I would trouble the servant of the genius, gentle page, to inform the Master that Liu Bei wishes to pay his respects to him.""""My master is at home, but he is asleep.""""In that case do not announce me.""Liu Bei bade his two brothers wait at the door quietly, and he himself entered with careful steps. There was the man he sought, lying asleep on the couch, stretched on a simple mat. Liu Bei saluted him with joined hands at a respectful distance."
半晌，先生未醒。關、張在外立久，不見動靜，入見玄德，猶然侍立。張飛大怒，謂雲長曰：「這先生如何傲慢！見我哥哥侍立階下，他竟高臥，推睡不起！等我去屋後放一把火，看他起不起！」雲長再三勸住。玄德仍命二人出門外等候。望堂上時，見先生翻身將起，忽又朝裡壁睡著。童子欲報。玄德曰：「且勿驚動。」又立了一個時辰，孔明纔醒，口吟詩曰：,"The time passed and still the sleeper did not wake. The two brothers left without, beginning to feel impatient, also came in, and Zhang Fei was annoyed at seeing his revered elder brother respectfully standing by while another slept.""What an arrogant fellow is this Master?"" said he. ""There is our brother waiting, while he sleeps on perfectly carelessly. I will go to the back of the place and let off a bomb and see if that will rouse him.""""No, no! You must do nothing of the kind,"" whispered Guan Yu, and then Liu Bei told them to go out again.Just then Liu Bei noticed that the Master moved. He turned over as though about to rise, but, instead, he faced the wall and again fell asleep. The serving lad made as if he would rouse his master, but Liu Bei forbade him to be disturbed, and Liu Bei waited yet another weary hour. Then Zhuge Liang woke up repeating to himself the lines:"
大夢誰先覺？平生我自知。草堂春睡足，窗外日遲遲。,"""Can any know what fate is his?Yet have I felt throughout my life,The day would come at last to quitThe calm retreat for toil and strife."""
孔明吟罷，翻身問童子曰：「有俗客來否？」童子曰：「劉皇叔在此，立候多時。」孔明乃起身曰：「何不早報！尚容更衣。」遂轉入後堂。又半晌，方整衣冠出迎。玄德見孔明身長八尺，面如冠玉，頭戴綸巾，身披鶴氅，飄飄然有神仙之概。玄德下拜曰：「漢室末冑、涿郡愚夫，久聞先生大名，如雷貫耳。昨兩次晉謁，不得一見，已書賤名於文几，未審得入覽否？」孔明曰：「南陽野人，疏懶性成，屢蒙將軍枉臨，不勝愧赧。」,"As he finished, he turned to the lad, saying, ""Have any of the usual people come?""""Liu Bei, the Uncle of the Emperor is here,"" said the boy. ""He has been waiting a long time.""""Why did you not tell me?"" said he, rising from the couch. ""I must dress.""Zhuge Liang rose and turned into a room behind to dress. In a short time he reappeared, his clothing properly arranged, to receive his visitor.Then Liu Bei saw coming toward him a young man of medium height with a refined face. He wore a head-wrap and a long crane-white gown. He moved with much dignity as though he was rather more than mortal.Liu Bei bowed, saying, ""I am one of the offshoots of the Han family, a simple person from Zhuo. I have long known the Master's fame, which has indeed thundered in my ear. Twice I have come to visit you, without success. Once I left my name on your writing table. You may have my note.""Zhuge Liang replied, ""This hermit is but a dilatory person by temperament. I know I have to thank you for more than one vain visit, and I am ashamed to think of them."""
二人敘禮，分賓主而坐。童子獻茶。茶罷，孔明曰：「昨觀書意，足見將軍憂民憂國之心；但恨亮年幼才疏，有誤下問。」玄德曰：「司馬德操之言，徐元直之語，豈虛談哉？望先生不棄鄙賤，曲賜教誨。」孔明曰：「德操、元直，世之高士。亮乃一耕夫耳，安敢談天下事？二公謬舉矣。將軍奈何舍美玉而求頑石乎？」玄德曰：「大丈夫抱經世奇才，豈可空老於林泉之下？願先生以天下蒼生為念，開備愚魯而賜教。」孔明笑曰：「願聞將軍之志。」玄德屏人促席而告曰：「漢室傾頹，奸臣竊命，備不量力，欲伸大義於天下，而智術淺短，迄無所就。惟先生開其愚而拯厄，實為萬幸。」,"These courteous remarks and the proper bows exchanged, the two men sat in their relative positions as host and guest, and the serving lad brought tea.Then Zhuge Liang said, ""From your letter I know that you grieve for both people and government. If I were not so young and if I possessed any talent, I would venture to question you.""Liu Bei replied, ""Sima Hui and Xu Shu have both spoken of you. Can it be that their words were vain? I trust, O Master, that you will not despise my worthlessness but will condescend to instruct me.""""The two men you speak of are very profound scholars. I am but a peasant, a mere farmer, and who am I that I should talk of empire politics? Those two misled you when they spoke of me. Why do you reject the beautiful jewel for a worthless pebble?""""But your abilities are world embracing and marvelous. How can you be content to allow time to pass while you idle away life in these secluded haunts? I conjure you, O Master, to remember the inhabitants of the empire and remove my crass ignorance by bestowing instruction upon me.""""But what is your ambition, General?""Liu Bei moved his seat nearer to his host and said, ""The Hans are sinking: Designing ministers steal away their authority. I am weak, yet I desire to restore the state to its right mind. But my ignorance is too vast, my means are too slender, and I know not where to turn. Only you, Master, can lighten my darkness and preserve me from falling. How happy should I be if you would do so!"""
孔明曰：「自董卓造逆以來，天下豪傑並起。曹操勢不及袁紹，而竟能克紹者，非惟天時，抑亦人謀也。今操已擁百萬之眾，挾天子以令諸侯，此誠不可與爭鋒。孫權據有江東，已歷三世，國險而民附，此可用為援，而不可圖也。荊州北據漢沔，利盡南海，東連吳會，西通巴蜀，此用武之地，非其主不能守。是殆天所以資將軍，將軍豈可棄乎？益州險塞，沃野千里，天府之國，高祖因之以成帝業。今劉璋闇弱，民殷國富，而不知存恤，智能之士，思得明君。將軍既帝室之冑，信義著於四海，總攬英雄，思賢如渴，若跨有荊益，保其巖阻，西和諸戎，南撫彝越，外結孫權，內修政理；待天下有變，則命一上將，將荊州之兵，以向宛洛；將軍身率益州之眾，以出秦川，百姓有不簞食壼漿以迎將軍者乎？誠如是，則大業可成，漢室可興矣。此亮所以為將軍謀者也。惟將軍圖之。」言罷，命童子取出畫一軸，挂於中堂，指謂玄德曰：「此西川五十四州之圖也。將軍欲成霸業，北讓曹操占天時，南讓孫權占地利，將軍可占人和。先取荊州為家，後即取西川建基業，以成鼎足之勢，然後可圖中原也。」,"Zhuge Liang replied, ""One bold person after another has arisen in various parts of the empire ever since the days of the rebel Dong Zhuo. Cao Cao was not so powerful as Yuan Shao, but he overcame Yuan Shao by seizing the favorable moment and using his soldiers properly. Now he is all-powerful: He rules an immense army and, through his control of the court, the various feudal lords as well. You cannot think of opposing him. Then the Suns have held their territory in the South Land for three generations. Their position in that old state of Wu may not appear too secure, but they have popularity to appeal to. You can gain support but win no success there.""The Region of Jingzhou rests on the two Rivers Han and Mian to the north, and their interests lie in all to the south of these rivers. On the east they touch Wu, and on the west they extend to the ancient states of Ba and Shu. This is the area in which decisive battles have to be won, and one must hold it in order to be secure, and Heaven has virtually made it yours.""The Region of Yizhou in the west is an important place, fertile and extensive, a country favored of Heaven and that through which the Founder of Han obtained the empire. Its ruler Liu Zhang is ignorant and weak. The people are noble and the country prosperous, but he does not know how to hold it all, and all the able people of the region are yearning for an enlightened prince.""As you are a scion of the Family, well known throughout the land as trusty and righteous, a whole-hearted hero, who greatly desires to win the support of the wise, if you get possession of Yizhou and Jingzhou, if on the west you are in harmony with the Rong Tribes, on the south win over the ancient states of Yi and Viet, make an alliance with Sun Quan of Wu, and maintain good government, you can await confidently the day when Heaven shall offer you the desired opportunity. Then you may depute a worthy leader to go to the northeast while you take command of an expedition to the northwest, and will you not find the warmest welcome prepared for you by the people? This done, the completion of the task will be easy. The Hans will be restored. And these are my counsels in all these operations, if you will only undertake them.""Zhuge Liang paused while he bade the lad bring out a map. As this was unrolled Zhuge Liang went on, ""There you see the fifty-four counties of the west. Should you wish to take the overlordship, you will yield the Heaven's favor to Cao Cao in the north, and you will relinquish the Earth's advantage to Sun Quan in the south. You, General, will hold the Human's heart and complete the trinity. Jingzhou is to be taken first as a home, the River Lands next for the foundation of domination. When you are firmly established, you can lay your plans for the attainment of the whole empire."""
玄德聞言，避席拱手謝曰：「先生之言，頓開茅塞，使備如撥雲霧而睹青天；但荊州劉表、益州劉璋，皆漢室宗親，備安忍奪之？」孔明曰：「亮夜觀天象，劉表不久人世。劉璋非立業之主，久後必歸將軍。」玄德聞言，頓首拜謝。只這一席話，乃孔明未出茅廬，已知三分天下，真萬古人不及也！後人有詩讚曰：,"As Zhuge Liang ceased his harangue, Liu Bei left his place and saluted him, saying, ""Your words, O Master, render everything so clear that the clouds are swept aside and I see the clear sky. But Jingzhou belongs to Liu Biao, my kinsman, and Yizhou to another kinsman Liu Zhang. I could hardly take the lands from them.""""I have studied the stars and I know Liu Biao is not long for this world. Further, Liu Zhang is not the sort of man to endure. Both places will certainly fall to you.""Liu Bei bowed his acknowledgments. And so, in one conversation, Zhuge Liang proved that he, who had lived in complete retirement all his life, knew and foresaw the tripod division into which the empire was to break. True, indeed, is it that throughout all the ages no one has ever equaled his intelligence and mastery of the situation."
豫州當日歎孤窮，何幸南陽有臥龍。欲識他年分鼎處，先生笑指畫圖中。,"Behold, when Liu Bei frets that he is weak,Then Sleeping Dragon is not far to seek;When he desires to know how things will hap,The Master, smiling, shows him on the map."
玄德拜請孔明曰：「備雖名微德薄，願先生不棄鄙賤，出山相助。備當拱聽明誨。」孔明曰：「亮久樂耕鋤，懶於應世，不能奉命。」玄德泣曰：「先生不出，如蒼生何？」言畢，淚沾袍袖，衣襟盡濕。孔明見其意甚誠，乃曰：「將軍既不相棄，願效犬馬之勞。」,"""Though I be of small repute and scanty virtue,"" said Liu Bei, ""I hope, O Master, you will not despise me for my worthlessness, but will leave this retreat to help me. I will assuredly listen most reverently to your words.""Zhuge Liang replied, ""I have long been happy on my farm and am fond of my leisure. I fear I cannot obey your command.""Liu Bei wept. ""If you will not, O Master, what will become of the people?""The tears rolled down unchecked upon the lapel and sleeves of Liu Bei's robe. This proved to Zhuge Liang the sincerity of his desire.Hence, Zhuge Liang said, ""General, if you will accept me, I will render what trifling service I can."""
玄德大喜，遂命關、張入拜獻金帛禮物。孔明固辭不受。玄德曰：「此非聘大賢之禮，但表劉備寸心耳。」孔明方受。於是玄德等在莊中共宿一宵。次日，諸葛均回，孔明囑付曰：「吾受劉皇叔三顧之恩，不容不出。汝可躬耕於此，勿得荒蕪田畝。待吾功成之日，即當歸隱。」後人有詩歎曰：,"Liu Bei was greatly delighted. He called in Guan Yu and Zhang Fei to make their bow and brought out the gifts he had prepared. Zhuge Liang refused all the gifts.""These are not gifts to engage your services, but mere proof of my regard,"" said Liu Bei.Then the presents were accepted. They all remained that night at the farm. Next day Zhuge Jun returned, and his brother said to him, ""Uncle Liu Bei has come thrice to see me, and now I must go with him. Keep up the farm in my absence and do not let the place go to ruin. As soon as my work is accomplished, I will certainly return."""
身未升騰思退步，功成應憶去時言。只因先主丁寧後，星落秋風五丈原。,"Then, turning from his humble home,He thought of peaceful days to come,When he should take the homeward wayAnd never beyond the valley stray.But duty kept him in the west,And there he found his place of rest."
又有古風一篇曰：,An old poem may be quoted here:
高皇手提三尺雪，芒碭白蛇夜流血。平秦滅楚入咸陽，二百年前幾斷絕。大哉光武興洛陽，傳至桓、靈又崩。獻帝遷都幸許昌，紛紛四海生豪傑。曹操專權得天時，江東孫氏開鴻業。孤窮玄德走天下，獨居新野愁民危。南陽臥龍有大志，腹內雄兵分正奇。只因徐庶臨行語，茅廬三顧心相知。先生爾時年三九，收拾琴書離隴畝。先取荊州後取川，大展經綸補天手。縱棋舌上鼓風雷，談笑胸中換星斗。龍驤虎視安乾坤，萬古千秋名不朽。,"The Founder of Han seized his gleaming bladeAnd at Mangdang Hills the blood of the white snake flowed.He conquered Qin, destroyed Chu, and entered Xianyang.After two centuries of rule the line was near broken,But Liu Xiu restored the glory at Capital Luoyang.And his children occupied the throneTill decay began in the days of Huan and Ling.The Emperor Xian removed the capital to Xuchang,And, within the four seas, all was confusion.Bold spirits started up in fierce contention.Cao Cao, seized the favorable momentAnd the imperial authority passed into his hands.While the Suns made to themselvesA glorious heritage at the Great River,Solitary and poor, Liu Bei wandered from place to place,Till he found a haven in Xinye.Sorely distressed he was at the sorrows of the people,But Sleeping Dragon conceived a noble ambition,Within his breast were thoughtsOf great things to be accomplished by force of arms.Then, because of the parting words of Xu Shu,And by the thrice repeated visits to his retreat,The great hero found and knew his mentor.When the age of Zhuge Liang was but thrice nine years,He turned from his books, put aside his lute,And left the peaceful fields he had loved,Under his guidance Jingzhou was takenAnd the two Lands of the Rivers conquered.He unrolled great schemes, as one all knowing,In speech, he went to and fro in the world,The sound of war drums rolled from his tongue,The words from his heart stirred one to the utmost depths.The dragon pranced, the tiger glared,And peace was brought to the world.Through all the ages his fame shall never decay."
玄德等三人別了諸葛均，與孔明同歸新野。玄德待孔明如師，食則同桌，寢則同榻，終日共論天下之。孔明曰：「曹操於冀州作玄武池以練水軍，必有侵江南之意，可密令人過江探聽虛實。」玄德從之，使人往江東探聽。,"After taking leave of Zhuge Jun, Liu Bei and his followers left for Xinye, with Zhuge Liang as companion. When they took up their abode there, Zhuge Liang was treated as a mentor, eating at the same table, sleeping on the same couch as Liu Bei. They spent whole days conversing over the affairs of the empire.Zhuge Liang said, ""Cao Cao is training his troops for naval service in Aquamarine Lake, and hence certainly intends to invade the country south of the Great River. We ought to send our spies to ascertain what Cao Cao and Sun Quan are really doing.""So spies were dispatched."
卻說孫權自孫策死後，據住江東，承父兄基業，廣納賢士，開賓館於吳會，命顧雍、張紘延接四方賓客。連年以來，你我相薦。時有會稽闞澤，字德潤；彭城嚴畯，字曼才；沛縣薛綜，字敬文；汝南程秉，字德樞；吳郡朱桓，字休穆；陸績，字公紀；吳人張溫，字惠恕；會稽凌統，字公續；烏程吳粲，字孔休：此數人皆至江東。孫權敬禮甚厚。又得良將數人，乃汝陽呂蒙，字子明，吳郡陸遜，字伯言，瑯琊徐盛，字文嚮，東郡潘璋，字文珪，廬江丁奉，字承淵。文武諸人，共相輔佐。由此江東稱得人之盛。,"Now after Sun Quan succeeded to the heritage of his father and brother, he sent far and wide to invite people of ability to aid him. He established lodging places for them in Kuaiji in Wu, and directed Gu Yong and Zhang Hong to welcome and entertain all those who came. And year by year they flocked in, one recommending another. Among them were Kan Ze of Kuaiji, Yan Jun of Pengcheng, Xue Yong of Beishan, Cheng Bing of Runan, Zhu Huan of Wujun, Lu Ji of the same place, Zhang Wen of Wucheng, Luo Tong of Kuaiji, and Wu Can of Wushang. All these scholars were treated with great deference.Many able leaders came also. Among them were Lu Meng of Runan, Lu Xun of Wujun, Xu Sheng of Langye, Pan Zhang of Dongjun, and Ding Feng of Lujiang. Thus Sun Quan obtained the assistance of many people of ability both in peace and war and all went well with him."
建安七年，曹操破袁紹，遣使往江東，命孫權遣子入朝隨駕。權猶豫未決。吳太夫人命周瑜、張昭等面議。張昭曰：「操欲令我遣子入朝，是牽制諸侯之法也。然若不令去，恐其興兵下江東，勢必危矣。」周瑜曰：「將軍承父兄遣業，兼六郡之眾，兵精糧足，將士用命，有何逼迫而欲送質於人？質一入，不得不與曹氏連和；彼有命召，不得不往；如此則見制於人也。不如勿遣，徐觀其變，別以良策禦之。」吳太夫人曰：「公瑾之言是也。」權遂從其言，謝使者，不遣子。自此曹操有下江南之意。但正值北方未寧，無暇南征。,"In the seventh year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 202), Cao Cao had broken the power of Yuan Shao. Then he sent a messenger to the South Land ordering Sun Quan to send his son to court to serve in the retinue of the Emperor.Sun Quan, however, hesitated to comply with this request, and the matter was the subject of much discussion. His mother, Lady Wu, sent for Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao and asked their advice.Zhang Zhao said, ""Cao Cao wishes a son to be present at court as a hostage whereby he has a hold upon us, as formerly was the case with all the feudal chiefs. If we do not comply with this request, he will doubtless attack the region. There is some peril.""Zhou Yu said, ""Our lord has succeeded to the heritage and has a large army of veterans and ample supplies. He has able officers ready to do his bidding. So why should he be compelled to send a hostage to any person? To send a hostage is to be forced into joining Cao Cao, and to carry out his behests, whatever they be. Then we shall be in his power. It would be better not to send, but rather to wait patiently the course of events and prepare plans to attack.""""That is also my opinion,"" said the Dowager.So Sun Quan dismissed the messenger but did not send his son. Cao Cao resented this and had since nourished schemes against the South Land. But their realization had been delayed by the dangers on the north and, so far, no attack had been made."
建安八年十一月，孫權引兵伐黃祖，戰於大江之中。祖軍敗績。權部將凌操，輕舟當先，殺人夏口，被黃祖部將甘寧一箭射死。凌操子凌統，時年方十五歲，奮力往奪父屍而歸。權見風色不利，收軍還東吳。,"Late in the eighth year (AD 203), Sun Quan led his armies against Huang Zu and fought on the Great River, where he was successful in several battles. One of Sun Quan's leaders, Ling Cao, led a fleet of light vessels up the river and broke into Xiakou but was killed by an arrow of Gan Ning, a general of Huang Zu. Ling Cao left a son, Ling Tong, fifteen years of age, who led another expedition to recover his father's corpse and was so far successful. After that, as the war was inclined to go against him, Sun Quan returned again to his own country."
卻說孫權弟孫翊為丹陽太守。翊性剛好酒，醉後嘗鞭撻士卒。丹陽督將媯覽、郡丞戴員二人，常有殺翊之心，乃與翊從人邊洪結為心腹，共謀殺翊。時諸將縣令，皆集丹陽。翊設宴相待。翊妻徐氏美而慧，極善卜易；是日卜一卦，其象大凶，勸翊勿出會客。翊不從，遂與眾大會。,"Now Sun Quan's younger brother, Sun Yi, was Governor of Dangyang. He was a hard man and given to drink and, in his cups, very harsh to his people, ordering the infliction of severe floggings. Two of his officers, Military Inspector Gui Lan and Secretary Dai Yuan, bore their chief a grudge and sought to assassinate him. They took into their confidence one Bian Hong, of the escort, and the three plotted to kill their master at a great assembly of officials at Dangyang amid the banquets.Sun Yi's wife, Lady Xu, was skilled in divination, and on the day of the great banquet she cast a most inauspicious lot. Wherefore she besought her husband to stay away from the assembly. But he was obstinate and went."
至晚席散，邊洪帶刀跟出門外，即抽刀砍死孫翊。媯覽、戴員乃歸罪邊洪，斬之於市。二人乘勢擄翊家資侍妾。媯覽見徐氏美貌，乃謂之曰：「吾為汝夫報仇，汝當從我；不從則死。」徐氏曰：「夫死未幾，不忍便相從。可待至晦日，設祭除服，然後成親未遲。」,"The faithless guardsman followed his master in the dusk when the gathering dispersed, and stabbed him with a dagger.The two prime movers at once seized Bian Hong and beheaded him in the market place. Then they went to Sun Yi's residence, which they plundered.Gui Lan was taken with the beauty of the dead Governor's wife and told her, ""I had avenged the death of your husband, and you must go with me.""Lady Xu pleaded, saying, ""It is too soon after my husband's death to think of remarriage. But as soon as the thirty-day mourning sacrifices are over, I will be yours."""
覽從之。徐氏乃密召孫翊心腹舊將孫高、傅嬰二人入府，泣告曰：「先夫在日，常言二公忠義。今媯、戴二賊，謀殺我夫，只歸罪邊洪，將我家資童婢盡皆分去。媯覽又欲強占妾身，妾已詐許之，以安其心。二將軍可差人星夜報知吳侯，一面設密計以圖二賊，雪此仇辱，生死啣恩！」言畢再拜。孫高、傅嬰皆泣曰：「我等平日感府君恩遇，今日所以不即死難者，正欲為復仇計耳。夫人所命，敢不效力？」,"She thus obtained a respite, which she utilized to send for two old generals of her husband, Sun Gao and Fu Ying. They came and she tearfully told her tale.""My husband had great faith in you. Now Gui Lan and Dai Yuan have compassed his death and have laid the crime on Bian Hong. They have plundered my house and carried off my servants. Worse than this, Gui Lan insists that I shall be his wife. To gain time I have pretended to favor this proposal, and I pray you now send the news to my husband's brother and beg him to slay these two miscreants and avenge this wrong. I will never forget your kindness in this life or the next.""And she bowed before them.They wept also and said, ""We were much attached to our master; and now that he has come to an untimely end, we must avenge him. Dare we not carry out your behests?"""
於是密遣心腹使者往報孫權。至晦日，徐氏先召孫、傅二人，伏於密室幃幕之中，然後設祭於堂上。祭畢，即除去孝服，沐浴薰香，濃妝豔裹，言笑自若。,"So they sent a trusty messenger to Sun Quan.On the day of the sacrifices Lady Xu called in her two friends and hid them in a secret chamber. Then the ceremonies were performed in the great hall. These over, she put off her mourning garb, bathed and perfumed herself, and assumed an expression of joy. She laughed and talked as usual."
媯覽聞之甚喜。至夜，徐氏遣婢妾請覽入府。設席堂中飲酒。飲既醉，徐氏乃邀覽入密室。覽喜，乘醉而入。徐氏大呼曰：「孫、傅二將軍何在？」二人即從幃幕中持刀躍出。媯覽措手不及，被傅嬰一刀砍倒在地，孫高再復一刀，登時殺死。徐氏復傳請戴員赴宴。員入府來，至堂中，亦被孫、傳二將所殺。一面使人誅戮二賊家小，及其餘黨。徐氏遂重穿孝服，將媯覽、戴員首級，祭於孫翊靈前。不一日，孫權自領軍馬至丹陽，見徐氏已殺媯、戴二賊，乃封孫高、傅嬰為牙門將，令守丹陽，取徐氏歸家養老。江東人無不稱徐氏之德。後人有詩讚曰：,"Thus Gui Lan rejoiced in his heart, thinking of the pleasure that was to be his.When night came she sent a servant girl to call her suitor to the palace, where she entertained him at supper. When he had well drunk, she suggested that they should retire and led him to the chamber where her friends were waiting. He followed without the least hesitation.As soon as she entered the room, she called out, ""Where are you, Generals?""Out rushed Sun Gao and Fu Ying, and the drunken Gui Lan, incapable of any resistance, was dispatched with daggers.Next Lady Xu invited Dai Yuan to a supper, and he was slain in similar fashion. After that, she sent to the houses of her enemies and slew all therein. This done, she resumed her mourning garb, and the heads of the two men were hung as a sacrifice before the coffin of her husband.Very soon her brother-in-law came with an army, and hearing the story of the deeds of the two generals from the widow, gave them the ranks of Commandership and put them over Dangyang. When Sun Quan left, he took the widow to his own home so that she would be cared for. All those who heard of her brave conduct were loud in praise of her virtue:"
才節雙全世所無，姦回一旦受摧鋤。庸臣從賊忠臣死，不及東吳女丈夫。,"Full of resource and virtuous, few in the world are like her,Guilefully wrought she and compassed the death of the lusty assassins,Faithful servants are always ready to deal with rebellion,None can ever excel that heroine famous in Wu."
且說東吳各處山賊，盡皆平復。大江之中，有戰船七千餘隻。孫權拜周瑜為大都督，總統江東水陸軍馬。建安十二年，冬十月，權母吳太夫人病危，召周瑜、張昭二人至，謂曰：「吾本吳人，幼亡父母，與弟吳景徙居越中。後嫁與孫氏，生四子。長子策生時，吾夢月入懷。後生次子權，又夢日入懷。卜者云：『夢日月入懷者，其子必貴。』不幸策早喪，今將江東基業付權。望公等同心助之，吾死不朽矣！」又囑權曰：「汝事子布、公瑾以師傅之禮，不可怠慢。吾妹與我共嫁汝父，則亦汝之母也，吾死之後，事吾妹如事我。汝妹亦當恩養，擇佳婿以嫁之。」,"The brigandage that had troubled the South Land had all been suppressed, and a large fleet of seven thousand battleships was in the Great River ready for service. Sun Quan appointed Zhou Yu to be the Supreme Admiral and Commander-in-Chief over all military forces.In the twelfth year (AD 207), the Dowager Wu, feeling her end approaching, called to her the two advisers Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao and spoke thus: ""I came of a family of the old Wu, but losing my parents in early life. My brother Wu Jing and I went into the old Yue, and then I married into this family. I bore my husband four sons, not without premonitions of the greatness to be theirs. With my first, Sun Ce, I dreamed of the moon and with my second, Sun Quan, of the sun, which omens were interpreted by the soothsayer as signs of their great honor. Unhappy Sun Ce died young, but Sun Quan inherited, and it is he whom I pray you both assist with one accord. Then may I die in peace.""And to her son she said, ""These two you are to serve as they were your teachers and treat them with all respect. My younger sister and I both were wives to your father, and so she is also a mother to you, and you are to serve her after I am gone as you now serve me. And you must treat your sister with affection and find a handsome husband for her."""
言訖遂終。孫權哀哭，具喪葬之禮，自不必說。至來年春，孫權商議欲伐黃祖。張昭曰：「居喪未及期年，不可動兵，」周瑜曰：「報仇雪恨，何待期年？」權猶豫未決。適北平都尉呂蒙入見，告權曰：「某把龍湫水口，忽有黃祖部將甘寧來降。某細詢之。寧字興霸，巴郡臨江人也；頗通書史，有氣力，好游俠；嘗招合亡命，縱橫於江湖之中；腰懸銅鈴，人聽鈴聲，盡皆避之。又嘗以西川錦作帆幔，時人皆稱為『錦帆賊』。後悔前非，改行從善，引眾投劉表。見表不能成事，即欲來投東吳，卻被黃祖留住在夏口。,"Then she died and her son mourned for her that year.The following year, they began to discuss an attack upon Huang Zu.Zhang Zhao said, ""The armies should not move during the period of mourning.""However, Zhou Yu, more to the point, said, ""Vengeance should not be postponed on that account. It could not wait upon times and seasons.""Still Sun Quan halted between two opinions and would not decide.Then came Commander Lu Meng who said to his master, ""While I was at Dragon Gorge, one leader of Huang Zu, Gan Ning from Lingjiang, offered to surrender. I found out all about him. He is something of a scholar, is forceful, fond of wandering about as a fighter-errant. He assembled a band of outlaws with whom he roamed over the rivers and lakes, where he would terrorize everybody. He wore a bell at his waist, and at the sound of this bell everyone fled and hid. He fitted his boats with sails of Xichuan brocade, and people called him the 'Pirate with Silken Sails.'""Then he reformed. He and his band went to Liu Biao, but they left him when they saw he would never accomplish anything, and now they would serve under your banner, only that Huang Zu detains them at Xiakou."
「前東吳破祖時，祖得甘寧之力，救回夏口；乃待寧甚薄。都督蘇飛屢薦寧於祖。祖曰：『寧乃劫江之賊，豈可重用？』寧因此懷恨。蘇飛知其意，乃置酒邀寧到家，謂之曰：『吾薦公數次，奈主公不能用。日月逾邁，人生幾何；宜自遠圖。吾當保公為鄂縣長，自作去就之計。』寧因此得過夏口，欲投江東，恐江東恨其救黃祖殺凌操之事。某具言主公求賢若渴，不記舊恨；況各為其主，又何恨焉？寧欣然引眾渡江，來見主公。乞鈞旨定奪。」,"Formerly when you were attacking Huang Zu, he owed the recovery of Xiakou to this same Gan Ning, whom he treated without liberality. When Commander Su Fei recommended Gan Ning for promotion, Huang Zu said, 'He is unsuited for any high position as, after all, he is no more than a pirate.'""So Gan Ning became a disappointed and resentful man. Su Fei tried to win him over to good humor and invited him to wine parties and said, 'I have put your name forward many times, but our chief says he has no place suitable for you. However, time slips away and man's life is not very long. One must make the most of it. I will put you forward for the magistracy of Exian, whence you may be able to advance.'""So Gan Ning got away from Xiakou and would have come to you then, but he feared that he would not be welcomed, since he had assisted Huang Zu and killed Ling Cao. I told him you were always ready to welcome able people and would nourish no resentment for former deeds. After all, every person was bound to do his best for his master. He would come with alacrity if he only felt sure of a welcome. I pray you express your pleasure."""
孫權大喜曰：「吾得興霸，破黃祖必矣。」遂命呂蒙引甘寧入見。參拜已畢，權曰：「興霸來此，大獲我心，豈有記恨之理？請無懷疑。願教我以破黃祖之策。」寧曰：「今漢祚日危，曹操終必纂竊。荊南之地，操所必爭也。劉表無遠慮，其子又愚劣，不能承業傳基。明公宜早圖之。若遲，則操先圖之矣。今宜先取黃祖。祖今年老昏邁，務於貨利；侵刻吏民，人心皆怨；戰具不修，軍無法律。明公若往攻之，其勢必破。既破祖軍，鼓行而西，據楚關而圖巴蜀，霸業可定也。」,"This was good news for Sun Quan and he said, ""With his help, I could destroy Huang Zu.""Then Sun Quan bade Lu Meng bring Gan Ning to see him.When the salutations were over, the chief said, ""My heart is entirely captivated by your coming. I feel no resentment against you. I hope you will have no doubts on that score, and I may as well tell you that I desire some plan for the destruction of Huang Zu.""Gan Ning replied, ""The dynasty is decadent and without influence. Cao Cao will finally absorb the country down to the river unless he is opposed. Liu Biao provides nothing against the future, and his sons are quite unfitted to succeed him. You should lay your plans to oust him at once before Cao Cao anticipates you. The first attack should be made on Huang Zu, who is getting old and avaricious, so that everyone hates him. He is totally unprepared for a fight and his army is undisciplined. He would fall at the first blow. If he were gone, you would control the western passes and could conquer the lands of Ba and Shu. And you would be securely established."""
孫權曰：「此金玉之論也！」遂命周瑜為大都督，總水陸軍兵；呂蒙為前部先鋒；董襲與甘寧為副將；權自領大軍十萬，征討黃祖。細作探知，報至江夏。黃祖急聚眾商議，令蘇飛為大將，陳就、鄧龍為先鋒，盡起江夏之兵迎敵。陳就、鄧龍各引一隊艨艟截住沔口，艨艟上各設強弓硬弩千餘張，將大索繫定艨艟於水面上。東吳兵至，艨艟上鼓響，弓弩齊發，兵不敢進，約退數里水面。甘寧謂董襲曰：「事已至此，不得不進。」乃選小船百餘隻，每船用精兵五十人。──二十人撐船，三十人各披衣甲，手執鋼刀，──不避矢石，直至艨艟傍邊，砍斷大索，艨艟遂橫。,"""The advice is most valuable,"" said Sun Quan, and he made his preparations.Zhou Yu was appointed Commander-in-Chief; Lu Meng was Van Leader; Dong Xi and Gan Ning were Generals. Sun Quan himself would command the main army of one hundred thousand troops.The spies reported that to Huang Zu who, at the news of an expedition against him, called his officers together to consult. He placed Su Fei in chief command. He also appointed Chen Jiu and Deng Long as Van Leaders, and prepared for general defense. He had two hundreds of warships under the command of Chen Jiu and Deng Long. On these he placed strong bows and stiff crossbows to the number of more than a thousand and secured the boats to heavy hawsers so that they formed a barrier in the river.At the approach of the southern fleet, the drums beat for the ships to attack. Soon arrows and bolts flew thick, forcing back the invaders, who withdrew till several miles of water lay between them and the defenders.""We must go forward,"" said Gan Ning to Dong Xi.So they chose a hundred light craft and put picked men on them, fifty to a boat. Twenty were to row the boats and thirty to fight. These latter were armored swordsmen. Careless of the enemy's missiles these boats advanced, got to the defenders' fleet, and cut the hawsers of their ships so that they drifted hither and thither in confusion."
甘寧飛上艨艟，將鄧龍砍死。陳就棄船而走。呂蒙見了，跳下小船，自舉櫓棹，直入船隊，放火燒船。陳就急待上岸，呂蒙捨命趕到跟前，當胸一刀砍翻。比及蘇飛引軍於岸上接應時，吳軍一齊上岸，勢不可當。祖軍大敗。蘇飛落荒而走，正遇東吳大將潘璋。兩馬相交，戰不數合，被璋生擒過去，逕至船中來見孫權。權命左右以檻車囚之，待活捉了黃祖，一并誅戮；催動三軍，不分晝夜，攻打夏口。正是：只因不用錦帆賊，至令衝開大索船。不知黃祖勝負如何，且看下文分解。,"Gan Ning leaped upon one boat and killed Deng Long. Chen Jiu left the fleet and set out for the shore. Lu Meng dropped into a small boat and went among the larger ships setting them on fire. When Chen Jiu had nearly reached the bank, Lu Meng reckless of death went after him, got ahead, and struck him full in the breast so that he fell.Before long Su Fei came along the bank with reinforcements, but it was too late. The armies of the South Land had already landed, and there was no hope of repelling them. Su Fei fled into the open country, but he was made prisoner.Su Fei was taken to Sun Quan who ordered that he be put into a cage-cart and kept till Huang Zu should be captured. Then he would execute the pair. And the attack was pressed on. Day and night they wrought to capture Xiakou.He sees his ships cut loose and burned,By the Silk-sailed Pirate he once spurned.For Huang Zu's fate, see next chapter."
