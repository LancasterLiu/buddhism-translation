旻天疾威、天篤降喪。瘨我饑饉、民卒流亡。我居圉卒荒。,"Compassionate Heaven is arrayed in angry terrors;Heaven is indeed sending down ruin,Afflicting us with famine,So that the people are all wandering fugitives; -In the settled regions and on the borders all is desolation."
天降罪罟、蟊賊內訌、昏椓靡共、潰潰回遹、實靖夷我邦。,"Heaven sends down its net of crime; -Devouring insects, who weary and confuse men's minds,Ignorant, oppressive, neglient,Breeders of confusion, utterly perverse:These are the men employed to tranquilize our country."
臯臯訿訿、曾不知其玷。兢兢業業、孔填不寧、我位孔貶。,"Insolent and slanderous, -[The king] does not know a flaw in them.We, careful and feeling in peril,For long in unrest,Are constantly subjected to degradation."
如彼歲旱、草不潰茂。如彼棲苴。我相此邦、無不潰止。,"As in a year of drought,The grass not attaining to luxuriance;As water plants attached to a tree;So do I see in this country,All going to confusion."
維昔之富、不如時、維今之疚、不如茲。彼疏斯粺、胡不自替、職兄斯引。,"The wealth of former days,,Was not like our present condition.The distress of the present,Did not previously reach this degree.Those are [like] coarse rice, these are [like] fine; -Why do you not retire of yourselves,But prolong my anxious sorrow?"
池之竭矣、不云自頻。泉之竭矣、不云自中。溥斯害矣、職兄斯弘、不烖我躬。,"A pool becomes dry, -Is it not because no water comes to it from its banks?A spring becomes dry, -Is it not because no water rises in it from itself?Great is the injury [all about].So that my anxious sorrow is increased.Will not calamity light on my person?"
昔先王受命、有如召公、日辟國百里。今也日蹙國百里。於乎哀哉、維今之人、不尚有舊。,"Formerly when the former kings received their appointment,There were such ministers as the duke of Shao,Who would in a day enlarge the kingdom a hundred li;Now it is contracted in a day a hundred li.Oh! Alas!Among the men of the present day,Are there not still some with the old virtue?"
