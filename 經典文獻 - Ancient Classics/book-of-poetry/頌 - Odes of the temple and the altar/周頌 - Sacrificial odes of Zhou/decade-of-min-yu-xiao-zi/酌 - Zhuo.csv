於鑠王師、遵養時晦。時純熙矣、是用大介。我龍受之、蹻蹻王之造。載用有嗣、實維爾公允師。,"Oh! powerful was the king's army;But he nursed it in obedience to circumstances while the time was yet dark.When the time was clearly bright,He thereupon donned his grand armour.We have been favoured to receive,What the martial king accomplished.To deal aright with what we have inherited,We have to be sincere imitators of thy course, [O king]."
