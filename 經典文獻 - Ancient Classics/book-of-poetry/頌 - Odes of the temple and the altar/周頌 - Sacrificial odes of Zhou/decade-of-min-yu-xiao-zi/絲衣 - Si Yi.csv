絲衣其紑、載弁俅俅。自堂徂基、自羊徂牛。鼐鼎及鼒、兕觥其觩。旨酒思柔。不吳不敖、胡考之休。,"In his silken robes, clear and bright,With his cap on his head, looking so respectful,From the hall he goes to the foot of the stairs,And from the sheep to the oxen.[He inspects] the tripods, large and small,And the curved goblet of rhinoceros horn.The good spirits are mild;There is no noise, no insolence:An auspice, [all this], of great longevity."
