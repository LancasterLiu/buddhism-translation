訪予落止、率時昭考。於乎悠哉、朕未有艾。將予就之、繼猶判渙。維予小子、未堪家多難。紹庭上下、陟降厥家。休矣皇考、以保明其身。,"I take counsel at the beginning of my [rule],How I can follow [the example] of my shrined father.Ah! far-reaching [were his plans],And I am not yet able to carry them out.However I endeavour to reach to them,My continuation of them will still be all-deflected.I am [but as] a little child,Unequal to the many difficulties of the State.In his room, [I will look for him] to go up and come down in the court,To ascend and descend in the house.Admirable art thou, O great Father,[Condescend] to preserve and enlighten me."
