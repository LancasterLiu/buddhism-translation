文王既勤止、我應受之。敷時繹思、我徂維求定。時周之命、於繹思。,"King Wen laboured earnestly; -Right is it we should have received [the kingdom].We will diffuse [his virtue], ever cherishing the thought of him;Henceforth we will seek only the settlement [of the kingdom].It was he through whom came the appointment of Zhou;Oh! let us ever cherish the thought of him."
