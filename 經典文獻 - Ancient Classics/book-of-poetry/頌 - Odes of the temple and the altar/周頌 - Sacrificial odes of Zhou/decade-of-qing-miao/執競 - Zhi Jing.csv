執競武王、無競維烈。不顯成康、上帝是皇。自彼成康、奄有四方、斤斤其明。鐘鼓喤喤、磬筦將將、降福穰穰。降福簡簡、威儀反反。既醉既飽、福祿來反。,"The arm of king Wu was full of strength;Irresistable was his ardour.Greatly illustrious were Cheng and Kang,Kinged by God.When we consider how Cheng and Kang,Grandly held all within the four quarters [of the kingdom],How penetrating was their intelligence!The bells and drums sound in harmony;The sounding stones and flutes blend their notes;Abundant blessing is sent down.Blessing is sent down in large measure;Careful and exact is all our deportment;We have drunk, and we have eaten, to the full;Our happiness and dignity will be prolonged."
