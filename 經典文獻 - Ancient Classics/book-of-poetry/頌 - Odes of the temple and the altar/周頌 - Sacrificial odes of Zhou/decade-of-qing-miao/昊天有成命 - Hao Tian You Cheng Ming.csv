昊天有成命、二后受之。成王不敢康、夙夜基命宥密。於緝熙、單厥心。肆其靖之。,"Heaven made its determinate appointment,Which [our] two sovereigns received.King Cheng did not dare to rest idly in it.But night and day enlarged its foundations by his deep and silent virtue.How did he continue and glorify [his heritage],Exerting all his heart,And so securing its tranquillity!"
