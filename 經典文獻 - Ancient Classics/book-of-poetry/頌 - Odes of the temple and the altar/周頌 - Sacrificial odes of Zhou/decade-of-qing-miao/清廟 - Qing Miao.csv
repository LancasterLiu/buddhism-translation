於穆清廟、肅雝顯相。濟濟多士、秉文之德。對越在天、駿奔走在廟。不顯不承、無射於人斯。,"Ah! solemn is the ancestral temple in its pure stillness.Reverent and harmonious were the distinguished assistants;Great was the number of the officers:[All] assiduous followers of the virtue of [king] Wen.In response to him in heaven,Grandly they hurried about in the temple.Distinguished is he and honoured,And will never be wearied of among men."
