維天之命、於穆不已。於乎不顯、文王之德之純。假以溢我、我其收之。駿惠我文王、曾孫篤之。,"The ordinances of Heaven, -How deep are they and unintermitting!And oh! how illustrious,Was the singleness of the virtue of king Wen!How does he [now] show his kindness?We will receive [his favour],Striving to be in accord with him, our king Wen;And may his remotest descendant be abundantly the same!"
