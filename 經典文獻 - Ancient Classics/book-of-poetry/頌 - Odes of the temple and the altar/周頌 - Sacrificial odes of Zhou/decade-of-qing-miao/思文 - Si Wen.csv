思文后稷、克配彼天、立我烝民、莫匪爾極。貽我來牟、帝命率育。無此疆爾界、陳常于時夏。,"O accomplished Hou-ji,Thou didst prove thyself the correlate of Heaven;Thou didst give grain-food to our multitudes; -The immense gift of thy goodness.Thou didst confer on us the wheat and the barley,Which God appointed for the nourishment of all;And without distinction of territory or boundary,The rules of social duty were diffused throughout these great regions."
