有來雝雝、至止肅肅。相維辟公、天子穆穆。於薦廣牡、相予肆祀。假哉皇考、綏予孝子。宣哲維人、文武維后。燕及皇天、克昌厥後。綏我眉壽、介以繁祉。既右烈考、亦右文母。,"They come full of harmony;They are here, in all gravity; -The princes assisting,While the Son of Heaven looks profound.'While I present [this] noble bull,And they assist me in setting forth the sacrifice,O great and august Father,Comfort me, your filial Son!'With penetrating wisdom thou did'st play the man,A sovereign with the gifts both of peace and war,Giving rest even to great Heaven,And ensuring prosperity to thy descendants.'Thou comfortest me with the eyebrows of longevity;Thou makest me great with manifold blessings.I offer this sacrifice to my meritorious father,And to my accomplished mother.
