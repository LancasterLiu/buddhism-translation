於皇武王、無競維烈。允文文王、克開厥後。嗣武受之、勝殷遏劉、耆定爾功。,"Oh! great wast thou, O king Wu,Displaying the utmost strength in thy work.Truly accomplished was king Wen,Opening the path for his successors.Thou did'st receive the inheritance from him;Thou did'st vanquish Yin, and put a stop to its cruelties; -Effecting the firm establishment of thy merit."
