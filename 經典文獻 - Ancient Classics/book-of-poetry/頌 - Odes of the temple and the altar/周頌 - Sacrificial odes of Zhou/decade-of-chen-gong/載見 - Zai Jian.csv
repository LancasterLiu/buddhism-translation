載見辟王、曰求厥章。龍旂陽陽、和鈴央央。鞗革有鶬、休有烈光。率見昭考、以孝以享、以介眉壽。永言保之、思皇多祜。烈文辟公、綏以多福、俾緝熙于純嘏。,"They appeared before their sovereign king,To seek from him the rules [they were to observe].With their dargon-emblazoned banners, flying bright,The bells on them and their front-boards tinkling,And with the rings on the ends of the reins glittering,Admirable was their majesty, and splendour.He led them to appear before his father shrined on the left,Where he discharged hisi filial duty, and presented his offerings; -That he might have granted to him long life,And ever preserve [his dignity].Great and many are his blessings.They are the brilliant and accomplished princes.Who cheer him with his many sources of happiness,Enabling him to perpetuate them in their brightness as pure blessing."
