有瞽有瞽、在周之庭。設業設虡、崇牙樹羽、應田縣鼓、鞉磬柷圉。既備乃奏。簫管備舉。喤喤厥聲、肅雝和鳴、先祖是聽。我客戾止、永觀厥成。,"There are the blind musicians; there are the blind musicians;In the court of [the temple of] Zhou.There are [the music frames] with their face-boards and posts,The high toothed-edge [of the former], and the feathers stuck [in the latter];With the drums, large and small, suspended from them;And the hand-drums and sounding-stones, the instrument to give the signal for commencing, and the stopper.These being all complete, the music is struck up.The pan-pipe and the double-flute begin at the same time.Harmoniously blend their sounds;In solemn unison they give forth their notes.Our ancestors will give ear;Our visitors will be there; -Long to witness the complete performance."
