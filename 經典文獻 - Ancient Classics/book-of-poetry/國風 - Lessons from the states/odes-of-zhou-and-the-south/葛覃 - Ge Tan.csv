葛之覃兮、施于中谷。維葉萋萋、黃鳥于飛。集于灌木、其鳴喈喈。,"How the dolichos spread itself out,Extending to the middle of the valley!Its leaves were luxuriant;The yellow birds flew about,And collected on the thickly growing trees,Their pleasant notes resounding far."
葛之覃兮、施于中谷。維葉莫莫、是刈是濩。為絺為綌、服之無斁。,"How the dolichos spread itself out,Extending to the middle of the valley!Its leaves were luxuriant and dense.I cut it and I boiled it,And made both fine cloth and coarse,Which I will wear without getting tired of it."
言告師氏、言告言歸。薄污我私、薄澣我衣。害澣害否、歸寧父母 。,"I have told the matron,Who will announce that I am going to see my parents.I will wash my private clothes clean,And I will rinse my robes.Which need to be rinsed, which do not?I am going back to visit my parents."
