采采卷耳、不盈頃筐。嗟我懷人、寘彼周行。,"I was gathering and gathering the mouse-ear,But could not fill my shallow basket.With a sigh for the man of my heart,I placed it there on the highway."
陟彼崔嵬、我馬虺隤。我姑酌彼金罍、維以不永懷。,"I was ascending that rock-covered height,But my horses were too tired to breast it.I will now pour a cup from that gilded vase,Hoping I may not have to think of him long."
陟彼高岡、我馬玄黃。我姑酌彼兕觥、維以不永傷。,"I was ascending that lofty ridge,But my horses turned of a dark yellow.I will now take a cup from that rhinoceros' horn,Hoping I may not have long to sorrow."
陟彼砠矣、我馬瘏矣、我僕痡矣、云何吁矣。,"I was ascending that flat-topped height,But my horses became quite disabled,And my servants were [also] disabled.Oh! how great is my sorrow!"
