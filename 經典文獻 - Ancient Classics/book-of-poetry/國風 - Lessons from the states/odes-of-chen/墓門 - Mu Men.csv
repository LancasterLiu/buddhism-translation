墓門有棘、斧以斯之。夫也不良、國人知之。知而不已、誰昔然矣。,"At the gate to the tombs there are jujube trees; -They should be cut away with an axe.That man is not good,And the people of the State know it.They know it, but he does not give over; -Long time has it been thus with him."
墓門有梅、有鴞萃止。夫也不良、歌以訊之。訊予不顧、顛倒思予。,"At the gate to the tombs there are plum trees;And there are owls collecting on them.That man is not good,And I sing [this song] to admonish him.I admonish him, but he will not regard me; -When he is overthrown, he will think of me."
