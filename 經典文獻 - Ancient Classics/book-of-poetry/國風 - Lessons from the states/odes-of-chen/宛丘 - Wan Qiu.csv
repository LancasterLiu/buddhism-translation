子之湯兮、宛丘之上兮。洵有情兮、而無望兮。,"How gay and dissipated you are,There on the top of Wanqiu!You are full of kindly affection indeed,But you have nothing to make you looked up to!"
坎其擊鼓、宛丘之下。無冬無夏、值其鷺羽。,"How your blows on the drum resound,At the foot of Wanqiu!Be it winter, be it summer,You are holding your egret's feather!"
坎其擊缶、宛丘之道。無冬無夏、值其鷺翿。,"How you beat your earthen vessel,On the way to Wanqiu!Be it winter, be it summer,You are holding your egret-fan!"
