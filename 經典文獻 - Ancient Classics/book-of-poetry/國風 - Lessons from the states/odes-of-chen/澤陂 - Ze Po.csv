彼澤之陂、有蒲與荷。有美一人、傷如之何。寤寐無為、涕泗滂沱。,"By the shores of that marsh,There are rushes and lotus plants.There is the beautiful lady; -I am tortured for her, but what avails it?Waking or sleeping, I do nothing;From my eyes and nose the water streams."
彼澤之陂、有蒲與蕑。有美一人、碩大且卷。寤寐無為、中心悁悁。,"By the shores of that marsh,There are rushes and the valerian.There is the beautiful lady;Tall and large, and elegant.Waking or sleeping, I do nothing;My inmost heart is full of grief."
彼澤之陂、有蒲菡萏。有美一人、碩大且儼。寤寐無為、輾轉伏枕。,"By the shores of that marsh,There are rushes and lotus flowers.There is the beautiful lady;Tall and large, and majestic.Waking or sleeping, I do nothing;On my side, on my back, with my face on the pillow, I lie."
