園有桃、其實之殽。心之憂矣、我歌且謠。不我知者、謂我士也驕。彼人是哉、子曰何其。心之憂矣、其誰知之。其誰知之、蓋亦勿思。,"Of the peach trees in the garden,The fruit may be used as food.My heart is grieved,And I play and sing.Those who do not know me,Say I am a scholar venting his pride.'Those men are right;What do you mean by your words?'My heart is grieved;Who knows [the cause of] it?Who knows [the cause of] it?[They know it not], because they will not think."
園有棘、其實之食。心之憂矣、聊以行國。不我知者、謂我士也罔極。彼人是哉、子曰何其。心之憂矣、其誰知之。其誰知之、蓋亦勿思。,"Of the jujube trees in the garden,The fruit may be used as food.My heart is grieved,And I think I must travel about through the State.Those who do not know me,Say I am an officer going to the verge of license.' Those men are right;What do you mean by your words? 'My heart is grieved;Who knows [the cause of] it?Who knows [the cause of] it?[They do not know it], because they will not think."
