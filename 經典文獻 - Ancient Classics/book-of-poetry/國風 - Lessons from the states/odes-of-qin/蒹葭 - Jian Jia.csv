蒹葭蒼蒼、白露為霜。所謂伊人、在水一方。遡洄從之、道阻且長。遡遊從之、宛在水中央。,"The reeds and rushes are deeply green,And the white dew is turned into hoarfrost.The man of whom I think,Is somewhere about the water.I go up the stream in quest of him,But the way is difficult and long.I go down the stream in quest of him,And lo! he is right in the midst of the water."
蒹葭淒淒、白露未晞。所謂伊人、在水之湄。遡洄從之、道阻且躋。遡遊從之、宛在水中坻。,"The reeds and rushes are luxuriant,And the white dew is not yet dry.The man of whom I think,Is on the margin of the water.I go up the stream in quest of him,But the way is difficult and steep.I go down the stream in quest of him,And lo! he is on the islet in the midst of the water."
蒹葭采采、白露未已。所謂伊人、在水之涘。遡洄從之、道阻且右。遡遊從之、宛在水中沚。,"The reeds and rushes are abundant,And the white dew is not yet ceased.The man of whom I think,Is on the bank of the river.I go up the stream in quest of him,But the way is difficult and turns to the right.I go down the stream in quest of him,And lo! he is on the island in the midst of the water."
