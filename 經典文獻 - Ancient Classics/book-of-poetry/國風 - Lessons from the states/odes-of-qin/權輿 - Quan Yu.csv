於我乎、夏屋渠渠、今也每食無餘。于嗟乎、不承權輿。,He assigned us a house large and spacious;But now at every meal there is nothing left.Alas that he could not continue as he began!
於我乎、每食四簋、今也每食不飽。于嗟乎、不承權輿。,He assigned us at every meal four dishes of grain;But now at every meal we do not get our fill.Alas that he could not continue as he began!
