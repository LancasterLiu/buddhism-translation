鴥彼晨風、鬱彼北林。未見君子、憂心欽欽。如何如何、忘我實多。,"Swift flies the falcon,To the thick-wooded forest in the north.While I do not see my husband,My heart cannot forget its grief.How is it, how is it,That he forgets me so very much?"
山有苞櫟、隰有六駮。未見君子、憂心靡樂。如何如何、忘我實多。,"On the mountain are the bushy oaks;In the low wet grounds are six elms.While I do not see my husband,My sad heart has no joy.How is it, how is it,That he forgets me so very much?"
山有苞棣、隰有樹檖。未見君子、憂心如醉。如何如何、忘我實多。,"On the mountain are the bushy sparrow-plums;In the low wet grounds are the high, wild pear trees.While I do not see my husband,My heart is as if intoxicated with grief.How is it, how is it,That he forgets me so very much?"
