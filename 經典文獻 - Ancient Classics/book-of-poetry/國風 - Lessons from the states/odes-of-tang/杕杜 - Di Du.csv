有杕之杜、其葉湑湑。獨行踽踽。豈無他人、不如我同父。嗟行之人、胡不比焉。人無兄弟、胡不佽焉。,"There is a solitary russet pear tree,[But] its leaves are luxuriant.Alone I walk unbefriended; -Is it because there are no other people?But none are like the sons of one's father.O ye travellers,Why do ye not sympathize with me?Without brothers as I am,Why do ye not help me?"
有杕之杜、其葉菁菁。獨行睘睘。豈無他人、不如我同姓。嗟行之人、胡不比焉。人無兄弟、胡不佽焉。,"There is a solitary russet pear tree,[But] its leaves are abundant.Alone I walk uncared for; -Is it that there are not other people?But none are like those of one's own surname.O ye travellers,Why do ye not sympathize with me?Without brothers as I am,Why do ye not help me?"
