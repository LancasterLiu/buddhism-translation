大車檻檻、毳衣如菼。豈不爾思、畏子不敢。,"His great carriage rumbles along,And his robes of rank glitter like the young sedge.Do I not think of you?But I am afraid of this officer, and dare not."
大車啍啍、毳衣如璊。豈不爾思、畏子不奔。,"His great carriage moves heavily and slowly,And his robes of rank glitter like a carnation-gem.Do I not think of you?But I am afraid of this officer, and do not rush to you."
穀則異室、死則同穴。謂予不信、有如皦日。,"While living, we may have to occupy different apartments;But when dead, we shall share the same grave.If you say that I am not sincere,By the bright sun I swear that I am."
