簡兮簡兮、方將萬舞。日之方中、在前上處。,"Easy and indifferent! easy and indifferent!I am ready to perform in all dances,Then when the sun is in the meridian,There in that conspicious place."
碩人俁俁、公庭萬舞。有力如虎、執轡如組。,"With my large figure,I dance in the ducal courtyard.I am strong [also] as a tiger;The reins are in my grasp like ribbons."
左手執籥、右手秉翟。赫如渥赭、公言錫爵。,In my left hand I grasp a flute;In my right I hold a pheasant's feather.I am red as if I were rouged;The duke gives me a cup [of spirits].
山有榛、隰有苓。云誰之思、西方美人。彼美人兮、西方之人兮。,"The hazel grows on the hills,And the liquorice in the marshes.Of whom are my thoughts?Of the fine men of the west.O those fine men!Those men of the west!"
