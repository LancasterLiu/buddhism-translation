北風其涼、雨雪其雱。惠而好我、攜手同行。其虛其邪、既亟只且。,"Cold blows the north wind;Thick falls the snow.Ye who love and regard me,Let us join hands and go together.Is it a time for delay?The urgency is extreme!"
北風其喈、雨雪其霏。惠而好我、攜手同歸。其虛其邪、既亟只且。,"The north wind whistles;The snow falls and drifts about.Ye who love and regard me,Let us join hands, and go away for ever.Is it a time for delay?The urgency is extreme!"
莫赤匪狐、莫黑匪烏。惠而好我、攜手同車。其虛其邪、既亟只且。,"Nothing red is seen but foxes,Nothing black but crows.Ye who love and regard me,Let us join hands, and go together in our carriages.Is it a time for delay?The urgency is extreme!"
