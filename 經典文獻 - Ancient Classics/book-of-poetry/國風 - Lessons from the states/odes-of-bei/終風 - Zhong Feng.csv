終風且暴、顧我則笑。謔浪笑敖、中心是悼。,"The wind blows and is fierce,He looks at me and smiles,With scornful words and dissolute, - the smile of pride.To the center of my heart I am grieved."
終風且霾、惠然肯來。莫往莫來、悠悠我思。,"The wind blows, with clouds of dust.Kindly he seems to be willing to come to me;[But] he neither goes nor comes.Long, long, do I think of him."
終風且曀、不日有曀。寤言不寐、願言則嚏。,"The wind blew, and the sky was cloudy;Before a day elapses, it is cloudy again.I awake, and cannot sleep;I think of him, and gasp."
曀曀其陰、虺虺其靁。寤言不寐、願言則懷。,"All cloudy is the darkness,And the thunder keeps muttering.I awake and cannot sleep;I think of him, and my breast is full of pain."
