汎彼柏舟、亦汎其流。耿耿不寐、如有隱憂。微我無酒、以敖以遊。,"It floats about, that boat of cypress wood;Yea, it floats about on the current.Disturbed am I and sleepless,As if suffering from a painful wound.It is not because I have no wine,And that I might not wander and saunder about."
我心匪鑒、不可以茹。亦有兄弟、不可以據。薄言往愬、逢彼之怒。,"My mind is not a mirror; -It cannot [equally] receive [all impressions].I, indeed, have brothers,But I cannot depend on them,I meet with their anger."
我心匪石、不可轉也。我心匪席、不可卷也。威儀棣棣、不可選也。,"My mind is not a stone; -It cannot be rolled about.My mind is not a mat; -It cannot be rolled up.My deportment has been dignified and good,With nothing wrong which can be pointed out."
憂心悄悄、慍于群小。覯閔既多、受侮不少。靜言思之、寤辟有摽。,"My anxious heart is full of trouble;I am hated by the herd of mean creatures;I meet with many distresses;I receive insults not a few.Silently I think of my case,And, starting as from sleep, I beat my breast."
日居月諸、胡迭而微。心之憂矣、如匪澣衣。靜言思之、不能奮飛。,"There are the sun and moon, -How is it that the former has become small, and not the latter?The sorrow cleaves to my heart,Like an unwashed dress.Silently I think of my case,But I cannot spread my wings and fly away."
