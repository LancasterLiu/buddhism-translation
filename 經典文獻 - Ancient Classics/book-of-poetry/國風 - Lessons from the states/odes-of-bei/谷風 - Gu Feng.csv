習習谷風、以陰以雨。黽勉同心、不宜有怒。采葑采菲、無以下體。德音莫違、及爾同死。,"Gently blows the east wind,With cloudy skies and with rain.[Husband and wife] should strive to be of the same mind,And not let angry feelings arise.When we gather the mustard plant and earth melons,We do not reject them because of their roots.While I do nothing contrary to my good name,I should live with you till our death."
行道遲遲、中心有違。不遠伊邇、薄送我畿。誰謂荼苦、其甘如薺。宴爾新昏、如兄如弟。,"I go along the road slowly, slowly,In my inmost heart reluctant.Not far, only a little way,Did he accompany me to the threshold.Who says that the sowthistle is bitter?It is as sweet as the shepherd's purse.You feast with your new wife,[Loving] as brothers."
涇以渭濁、湜湜其沚。宴爾新昏、不我屑以。毋逝我梁、毋發我笱。我躬不閱、遑恤我後。,"The muddiness of the Jing appears from the Wei,But its bottom may be seen about the islets.You feast with your new wife,And think me not worth being withDo not approach my dam,Do not move my basket.My person is rejected; -What avails it to care for what may come after?"
就其深矣、方之舟之。就其淺矣、泳之游之。何有何亡、黽勉求之。凡民有喪、匍匐救之。,"Where the water was deep,I crossed it by a raft or a boat.Where it was shallow,I dived or swam across it.Whether we had plenty or not,I exerted myself to be getting.When among others there was a death,I crawled on my knees to help them."
不我能慉、反以我為讎。既阻我德、賈用不售。昔育恐育鞫、及爾顛覆。既生既育、比予于毒。,"You cannot cherish me,And you even count me as an enemy.You disdain my virtues, -A pedlar's wares which do not sell.Formerly, I was afraid our means might be exhausted,And I might come with you to destitution.Now, when your means are abundant,You compare me to poison."
我有旨蓄、亦以御冬。宴爾新昏、以我御窮。有洸有潰、既詒我肄。不念昔者、伊余來塈。,"My fine collection of vegetables,Is but a provision against the winter.Feasting with your new wife,You think of me as a provision [only] against your poverty.Cavalierly and angrily you treat me;You give me only pain.You do not think of the former days,And are only angry with me."
