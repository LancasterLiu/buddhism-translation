載馳載驅、歸唁衛侯。驅馬悠悠、言至于漕。大夫跋涉、我心則憂。,"I would have galloped my horses and whipt them,Returning to condole with the marquis of Wei.I would have urged them all the long way,Till I arrived at Cao.A great officer has gone, over the hills and through the rivers;But my heart is full of sorrow."
既不我嘉、不能旋反。視爾不臧、我思不遠。既不我嘉、不能旋濟。視爾不臧、我思不閟。,"You disapproved of my [proposal],And I cannot return to [Wei];But I regard you as in the wrong,And cannot forget my purpose.You disapproved of my purpose,But I cannot return across the streams;But I regard you as in the wrong,And cannot shut out my thoughts."
陟彼阿丘、言采其蝱。女子善懷、亦各有行。許人尤之、眾穉且狂。,"I will ascend that mound with the steep side,And gather the mother-of-pearl lilies.I might, as a woman, have many thoughts,But every one of them was practicable.The people of Xu blame me,But they are all childish and hasty [in their conclusions]."
我行其野、芃芃其麥。控于大邦、誰因誰極。大夫君子、無我有尤。百爾所思、不如我所之。,"I would have gone through the country,Amidst the wheat so luxuriant.I would have carried the case before the great State.On whom should I have relied? Who would come [to the help of Wei]?Ye great officers and gentlemen,Do not condemn me.The hundred plans you think ofAre not equal to the course I was going to take."
