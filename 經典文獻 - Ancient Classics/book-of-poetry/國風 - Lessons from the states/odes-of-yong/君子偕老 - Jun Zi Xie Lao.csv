君子偕老、副笄六珈。委委佗佗、如山如河、象服是宜。子之不淑、云如之何。,"The husband's to their old age,In her headdress, and the cross-pins, with their six jewels;Easy and elegant in her movements;[Stately] as a mountain, [majestic]as a river,Well beseeming her pictured robes:[But] with your want of virtue, O lady,What have you to do with these things?"
玼兮玼兮、其之翟也。鬒髮如云、不屑髢也。玉之瑱也、象之揥也、揚且之皙也。胡然而天也、胡然而帝也。,"How rich and splendidIs her pheasant-figured robe!Her black hair in masses like clouds,No false locks does she descend to.There are her ear-plugs of jade,Her comb-pin of ivory,And her high forehead, so white.She appears like a visitant from heaven!She appears like a goddess!"
瑳兮瑳兮、其之展也。蒙彼縐絺、是紲袢也。子之清揚、揚且之顏也。展如之人兮、邦之媛也。,"How rich and splendidIs her robe of state!It is worn over the finest muslin of dolichos,The more cumbrous and warm garment being removed.Clear are her eyes; fine is her forehead;Full are her temples.Ah! such a woman as this!The beauty of the country!"
