伐柯如何、匪斧不克。取妻如何、匪媒不得。,"In hewing [the wood for] an axe-handle, how do you proceed?Without [another] axe it cannot be done.In taking a wife, how do you proceed?Without a go-between it cannot be done."
伐柯伐柯、其則不遠。我覯之子、籩豆有踐。,"In hewing an axe-handle, in hewing an axe-handle,The pattern is not far off.I see the lady,And forthwith the vessels are arranged in rows."
