野有死麕、白茅包之。有女懷春、吉士誘之。,"In the wild there is a dead antelope,And it is wrapped up with the white grass.There is a young lady with thoughts natural to the spring,And a fine gentleman would lead her astray."
林有樸樕、野有死鹿。白茅純束、有女如玉。,"In the forest there are the scrubby oaks;In the wild there is a dead deer,And it is bound round with the white grass.There is a young lady like a gem."
舒而脫脫兮、無感我帨兮、無使尨也吠。,"[She says], Slowly; gently, gently;Do not move my handkerchief;Do not make my dog bark."
