蜉蝣之羽、衣裳楚楚。心之憂矣、於我歸處。,"The wings of the ephemera,Are robes, bright and splendid.My heart is grieved; -Would they but come and abide with me!"
蜉蝣之翼、采采衣服。心之憂矣、於我歸息。,"The wings of the ephemera,Are robes, variously adorned.My heart is grieved; -Would they but come and rest with me!"
蜉蝣掘閱、麻衣如雪。心之憂矣、於我歸說。,"The ephemera bursts from its hole,With a robe of hemp like snow.My heart is grieved; -Would they but come and lodge with me!"
