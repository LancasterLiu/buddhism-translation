匪風發兮、匪車偈兮、顧瞻周道、中心怛兮。,"Not for the violence of the wind;Not for a rushing motion of a chariot; -But when I look to the road to Zhou,Am I pained to the core of my heart."
匪風飄兮、匪車嘌兮。顧瞻周道、中心弔兮。,"Not for the whirlwind;Not for the irregular motion of a chariot; -But when I look to the road to Zhou,Am I sad to the core of my heart."
誰能亨魚、溉之釜鬵。誰將西歸、懷之好音。,Who can cook fish?I will wash his boilers for him.Who will loyally go to the west?I will cheer him with good words.
