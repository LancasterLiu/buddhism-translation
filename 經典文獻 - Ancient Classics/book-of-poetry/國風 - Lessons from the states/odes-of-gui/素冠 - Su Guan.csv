庶見素冠兮、棘人欒欒兮、勞心慱慱兮。,"If I could but see the white cap,And the earnest mourner worn to leanness! -My toiled heart is worn with grief!"
庶見素衣兮、我心傷悲兮、聊與子同歸兮。,If I could but see the white [lower] dress! -My heart is wounded with sadness!I should be inclined to go and live with the wearer!
庶見素韠兮、我心蘊結兮、聊與子如一兮。,If I could but see the white knee-covers! -Sorrow is knotted in my heart!I should almost feel as of one soul with the wearer!
