羔裘逍遙、狐裘以朝。豈不爾思、勞心忉忉。,In your lamb's fur you saunter about;In your fox's fur you hold your court.How should I not think anxiously about you?My toiled heart is full of grief.
羔裘翱翔、狐裘在堂。豈不爾思、我心憂傷。,In your lamb's fur you wander aimlessly about;In your fox's fur you appear in your hall.How should I not think anxiously about you?My heart is wounded with sorrow.
羔裘如膏、日出有曜。豈不爾思、中心是悼。,"Your lamb's fur, as if covered with ointment;Glistens when the sun comes forth.How should I not think anxiously about you?To the core of my heart I am grieved."
