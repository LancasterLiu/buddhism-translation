籊籊竹竿、以釣于淇。豈不爾思、遠莫致之。,"With your long and tapering bamboo rods,You angle in the Qi.Do I not think of you?But I am far away, and cannot get to you."
泉源在左、淇水在右。女子有行、遠兄弟父母。,"The Quanyuan is on the left,And the waters of the Qi are on the right.But when a young lady goes away, [and is married],She leaves her brothers and parents."
淇水在右、泉源在左。巧笑之瑳、佩玉之儺。,The waters of the Qi are on the rightAnd the Quanyuan is on the left.How shine the white teeth through the artful smiles!How the girdle gems move to the measured steps!
淇水滺滺、檜楫松舟。駕言出遊、以寫我憂。,"The waters of the Qi flow smoothly;There are the oars of cedar and boats of pine.Might I but go there in my carriage and ramble,To dissipate my sorrow!"
