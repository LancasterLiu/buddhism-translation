瞻彼淇奧、綠竹如簀。有匪君子、如金如錫、如圭如璧。寬兮綽兮、猗重較兮。善戲謔兮、不為虐兮。,"Look at those recesses in the banks of the Qi,With their green bamboos, so dense together!There is our elegant and accomplished prince, -[Pure] as gold or as tin,[Soft and rich] as a sceptre of jade!How magnanimous is he and gentle!There he is in his chariot with its two high sides!Skilful is he at quips and jokes,But how does he keep from rudeness in them!"
