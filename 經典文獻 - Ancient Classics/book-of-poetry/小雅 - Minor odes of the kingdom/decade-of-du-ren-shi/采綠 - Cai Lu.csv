終朝采綠、不盈一匊。予髮曲局、薄言歸沐。,"All the morning I gather the king-grass,And do not collect enough to fill my hands.My hair is in a wisp; -I will go home and wash it."
終朝采藍、不盈一襜。五日為期，六日不詹。,"All the morning I gather the indigo plant,And do not collect enough to fill my apron.Five days was the time agreed on; -It is the sixth, and I do not see him."
之子于狩，言韔其弓。之子于釣，言綸之繩。,"When he went a hunting,I put the bow in its case for him.When he went to fish,I arranged his line for him."
其釣維何，維魴及鱮。維魴及鱮，薄言觀者。,"What did he take in angling?Bream and tench; -Bream and tench,While people [looked on] to see."
