我行其野、蔽芾其樗。昏姻之故、言就爾居。爾不我畜、復我邦家。,"I travelled through the country,Where the Fetid tree grew luxuriant.Because of our affinity by marriage,I went to reside with you.But you do not entertain me;And I go back to my country and clan."
我行其野、言采其蓫。昏姻之故、言就爾宿。爾不我畜、言歸思復。,"I travelled through the country,Gathering the sheep's-foot.Because of our affinity by marriage,I came to lodge with you.But you do not entertain me;And I will return, I will go back."
我行其野、言采其葍。不思舊姻、求爾新特。成不以富、亦祇以異。,"I travelled through the country,Gathering the pokeweed.You do not think of our old affinity,And seek to please your new relative.If indeed you are not influenced by her riches,You still are so by the difference [between the new and the old]."
