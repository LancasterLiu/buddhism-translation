皇皇者華、于彼原隰。駪駪征夫、每懷靡及。,"Brilliant are the flowers,On those level heights and the low grounds.Complete and alert is the messenger, with his suite,Ever anxious lest he should not succeed."
我馬維駒、六轡如濡。載馳載驅、周爰咨諏。,"My horses are young;The six reins look as if they were moistened.I gallop them, and urge them on,Everywhere pushing my inquiries."
我馬維騏、六轡如絲。載馳載驅、周爰咨謀。,"My horses are piebald;The six reins are like silk.I gallop them, and urge them on,Everywhere seeking information and counsel."
我馬維駱、六轡沃若。載馳載驅、周爰咨度。,"My horses are white and black-maned;The six reins look glossy.I gallop them, and urge them on,Everywhere seeking information and advice."
我馬維駰、六轡既均。載馳載驅、周爰咨詢。,"My horses are grey;The six reins are well in hand.I gallop them, and urge them on,Everywhere seeking information and suggestions."
