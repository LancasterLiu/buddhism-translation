薄言采芑、于彼新田、于此菑畝。方叔涖止、其車三千、師干之試。方叔率止、乘其四騏、四騏翼翼。路車有奭、簟笰魚服、鉤膺鞗革。,"They were gathering the white millet,In those new fields,And in these acres brought only one year under cultivation,When Fang Shu came to take the command.His chariots were three thousand,With a host of well-disciplined warriors.Fang Shu led them on,In his carriage drawn by four piebalds,Four piebalds orderly moving.Red shone his grand carriage,With its chequered bamboo screen, and seal-skin quivers,With the hooks for the trappings of the breast-bands, and the rein-ends."
薄言采芑、于彼新田、于此中鄉。方叔涖止、其車三千、旂旐央央。方叔率止、約軝錯衡、八鸞瑲瑲。服其命服、朱芾斯皇、有瑲蔥珩。,"They were gathering the white millet,In those new fields,And all about these villages,When Fang Shu came to take the command.His chariots were three thousand;His banners, with their blazonry of dragons, and of serpents and tortoises, fluttered gaily.Fang Shu led them on,The naves of his wheels bound with leather, and his yoke ornamented.Tinkle-tinkle went the eight bells at the horses' bits.He wore the robes conferred [by the king];His red knee-covers were resplendent,And the gems of his girdle-pendant sounding."
鴥彼飛隼、其飛戾天、亦集爰止。方叔涖止、其車三千、師干之試。方叔率止、鉦人伐鼓、陳師鞠旅。顯允方叔、伐鼓淵淵、振旅闐闐。,"Rapid is the flight of the hawk,Soaring to the heavens,And again descending and settling in its place.Fang Shu came to take the command.His chariots were three thousand,With a host of well disciplined warriors.Fang Shu led them on.With his jinglers and drummers,He marshalled his hosts and addressed them.Intelligent and true is Fang Shu,Deep rolled the sound of his drums;With a lighter sound he led the troops back."
蠢爾蠻荊、大邦為讎。方叔元老、克壯其猶。方叔率止、執訊獲醜。戎車嘽嘽、嘽嘽焞焞、如霆如雷。顯允方叔、征伐玁狁、蠻荊來威。,"Foolish were the savage tribes of Jing,Presuming to oppose our great region.Fang Shu is of great age,But full of vigour were his plans.He led his army on,Seized [the chiefs] for the question, and made captives of a crowd [besides].Numerous were his war chariots,Numerous and in grand array,Like the clap or the roll of thunder their onset.Intelligent and true is Fang Shu.He had gone and smitten the Xian-yun,And the tribes of King came, awed by his majesty."
