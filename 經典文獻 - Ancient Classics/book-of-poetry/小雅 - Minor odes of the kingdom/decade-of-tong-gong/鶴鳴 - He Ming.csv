鶴鳴于九皋、聲聞于野。魚潛在淵、或在于渚。樂彼之園、爰有樹檀、其下維蘀。它山之石、可以為錯。,"The crane cries in the ninth pool of the marsh,And her voice is heard in the [distant] wilds.The fish lies in the deep,And now is by the islet.Pleasant is that garden,In which are the sandal trees;But beneath them are only withered leaves.The stones of those hills,May be made into grind-stones."
鶴鳴于九皋、聲聞于天。魚在于渚、或潛在淵。樂彼之園、爰有樹檀、其下維穀。它山之石、可以攻玉。,"The crane cries in the ninth pool of the marsh,And her voice is heard in the sky.The fish is by the islet,And now it lies hid in the deep.Pleasant is that garden,In which are the sandal trees;But beneath them is the paper-mulberry tree,The stones of those hills,May be used to polish gems."
