夜如何其、夜未央、庭燎之光。君子至止、鸞聲將將。,How goes the night?It is not yet midnight.The torch is blazing in the court-yard.My princely men are arriving; -There is the tinkling of their bells.
夜如何其、夜未艾、庭燎晣晣。君子至止、鸞聲噦噦。,"How goes the night?The night is not yet through.The torch is growing pale in the court-yard.My princely men are arriving; -There is the sound of their bells, regular and near."
夜如何其、夜鄉晨、庭燎有輝。君子至止、言觀其旂。,How goes the night?It is getting towards morning.The torch is smoking in the court-yard.My princely men are arriving; -I see their banners.
