有頍者弁、實維伊何。爾酒既旨、爾殽既嘉。豈伊異人、兄弟匪他。蔦與女蘿、施于松柏。未見君子、憂心弈弈。既見君子、庶幾說懌。,"Those in the leather caps, -Who are they?Since your spirits are [so] good,And your viands are [so] fine,How can they be strangers?They are your brethren, and no others.[They are like] the mistletoe and the dodder.Growing over the pine and the cypress.While they do not see you, O king,Their sorrowful hearts are all-unsettled.When they do see you,They begin to be happy and glad."
有頍者弁、實維何期。爾酒既旨、爾殽既時。豈伊異人、兄弟具來。蔦與女蘿、施于松上。未見君子、憂心怲怲。既見君子、庶幾有臧。,"Those in the leather caps, -Who are they?Since your spirits are [so]good,And your viands are all of the season.How can they be strangers?They are your brethren, all assembled.[They are like] the mistletoe and the dodder.Growing over the pine.While they do not see you, O king,Their hearts are full of sorrow.When they do see you,They begin to feel that things are right."
有頍者弁、實維在首。爾酒既旨、爾殽既阜。豈伊異人、兄弟甥舅。如彼雨雪、先集維霰。死喪無日、無幾相見。樂酒今夕、君子維宴。,"There are those in the leather caps,Which they wear on their heads.Since your spirits are [so] good,And your viands are [so] abundant,How can they be strangers?They are your brethren, and your relatives by affinity.When there is going to be a fall of snow,There is first the descent of sleet.Death and ruin may come any day,It is not long that you will see one another.Rejoice over your spirits for the present evening;O king, enjoy the feast."
