騂騂角弓、翩其反矣。兄弟昏姻、無胥遠矣。,"Well fashioned is the bow adorned with horn,And swift is its recoil.Brothers and relatives by affinity,Should not be treated distantly."
爾之遠矣、民胥然矣。爾之教矣、民胥傚矣。,"When you keep yours at a distance,The people all do the same with theirs.What you teach,The people all imitate."
此令兄弟、綽綽有裕。不令兄弟、交相為瘉。,"Those brothers who are good,Continue to display much generous feeling;But between brothers who are not good,Their intercourse is marked by troubles."
民之無良、相怨一方。受爵不讓、至于已斯亡。,"People who have no conscience,Repine against each other, each one holding his own point of view;One gets a place, and shows no humility -Till they all come to ruin."
老馬反為駒、不顧其後。如食宜饇、如酌孔取。,"An old horse, notwithstanding, thinks himself a colt,And has no regard to the future.It is like craving a superabundance of food,And an excess of drink."
毋教猱升木、如塗塗附。君子有徽猷、小人與屬。,"Do not teach a monkey to climb trees; -[You act] like adding mud to one in the mud.If the sovereign have good ways,The small people will accord with them."
雨雪瀌瀌、見晛曰消。莫肯下遺、式居婁驕。,"The snow may have fallen abundantly,But when it feels the sun's heat, it dissolves.You are not willing to discountenance [those parties],And so they become [more] troublesome and arrogant."
雨雪浮浮、見晛曰流。如蠻如髦、我是用憂。,"The snow may have fallen largely,But when it feels the sun's heat, it flows away.They become like the Man or the Mao; -This is what make me sad."
