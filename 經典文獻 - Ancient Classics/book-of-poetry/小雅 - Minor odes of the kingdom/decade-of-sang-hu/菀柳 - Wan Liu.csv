有菀者柳、不尚息焉。上帝甚蹈、無自暱焉。俾予靖之、後予極焉。,"There is a luxuriant willow tree; -Who would not wish to rest [under it]?[But this] god is very changeable; -Do not approach him.If I were to [try and] order his affairs,His demands afterwards would be extreme."
有菀者柳、不尚愒焉。上帝甚蹈、無自瘵焉。俾予靖之、後予邁焉。,"There is a luxuriant willow tree; -Who would not wish to take shelter [under it]?[But this] god is very changeable,Do not get yourself into trouble with him.If I were to [try and] order his affairs,His demands on me afterwards would be beyond measure."
有鳥高飛、亦傅于天。彼人之心、于何其臻。曷予靖之、居以凶矜。,"There is a bird flying high,Even up to heaven.The heart of that man, -To what will it proceed?Why should I [try to] order his affairs?I should only find myself in pitiable misery."
