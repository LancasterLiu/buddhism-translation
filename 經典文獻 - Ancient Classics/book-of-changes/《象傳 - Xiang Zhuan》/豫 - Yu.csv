雷出地奮，豫。先王以作樂崇德，殷薦之上帝，以配祖考。,"(The trigrams for) the earth and thunder issuing from it with its crashing noise form Yu. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, composed their music and did honour to virtue, presenting it especially and most grandly to God, when they associated with Him (at the service) their highest ancestor and their father."
初六鳴豫，志窮凶也。,'The (subject of the) first six proclaims his pleasure and satisfaction:' - there will be evil; his wishes have been satisfied to overflowing.
不終日，貞吉；以中正也。,'(He sees a thing) without waiting till it has come to pass; with his firm correctness there will be good fortune:' - this is shown by the central and correct position (of the line).
盱豫有悔，位不當也。,"'He looks up (for favours), while he indulges the feeling of satisfaction; there will be occasion for repentance:' - this is intimated by the position not being the appropriate one."
由豫，大有得；志大行也。,'From him the harmony and satisfaction come; great is the success which he obtains:' - his aims take effect on a grand scale.
六五貞疾，乘剛也。恆不死，中未亡也。,"'(The subject of) the fifth six has a chronic complaint:' - this is shown by his being mounted on the strong (line). 'He still lives on without dying:' - he is in the central position, (and its memories of the past) have not yet perished."
冥豫在上，何可長也。,"'With darkened mind devoted to the harmony and satisfaction (of the time),' as shown in the topmost (line): - how can one in such a condition continue long?"
