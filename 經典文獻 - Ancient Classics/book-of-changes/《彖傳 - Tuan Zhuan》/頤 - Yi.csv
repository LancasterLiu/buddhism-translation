頤貞吉，養正則吉也。觀頤，觀其所養也；自求口實，觀其自養也。天地養萬物，聖人養賢，以及萬民；頤之時大矣哉！,"'Yi indicates that with firm correctness there will be good fortune:' - when the nourishing is correct, there will be good fortune. 'We must look at what we are seeking to nourish:' - we must look at those whom we wish to nourish. 'We must by the exercise of our thoughts seek the proper aliment:' - we must look to our own nourishing of ourselves. Heaven and earth nourish all things. The sages nourish men of talents and virtue, by them to reach to the myriads of the people. Great is (the work intended by this) nourishing in its time!"
