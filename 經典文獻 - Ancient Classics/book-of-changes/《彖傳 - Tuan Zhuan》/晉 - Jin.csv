晉，進也。明出地上，順而麗乎大明，柔進而上行。是以康侯用錫馬蕃庶，晝日三接也。,"Jin denotes advancing. (In Jin we have) the bright (sun) appearing above the earth; (the symbol of) docile submission cleaving to that of the Great brightness; and the weak line advanced and moving above: - all these things give us the idea of 'a prince who secures the tranquillity (of the people), presented on that account with numerous horses (by the king), and three times in a day received at interviews.'"
