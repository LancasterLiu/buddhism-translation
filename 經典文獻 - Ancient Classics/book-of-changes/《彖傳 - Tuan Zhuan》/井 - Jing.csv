巽乎水而上水，井；井養而不窮也。改邑不改井，乃以剛中也。汔至亦未繘井，未有功也。羸其瓶，是以凶也。,"(We have the symbol of) wood in the water and the raising of the water; which (gives us the idea of) a well. A well supplies nourishment and is not (itself) exhausted. 'The site of a town may be changed, while the fashion of its wells undergoes no change:' - this is indicated by the central position of the strong lines (in the second and fifth places). 'The drawing is nearly accomplished, but the rope has not yet reached the water of the well:' - its service has not yet been accomplished. 'The bucket is broken:' - it is this that occasions evil."
