豫，剛應而志行，順以動，豫。豫，順以動，故天地如之，而況建侯行師乎？天地以順動，故日月不過，而四時不忒；聖人以順動，則刑罰清而民服。豫之時義大矣哉！,"In Yu we see the strong (line) responded to by all the others, and the will (of him whom it represents) being carried out; and (also) docile obedience employing movement (for its purposes). (From these things comes) Yu (the Condition of harmony and satisfaction). In this condition we have docile obedience employing movement (for its purposes), and therefore it is so as between heaven and earth; - how much more will it be so (among men) in 'the setting up of feudal princes and putting the hosts in motion!' Heaven and earth show that docile obedience in connexion with movement, and hence the sun and moon make no error (in time), and the four seasons do not deviate (from their order). The sages show such docile obedience in connexion with their movements, and hence their punishments and penalties are entirely just, and the people acknowledge it by their submission. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Yu!"
