大過，大者過也。棟橈，本末弱也。剛過而中，巽而說行，利有攸往，乃亨。大過之時大矣哉！,"Da Guo shows the great ones (= the undivided lines) in excess. In 'the beam that is weak' we see weakness both in the lowest and the topmost (lines). The strong lines are in excess, but (two of them) are in the central positions. The action (of the hexagram is represented by the symbols of) flexibility and satisfaction. (Hence it is said), 'There will be advantage in moving in any direction whatever; yea, there will be success. ' Great indeed is (the work to be done in) this very extraordinary time."
