今有一人，入人園圃，竊其桃李，眾聞則非之，上為政者得則罰之。此何也？以虧人自利也。至攘人犬豕雞豚者，其不義又甚入人園圃竊桃李。是何故也？以虧人愈多，其不仁茲甚，罪益厚。至入人欄廄，取人馬牛者，其不仁義又甚攘人犬豕雞豚。此何故也？以其虧人愈多。苟虧人愈多，其不仁茲甚，罪益厚。至殺不辜人也，扡其衣裘，取戈劍者，其不義又甚入人欄廄取人馬牛。此何故也？以其虧人愈多。苟虧人愈多，其不仁茲甚矣，罪益厚。當此，天下之君子1皆知而非之，謂之不義。今至大為攻國，則弗知非，從而譽之，謂之義。此可2謂知義與不義之別乎？,"Suppose a man enters the orchard of another and steals the other's peaches and plums. Hearing of it the public will condemn it; laying hold of him the authorities will punish him. Why? Because he injures others to profit himself. As to seizing dogs, pigs, chickens, and young pigs from another, it is even more unrighteous than to steal peaches and plums from his orchard. Why? Because it causes others to suffer more, and it is more inhumane and criminal. When it comes to entering another's stable and appropriating the other's horses and oxen, it is more inhumane than to seize the dogs, pigs, chickens, and young pigs of another. Why? Because others are caused to suffer more; when others are caused to suffer more, then the act is more inhumane and criminal. Finally, as to murdering the innocent, stripping him of his clothing, dispossessing him of his spear and sword, it is even more unrighteous than to enter another's stable and appropriate his horses and oxen. Why? Because it causes others to suffer more; when others are caused to suffer more, then the act is more inhumane and criminal. All the gentlemen of the world know that they should condemn these things, calling them unrighteous. But when it comes to the great attack of states, they do not know that they should condemn it. On the contrary, they applaud it, calling it righteous. Can this be said to be knowing the difference between righteousness and unrighteousness?1. 子 : Inserted.  孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》2. 可 : Originally read: ""何"". Corrected by 孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》"
殺一人謂之不義，必有一死罪矣，若以此說往，殺十人十重不義，必有十死罪矣；殺百人百重不義，必有百死罪矣。當此，天下之君子皆知而非之，謂之不義。今至大為不義攻國，則弗知1非，從而譽之，謂之義，情不知其不義也，故書其言以遺後世。若知其不義也，夫奚說書其不義以遺後世哉？今有人於此，少見黑曰黑，多見黑曰白，則以此人不知白黑之辯矣；少嘗苦曰苦，多嘗苦曰甘，則必以此人為不知甘苦之辯矣。今小為非，則知而非之。大為非攻國，則不知而2非，從而譽之，謂之義。此可謂知義與不義之辯乎？是以知天下之君子也，辯義與不義之亂也。,"The murder of one person is called unrighteous and incurs one death penalty. Following this argument, the murder of ten persons will be ten times as unrighteous and there should be ten death penalties; the murder of a hundred persons will be a hundred times as unrighteous and there should be a hundred death penalties. All the gentlemen of the world know that they should condemn these things, calling them unrighteous. But when it comes to the great unrighteousness of attacking states, they do not know that they should condemn it. On the contrary, they applaud it, calling it righteous. And they are really ignorant of its being unrighteous. Hence they have recorded their judgment to bequeath to their posterity. If they did know that it is unrighteous, then why would they record their false judgment to bequeath to posterity? Now, if there were a man who, upon seeing a little blackness, should say it is black, but, upon seeing much, should say it is white; then we should think he could not tell the difference between black and white. If, upon tasting a little bitterness one should say it is bitter, but, upon tasting much, should say it is sweet; then we should think he could not tell the difference between bitter and sweet. Now, when a little wrong is committed people know that they should condemn it, but when such a great wrong as attacking a state is committed people do not know that they should condemn it. On the contrary, it is applauded, called righteous. Can this be said to be knowing the difference between the righteous and the unrighteous? Hence we know the gentlemen of the world are confused about the difference between righteousness and unrighteousness.1. 知 : Originally read: ""之而"". 2. 而 : Deleted.  孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》"
子墨子言曰：「古者王公大人，為政於國家者，情欲譽之審，賞罰之當，刑政之不過失。」是故子墨子曰：「古者有語：『謀而不得，則以往知來，以見知隱』。謀若此，可得而知矣。」,"Mozi said: If the rulers of to-day sincerely wish to be careful in condemnation and commendation, judicious in rewards and punishments, and temperate in government and jurisdiction. Therefore Mozi said: There is an ancient saying that, when one is not successful in making out plans then predict the future by the past and learn about the absent from what is present. When one plans like this then one can be intelligent."
今師徒唯毋興起，冬行恐寒，夏行恐暑，此不可以冬夏為者也。春則廢民耕稼樹藝，秋則廢民穫斂。今唯毋廢一時，則百姓飢寒凍餒而死者，不可勝數。今嘗計軍上，竹箭羽旄幄幕，甲盾撥劫，往而靡壞腑爛不反者，不可勝數；又與矛戟戈劍乘車，其往則1碎折靡壞而不反者，不可勝數；與其牛馬肥而往，瘠而反，往死亡而不反者，不可勝數；與其涂道之脩遠，糧食輟絕而不繼，百姓死者，不可勝數也；與其居處之不安，食飲之不時，飢飽之不節，百姓之道疾病而死者，不可勝數；喪師多不可勝數，喪師盡不可勝計，則是鬼神之喪其主後，亦不可勝數。,"Now, about a country going to war. If it is in winter it will be too cold ; if it is in summer it will be too hot. So it should be neither in winter nor in summer. If it is in spring it will take people away from sowing and planting; if it is in autumn it will take people away from reaping and harvesting. Should they be taken away in either of these seasons, innumerable people would die of hunger and cold, And, when the army sets out, the bamboo arrows, the feather flags, the house tents, the armour, the shields, the sword hilts -- innumerable quantities of these will break and rot and never come back. The spears, the lances, the swords, the poniards, the chariots, the carts -- innumerable quantities of these will break and rot and never come back. Then innumerable horses and oxen will start out fat and come back lean or will not return at all. And innumerable people will die because their food will be cut off and cannot be supplied on account of the great distances of the roads. And innumerable people will be sick and die of the constant danger and the irregularity of eating and drinking and the extremes of hunger and over-eating. Then, the army will be lost in large numbers or entirely; in either case the number will be innumerable. And this means the spirits will lose their worshippers, and the number of these will also be innumerable.1. 往則 : Originally read: ""列住"". Corrected by 孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》"
國家發政，奪民之用，廢民之利，若此甚眾，然而何為為之？曰：「我貪伐勝之名，及得之利，故為之。」子墨子言曰：「計其所自勝，無所可用也。計其所得，反不如所喪者之多。今攻三里之城，七里之郭，攻此不用銳，且無殺而徒得此然也。殺人多必數於萬，寡必數於千，然後三里之城、七里之郭，且可得也。今萬乘之國，虛數於千，不勝而入廣衍數於萬，不勝而辟。然則土地者，所有餘也，士民者，所不足也。今盡士民之死，嚴下上之患，以爭虛城，則是棄所不足，而重所有餘也。為政若此，非國之務者也。」,"Why then does the government deprive the people of their opportunities and benefits to such a great extent? It has been answered: ""I covet the fame of the victor and the possessions obtainable through the conquest. So I do it."" Mozi said: But when we consider the victory as such, there is nothing useful about it. When we consider the possessions obtained through it, it does not even make up for the loss. Now about the siege of a city of three li or a guo of seven li -- if these could be obtained without the use of weapons or the killing of lives, it would be all right. But (as a matter of fact) those killed must be counted by the ten thousand, those widowed or left solitary must be counted by the thousand, before a city of three li or a guo of seven li could be captured. Moreover the states of ten thousand chariots now have empty towns to be counted by the thousand, which can be entered without conquest; and their extensive lands to be counted by the ten thousand (of mu), which can be cultivated without conquest. So, land is abundant but people are few. Now to pursue the people to death and aggravate the danger feared by both superiors and subordinates in order to obtain an empty city -- this is to give up what is needed and to treasure what is already in abundance. Such an undertaking is not in accordance with the interest of the country."
飾攻戰者言曰：「南則荊、吳之王，北則齊、晉之君，始封於天下之時，其土地之方，未至有數百里也；人徒之眾，未至有數十萬人也。以攻戰之故，土地之博至有數千里也；人徒之眾至有數百萬人。故當攻戰而不可為也。」子墨子言曰：「雖四五國則得利焉，猶謂之非行道也。譬若醫之藥人之有病者然。今有醫於此，和合其祝藥之于天下之有病者而藥之，萬人食此，若醫四五人得利焉，猶謂之非行藥也。故孝子不以食其親，忠臣不以食其君。古者封國於天下，尚者以耳之所聞，近者以目之所見，以攻戰亡者，不可勝數。何以知其然也？東方自莒之國者，其為國甚小，閒於大國之閒，不敬事於大，大國亦弗之從而愛利。是以東者越人夾削其壤地，西者齊人兼而有之。計莒之所以亡於齊越之間者，以是攻戰也。雖南者陳、蔡，其所以亡於吳越之閒者，亦以攻戰。雖北者且不一著何，其所以亡於燕、代、胡、貊之閒者，亦以攻戰也。」是故子墨子言曰：「古者王公大人，情欲得而惡失，欲安而惡危，故當攻戰而不可不非。」,"Those who endeavor to gloss over offensive wars would say: ""In the south there are the lords of Jing and Yue, and in the north there are the lords of Qi and Jin. When their states were first assigned to them, they were but a hundred li square in area, and but a few tens of thousands in number of people. By means of wars and attacks, their areas have increased to several thousand li square and the people to several million. So, then, offensive wars are not to be condemned."" Mozi said : The four or five states may have reaped their benefits, still it is not conduct according to the Dao. It is like the physician giving his drugs to the patients. If a physician should give all the sick in the world a uniform drug, among the ten thousand who took it there might be four or five who were benefited, still it is not to be said to be a common (commonly beneficial) medicine. Thus a filial son will not give it to his parent and a loyal minister will not give it to his king. After the empire was in the ancient time divided into states a great many of them died of attacks - the earlier cases we hear of through the ear, the recent cases we saw by the eye. How do we know it is so? In the east there was the state of Ju. It was a small state situated in the midst of big states. It did not show respect and obedience to the big states, and the latter therefore did not like it or favour it. So, on the east Yue cut and appropriated its land by force, and from the west Qi swallowed it up altogether. And it was due to offensive wars that Ju died between two big states. And it was due to offensive war too that in the south Chen and Cai were extinguished by Wu and Yue. And it was also due to offensive wars that in the north Bu Tu He perished among Yan, Dai, Hu and Mo. Therefore Mozi said: If the rulers now really desire gain and avert loss, desire security and avert danger, they cannot but condemn offensive wars."
飾攻戰者之言曰：「彼不能收用彼眾，是故亡。我能收用我眾，以此攻戰於天下，誰敢不賓服哉？」子墨子言曰：「子雖能收用子之眾，子豈若古者吳闔閭哉？古者吳闔閭教七年，奉甲執兵，奔三百里而舍焉，次注林，出於冥隘之徑，戰於柏舉，中楚國而朝宋與及魯。至夫差之身，北而攻齊，舍於汶上，戰於艾陵，大敗齊人而葆之大山；東而攻越，濟三江五湖，而葆之會稽。九夷之國莫不賓服。於是退不能賞孤，施舍群萌，自恃其力，伐其功，譽其智，怠於教，遂築姑蘇之臺，七年不成。及若此，則吳有離罷之心。越王句踐視吳上下不相得，收其眾以復其讎，入北郭，徙大內，圍王宮而吳國以亡。昔者晉有六將軍，而智伯莫為強焉。計其土地之博，人徒之眾，欲以抗諸侯，以為英名。攻戰之速，故差論其爪牙之士，皆列其1舟車之眾，以攻中行氏而有之。以其謀為既已足矣，又攻茲范氏而大敗之，并三家以為一家，而不止，又圍趙襄子於晉陽。及若此，則韓、魏亦相從而謀曰：『古者有語，脣亡則齒寒』。趙氏朝亡，我夕從之，趙氏夕；亡，我朝從之。《詩》曰『魚水不務，陸將何及乎！』」是以三主之君，一心戮力辟門除道，奉甲興士，韓、魏自外，趙氏自內，擊智伯大敗之。」是故子墨子言曰：「古者有語曰：『君子不鏡於水而鏡於人，鏡於水，見面之容，鏡於人，則知吉與凶。今以攻戰為利，則蓋嘗鑒之於智伯之事乎？此其為不吉而凶，既可得而知矣。』」,"Those who endeavor to gloss over offensive wars would say: ""These states perished because they could not gather and employ their multitudes. I can gather and employ my multitudes and wage war with them; who, then, dares to be unsubmissive?"" Mozi said: You might be able to gather and employ your multitudes, but can you compare yourself with the ancient He Lu of Wu? He Lu of Wu (about 510 B.C.) in the ancient days drilled his soldiers seven years. With armour on and weapons in hand they could cover three hundred li (in a day) before encamping (for the night). Passing Zhulin, they emerged at the narrow Pass of Min. They engaged in battle (with the state of Chu) at Boju. Subduing Chu, (He Lu) gave audience to Song and Lu. By the time of Fu Chai he attacked Qi in the north, encamped on the Wen River, fought at Ai Ling and greatly defeated Qi and compelled surety from them at Mt.Tai. In the east he attacked Yue, crossing the Three Rivers and the Five Lakes, and compelled surety at Guiji. None of the nine tribes dared to show disrespect. Reaching home, however, he would not reward the orphaned or give to the numerous rustics. He depended on his own might, gloated over his success, praised his own cleverness, and neglected instructing and training his people. He built the Monument of Gusu which was not completed even in seven years. By this time (the people of Wu) felt tired and disheartened. Seeing the friction between the superior and the subordinates in Wu, Goujian of Yue gathered his multitudes to take revenge. He broke into its kuo on the north, moved away its royal boat, and surrounded its palace. And thus Wu perished. Some time ago Jin had six ministers and Zhibo (about 455 B.C.) was the most powerful. He considered the large area of his land and the great number of his people, and desired to attack the feudal lords in order to have a rapid spread of his courageous name through war and battle. So he ranked his brave warriors and arranged his boat and chariot forces. He attacked (the house of) Zhongxing and seized it. This showed to him that his plans were satisfactory. Then he attacked Fan and totally defeated him. Thus he absorbed three families into one. He did not stop even there. but surrounded Minister Xiang of Zhao at Jinyang. By this time Han and Wei came together and deliberated, saying: ""An ancient proverb says: 'When the lips are removed the teeth will become cold.' The house of Zhao dying in the morning we would be following it in the evening; the house of Zhao dying in the evening we would be following it in the morning. A poet sings: 'If the fish would not act while yet in water, what can it do when it is already placed on land?'"" Thereupon the three ministers worked with united strength and a single mind, opening passes and blazing trails, putting on armour and arousing the warriors. With Han and Wei from without and Zhao from within, they battled Zhibo and totally defeated him. Therefore Mozi said : An ancient proverb says: ""The superior man would not go to water but to man for a mirror."" In water as a mirror one sees only one's face; in man as a mirror one can predict good and bad luck."" Have those who now regard offensive wars as beneficial made use of Zhibo's story? It is plainly discernible to be not auspicious but ominous.1. 其 : Inserted.  孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》"
子墨子言曰：「今天下之所譽善者，其說將何哉1？為其上中天之利，而中中鬼之利，而下中人之利，故譽之與？意亡非為其上中天之利，而中中鬼之利，而下中人之利，故譽之與？雖使下愚之人，必曰：『將為其上中天之利，而中中鬼之利，而下中人之利，故譽之』。今天下之所同義者，聖王之法也。今天下之諸侯將猶多皆免攻伐并兼，則是有譽義之名，而不察其實也。此譬猶盲者之與人，同命白黑之名，而不能分其物也，則豈謂有別哉？是故古之知者之為天下度也，必順慮其義，而後為之行，是以動則不疑，速通成得其所欲，而順天鬼百姓之利，則知者之道也。是故古之仁人有天下者，必反大國之說，一天下之和，總四海之內，焉率天下之百姓，以農臣事上帝山川鬼神。利人多，功故又大，是以天賞之，鬼富之，人譽之，使貴為天子，富有天下，名參乎天地，至今不廢。此則知者之道也，先王之所以有天下者也。,"Mozi said: What does the world now praise to be good? Is not an act praised because it is useful to Heaven on high, to the spirits in the middle sphere, and to the people below? Certainly no other reason is needed for praise than to be useful to Heaven on high, to the spirits in the middle, and to the people below. Even the stupid would say it is praiseworthy when it is helpful to Heaven on high, to the spirits in the middle, and to the people below. And what the world agrees on is just the way of the sage-kings. Now the feudal lords in the empire still attack and assault each other. This is to praise the principle without understanding its real meaning. They resemble the blind man who uses with others the names of black and white but cannot discriminate between such objects. Can this be said to be real discrimination? Therefore, deliberating for the empire, the ancient wise men always considered the real (meaning of the) principles, and acted accordingly. Hence thev were no more uncertain in their actions. All desires, far or near, were satisfied, and Heaven, the spirits, and the people were all blessed. Such was the way of the wise men. Governing the empire, the ancient magnanimous men always worked for mutual satisfaction with the large states, brought the empire into harmony, and centralized all that was within the four seas. Then they led the people in the empire diligently to do service to God, hills and rivers, and the spirits and ghosts. Many were the benefits to the people and great was their success. Thereupon Heaven rewarded them, the spirits enriched them, and the people praised them. The high honour of Son of Heaven was conferred upon them and the great wealth of the whole world was given to them. Their names partake of (the permanence and greatness of) Heaven and Earth and are not forgotten even to this day. Such is the way of the wise and such is the way by which the ancient kings came to possess the world.1. 哉 : Inserted.  孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》"
今王公大人天下之諸侯則不然，將必皆差論其爪牙之士，皆列其舟車之卒伍，於此為堅甲利兵，以往攻伐無罪之國。入其國家邊境，芟刈其禾稼，斬其樹木，墮其城郭，以湮其溝池，攘殺其牲牷，燔潰其祖廟，勁殺其萬民，覆其老弱，遷其重器，卒進而柱乎鬥，曰『死命為上，多殺次之，身傷者為下，又況失列北橈乎哉，罪死無赦』，以譂其眾。夫無兼國覆軍，賊虐萬民，以亂聖人之緒。意將以為利天乎？夫取天之人，以攻天之邑，此刺殺天民，剝振神之位，傾覆社稷，攘殺其犧牲，則此上不中天之利矣。意將以為利鬼乎？夫殺之人，滅鬼神之主，廢滅先王，賊虐萬民，百姓離散，則此中不中鬼之利矣。意將以為利人乎？夫殺之人，為利人也博矣。又計其費此，為周生之本，竭天下百姓之財用，不可勝數也，則此下不中人之利矣。,"The rulers and lords of to-day are quite different. They all rank their warriors and arrange their boat and chariot forces; they make their armour strong and weapons sharp in order to attack some innocent state. Entering the state they cut down the grain fields and fell the trees and woods; they tear down the inner and outer walls of the city and fill up the ditches and ponds; they seize and kill the sacrificial animals and burn down the ancestral temple; they kill and murder the people and exterminate the aged and weak; they move away the treasures and valuables. The soldiers are encouraged to advance by being told: ""To suffer death is the highest (service you can render), to kill many is the next, to be wounded is the lowest. But if you should drop out from your rank and attempt to sneak away, the penalty will be death without moderation."" Thus the soldiers are put to fear. Now to capture a state and to destroy an army, to disturb and torture the people, and to set at naught the aspirations of the sages by confusion - is this intended to bless Heaven? But the people of Heaven are gathered together to besiege the towns belonging to Heaven. This is to murder men of Heaven and dispossess the spirits of their altars and to ruin the state and to kill the sacrificial animals. It is then not a blessing to Heaven on high. Is it intended to bless the spirits? But men of Heaven are murdered, spirits are deprived of their sacrifices, the earlier kings are neglected, the multitude are tortured and the people are scattered; it is then not a blessing to the spirits in the middle. Is it intended to bless the people? But the blessing of the people by killing them off must be very meagre. And when we calculate the expense, which is the root of the calamities to living, we find the property of innumerable people is exhausted. It is, then, not a blessing to the people below either."
今夫師者之相為不利者也，曰：將不勇，士不分，兵不利，教不習，師不眾，率不利和，威不圉，害之不久，爭之不疾，孫之不強。植心不堅，與國諸侯疑，與國諸侯疑，則敵生慮，而意羸矣。偏具此物，而致從事焉，則是國家失卒，而百姓易務也。今不嘗觀其說好攻伐之國？若使中興師，君子庶人也，必且數千，徒倍十萬，然後足以師而動矣。久者數歲，速者數月，是上不暇聽治，士不暇治其官府，農夫不暇稼穡，婦人不暇紡績織紝，則是國家失卒，而百姓易務也，然而又與其車馬之罷弊也，幔幕帷蓋，三軍之用，甲兵之備，五分而得其一，則猶為序疏矣。然而又與其散亡道路，道路遼遠，糧食下繼傺，食飲之時，廁役以此飢寒凍餒疾病，而轉死溝壑中者，不可勝計也。此其為不利於人也，天下之害厚矣。而王公大人，樂而行之。則此樂賊滅天下之萬民也，豈不悖哉！今天下好戰之國，齊、晉、楚、越，若使此四國者得意於天下，此皆十倍其國之眾，而未能食其地也。是人不足而地有餘也。今又以爭地之故，而反相賊也，然則是虧不足，而重有餘也」。,"Now that the armies are intended for mutual destruction, it is evident: If the general be not courageous, if soldiers be not brave, if weapons be not sharp, if drills be not frequent, if the force be not large, if generals be not harmonious, if power be not august, if a siege be not enduring, if an assault be not speedy, if people be not strongly bound together, if determination be not firm - if this be so, the (other) feudal lords will suspect. When feudal lords entertain suspicion, enemies will be stirred up and cause anxiety, and the morale will be weakened. On the other hand, if every preparation is in good shape and the state goes out to engage in war, then the state will lose its men and the people will neglect their vocations. Have we not heard it said that, when a warring state goes on an expedition, of the officers there must be several hundred, of the common people there must be several thousand, and of the soldiers and prisoners there must be ten thousand, before the army can set out? It may last for several years, or, at the shortest, several months. So, the superior will have no time to attend to government, the officials will have no time to attend to their offices, the farmers will have no time to sow or reap, the women will have no time to weave or spin: that is, the state will lose its men and the people will neglect their vocations. Besides, the chariots will break and horses will be exhausted. As to tents, army supplies, and soldiers' equipment - if one-fifth of these can remain (after the war) it would already be beyond expectation. Moreover, innumerable men will be missing and lost on the way, and will become sick from the long distances, meagre rations, hunger and cold, and die in the ditches. Now the calamity to the people and the world is tremendous. Yet the rulers enjoy doing it. This means they enjoy injuring and exterminating the people; is this not perversity? The most warring states in the empire to-day are Qi, Jin, Chu, and Yue. These four states are all successful in the world. Even if their people be increased tenfold, still they could not consume all that their land could produce. That is, they are in need of men while they have a surplus of land. Still they strove against each other to possess more land. This is to neglect what is needed and to value what is already in plenty."
今遝夫好攻伐之君，又飾其說以非子墨子曰：「以攻伐之為不義，非利物與？昔者禹征有苗，湯伐桀，武王伐紂，此皆立為聖王，是何故也？」子墨子曰：「子未察吾言之類，未明其故者也。彼非所謂攻，謂誅也。昔者三苗大亂，天命殛之，日妖宵出，雨血三朝，龍生於廟，犬哭乎巿，夏冰，地坼及泉，五穀變化，民乃大振。高陽乃命玄宮，禹親把天之瑞令以征有苗，四電誘袛，有神人面鳥身，若瑾以侍，搤矢有苗之祥，苗師大亂，後乃遂幾。禹既已克有三苗，焉磨為山川，別物上下，卿制大極，而神民不違，天下乃靜。則此禹之所以征有苗也。遝至乎夏王桀，天有酷命，日月不時，寒暑雜至，五穀焦死，鬼呼國，鶴鳴十夕餘。天1乃命湯於鑣宮，用受夏之大命，夏德大亂，予既卒其命於天矣，往而誅之，必使汝堪之。湯焉敢奉率其眾，是以鄉有夏之境，帝乃使陰暴毀有夏之城。少少有神來告曰：『夏德大亂，往攻之，予必使汝大堪之。予既受命於天，天命融隆火，于夏之城閒西北之隅。湯奉桀眾以克有，屬諸侯於薄，薦章天命，通于四方，而天下諸侯莫敢不賓服。則此湯之所以誅桀也。遝至乎商王紂天不序其德，祀用失時。兼夜中，十日雨土于薄，九鼎遷止，婦妖宵出，有鬼宵吟，有女為男，天雨肉，棘生乎國道，王兄自縱也。赤鳥銜珪，降周之岐社，曰：『天命周文王伐殷有國。』泰顛來賓，河出綠圖，地出乘黃。武王踐功，夢見三神曰2：予既沈漬殷紂于酒德矣，往攻之，予必使汝大堪之』。武王乃攻狂夫，反商之周，天賜武王黃鳥之旗。王既已克殷，成帝之來，分主諸神，祀紂先王，通維四夷，而天下莫不賓，焉襲湯之緒，此即武王之所以誅紂也。若以此三聖王者觀之，則非所謂攻也，所謂誅也」。,"The warring lords would gloss over (their conduct) with arguments to confute Mozi, saying: ""Do you condemn attack and assault as unrighteous and not beneficial? But, anciently, Yu made war on the Prince of Miao, Tang on Jie, and King Wu on Zhou. Yet these are regarded as sages. What is your explanation for this?"" Mozi said: You have not examined the terminology of my teaching and you do not understand its motive. What they did is not to be called ""attack"" but ""punishment."" Anciently, the three Miao tribes were in great confusion. Heaven ordered their destruction. The sun rose at night. It rained blood for three days. Dragons emerged in the temple and dogs cried in the market place. Ice came in summer and earth cracked until water gushed forth. The five grains appeared in mutation. At these, the people were greatly shocked. Gao Yang then gave command (to Yu) in the Yuan Palace. Yu held the imperial jade order in hand and set forth to conquer Miao. Amidst thunder and lightning, a god with the face of a man and the body of a bird was revealed to be waiting upon (Yu) with the gui in hand. The general of Miao was brought down by an arrow and the Miao army was set in great confusion. And the Miao tribes became less and less significant ever after. Having conquered Miao, Yu set apart the hills and rivers (by names), and ordered things into high and low. With sacrifices he set up the four bordering countries, and neither spirits nor men revolted (any more). So there was peace in the world. This was the reason why Yu made war on the Miao. When it came to King Jie of Xia, Heaven gave severe order. Sun and moon did not appear on time. Winter and summer came irregularly. The five grains were dried up to death. Ghosts called in the country, and cranes shrieked for more than ten nights. Heaven then commissioned Tang in the Biao Palace, to receive the great trust that had been given to Xia, as the conduct of Xia fell into great perversity. Only then dared Tang to lead his multitude and enter the borders of Xia. And he let the deserters of the enemy destroy the cities of Xia. Soon after, a god came and told him: ""The conduct of Xia is in great confusion. Go and punish him. I will surely let you destroy him, as I have my orders from Heaven."" Heaven ordered Zhuyong to send down fire on the northwestern corner of the city of Xia. Thus Tang led the men of Jie and conquered Xia. He then gave audience to the feudal lords at Bo. He revealed and made known the will of Heaven and spread it in the four directions, and none of the feudal lords in the empire dared to show disrespect. This was the reason why Tang punished Jie. When it came to the regime of King Zhou of Shang, his conduct was not acceptable to Heaven. Sacrifices were not according to seasons. Even in the night... It rained sand for ten days at Bo. The nine caldrons moved from their place. Witches appeared in the dark and ghosts sighed at night. Some women turned into men. Flesh came down from Heaven like rain. Thorny brambles covered up the national highways. Yet the king became even more dissolute. A red bird holding a gui by its beak alighted on Mt. Qi, proclaiming: ""Heaven decrees King Wen of Zhou to punish Yin and possess its empire."" Tai Dian then came to be minister to (King Wen). The charts emerged out of the River and chenghuang appeared on land. Thereupon King Wu ascended the throne. Three gods spoke to him in a dream, saying: ""Now that we have submerged Zhou of Yin in wine, you go and attack him. We will surely let you destroy him."" So, King Wu set out and attacked Zhou, and replaced Shang with Zhou. Heaven gave King Wu the Yellow Bird Pennant. Having conquered Yin he continued the order of Tang and assigned the worship of the ancestors of Zhou to the feudal lords. Connexions with the barbarians of the four borders were established, and none in the world dared to show disrespect. This was the reason why King Wu punished Zhou. Speaking about the work of these three sages, it is not to be called attack but punishment.1. 天 : Inserted.  孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》2. 曰 : Inserted.  孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》"
則夫好攻伐之君，又飾其說以非子墨子曰：「子以攻伐為不義，非利物與？昔者楚熊麗始討此睢山之閒，越王繄虧」，出自有遽，始邦於越，唐叔與呂尚邦齊晉。此皆地方數百里，今以并國之故，四分天下而有之。是故何也？」子墨子曰：「子未察吾言之類，未明其故者也。古者天子之始封諸侯也，萬有餘，今以并國之故，萬國有餘皆滅，而四國獨立。此譬猶醫之藥萬有餘人，而四人愈也，則不可謂良醫矣。」,"The warring lords would again gloss over (their conduct) with arguments for offensive war against Mozi, saying: Do you condemn attack and assault as unrighteous and not beneficial? But, in ancient times, Xiong Li was assigned to the state of Chu (about 1100 B.C.) in the Mt. of Sui. Yi Kui started at Youju, and became lord of Yue. Uncle Tang and Lu Shang were first appointed to rule over the states of Jin (1107 B.C.) and of Qi (about 1120 B.C.) respectively. All these started with a few hundred li square of land. On account of their capture of other states, now each of them has a quarter of the empire. What is your explanation for this?"" Mozi said: You have not examined the terminology of my teachings and you do not understand the underlying principle. In ancient times the emperor commissioned feudal lords numbering more than ten thousand. On account of absorption of one state by another, all of the more than ten thousand states have disappeared with only the four remaining. This is like the physician who attends more than ten thousand patients but cures only four. Such an one is not to be said to be a good physician."
則夫好攻伐之君又飾其說曰：「我非以金玉、子女、壤地為不足也，我欲以義名立於天下，以德求諸侯也。」子墨子曰：「今若有能以義名立於天下，以德求諸侯者，天下之服可立而待也。夫天下處攻伐久矣，譬若傅子之為馬然。今若有能信效先利天下諸侯者，大國之不義也，則同憂之；大國之攻小國也，則同救之；小國城郭之不全也，必使修之；布粟之絕，則委之；幣帛不足，則共之。以此效大國，則小國之君說，人勞我逸，則我甲兵強。寬以惠，緩易急，民必移。易攻伐以治我國，攻必倍。量我師舉之費，以爭諸侯之斃，則必可得而序利焉。督以正，義其名，必務寬吾眾，信吾師，以此授諸侯之師，則天下無敵矣。其為下不可勝數也。此天下之利，而王公大人不知而用，則此可謂不知利天下之巨務矣。」是故子墨子曰：「今且天下之王公大人士居子，中情將欲求興天下之利，除天下之害，當若繁為攻伐，此實天下之巨害也。今欲為仁義，求為上士，尚欲中聖王之道，下欲中國家百姓之利，故當若非攻之為說，而將不可不察者此也。」,"The warring lords would again gloss over (their conduct) with arguments, saying: ""(I wage war) not because I am still discontented with my gold and jade, my children and my land. I want to have my name as a righteous ruler established in the world and draw the other feudal lords to me with my virtue."" Mozi said: If there were some one who would establish his righteous name for justice in the world and draw the feudal lords to him with his virtue, the submission of the whole world to him could be awaited while standing. For the world has long been in turmoil and war, and it is weary like the boy at playing horse. If only there were some one who would first benefit the other feudal lords in mutual good faith! When some large state acts unrighteously, he would join in the sorrow; when some large state attacks some smaller one he would join in the rescue; when the outer and the inner walls of the city of the small state are in ruin he would demand their repair; when cloth and grains are exhausted he would supply them; when money and silk are insufficient he would share his own - to befriend the large state in this way, the large state will be pleased, to befriend the small state in this way, the small state will be pleased. With the others tired out and one's self at ease, one's armour and weapon would be stronger. When with kindness and mercy we help the people in their need, the people will be drawn over. When good government is substituted for aggressive war, the country will be benefited many fold. When the expense of the army is limited and the evils of the feudal lords removed, then we shall enjoy prosperity. Let the control (of the army) be judicious and the cause be righteous. Be lenient to the people and place confidence in the army - with this to meet the forces of the feudal lords, there can be no equal in the world. And the benefits to the world will be innumerable. This is what wiII benefit the world, yet the rulers do not understand making use of it: such may be said to be ignorance of the great thing in the world. Therefore Mozi said: Now if the rulers and the gentlemen of the world sincerely desire to procure benefits and avert calamities for the world - if they desire to do righteousness and be superior men, if they desire to strike the way of the sage-kings on the one hand and bless the people on the other - if so, the doctrine of Condemnation of Offensive War should not be left unheeded."
