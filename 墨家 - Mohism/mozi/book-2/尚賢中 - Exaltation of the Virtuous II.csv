子墨子言曰：「今王公大人之君人民，主社稷，治國家，欲脩保而勿失，故不察尚賢為政之本也。何以知尚賢之為政本也？曰自貴且智者，為政乎愚且賤者，則治；自愚且賤者，為政乎貴且智者，則亂。是以知尚賢之為政本也。故古者聖王甚尊尚賢而任使能，不黨父兄，不偏貴富，不嬖顏色，賢者舉而上之，富而貴之，以為官長；不肖者抑而廢之，貧而賤之以為徒役，是以民皆勸其賞，畏其罰，相率而為賢。者以賢者眾，而不肖者寡，此謂進賢。然後聖人聽其言，跡其行，察其所能，而慎予官，此謂事能。故可使治國者，使治國，可使長官者，使長官，可使治邑者，使治邑。凡所使治國家，官府，邑里，此皆國之賢者也。,"Mozi said: Now, in caring for the people, ruling the state, and governing the country, the rulers desire permanency and stability. But why do they not learn that exaltation of the virtuous is the foundation of government? How do we know exaltation of the virtuous is the foundation of government? When the honourable and wise run the government, the ignorant and humble remain orderly; but when the ignorant and humble run the government, the honourable and wise become rebellious. Therefore we know exaltation of the virtuous is the foundation of government. The ancient sage-kings greatly emphasized the exaltation of the virtuous and the employment of the capable. Without special consideration for relatives, for the rich and honoured, or for the good-looking, they exalted and promoted the virtuous, enriched and honoured them, and made them governors and leaders. The vicious they kept back and banished, depossessed and degraded, and made labourers and servants. Thereupon people were all encouraged by rewards and threatened by punishments and strove with each other after virtue. Thus the virtuous multiplied and the vicious diminished in number. Such is exaltation of the virtuous. Then the sage-kings watched their words and observed their conduct, found out their capabilities and carefully assigned them their offices. Such is employment of the capable. Accordingly those who were capable to govern the country were made to govern the country, those who were capable to administer the court were made to administer the court, and those who were capable in managing the districts were made to manage the districts. All those who had charge of the country, the court, and the districts were then the virtuous of the land."
賢者之治國者也，蚤朝晏退，聽獄治政，是以國家治而刑法正。賢者之長官也，夜寢夙興，收斂關市、山林、澤梁之利，以實官府，是以官府實而財不散。賢者之治邑也，蚤出莫入，耕稼、樹藝、聚菽粟，是以菽粟多而民足乎食。故國家治則刑法正，官府實則萬民富。上有以絜為酒醴栥盛，以祭祀天鬼；外有以為皮幣，與四鄰諸侯交接，內有以食飢息勞，將養其萬民。外有以懷天下之賢人。是故上者天鬼富之，外者諸侯與之，內者萬民親之，賢人歸之，以此謀事則得，舉事則成，入守則固，出誅則彊。故唯昔三代聖王堯、舜、禹、湯、文、武，之所以王天下正諸侯者，此亦其法已。,"When the virtuous rules the country, he starts the day early and retires late, hearing lawsuits and attending to the government. As a result, the country is well governed and laws are justly administered. When the virtuous administers the court he retires late and wakes up early, collecting taxes from passes, markets, and on products from mountains, woods, waters, and land to fill the court. As a result, the court is filled and wealth is not wasted. When the virtuous manages the districts, he goes out before sunrise and comes back after sunset, plowing and sowing, planting and cultivating, and gathering harvests of grains. As a result, grains are in plenty and people are sufficiently supplied with food. Therefore when the country is well governed the laws are well administered, and when the court is filled the people are wealthy. For the higher sphere, the rulers had wherewith to make wine and cakes to do sacrifice and libation to Heaven and the spirits. For the countries outside, they had wherewith to provide the furs and money to befriend neighbouring feudal lords. For the people within, they had wherewith to feed the hungry and give rest to the tired. Above all these, they had means to cherish the virtuous. Therefore from above, Heaven and the spirits enrich them from without, the feudal lords submit themselves to them from within, the people show them affection, and the virtuous become loyal to them. Hence they could have satisfaction in planning and success in execution. In defence they are strong and in attack victorious. Now the way that enabled the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties, namely Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen and Wu, to rule the empire and head the feudal lords was no other than this (principle of exaltation of the virtuous)."
既曰若法，未知所以行之術，則事猶若未成，是以必為置三本。何謂三本？曰爵位不高則民不敬也，蓄祿不厚則民不信也，政令不斷則民不畏也。故古聖王高予之爵，重予之祿，任之以事，斷予之令，夫豈為其臣賜哉，欲其事之成也。《詩》曰：『告女憂卹，誨女予爵，孰能執熱，鮮不用濯。』則此語古者國君諸侯之不可以不執善，承嗣輔佐也。譬之猶執熱之有濯也。將休其手焉。古者聖王唯毋得賢人而使之，般爵以貴之，裂地以封之，終身不厭。賢人唯毋得明君而事之，竭四肢之力以任君之事，終身不倦。若有美善則歸之上，是以美善在上，而所怨謗在下，寧樂在君，憂慼在臣，故古者聖王之為政若此。,"However, if there is only the principle while the technique of its application is not known, then it would seem to be still incomplete. Therefore there should be laid down three rules. What are the three rules? They are: (1) when their rank (that of the virtuous) is not high, people would not show them respect; (2) when their emoluments are not liberal, people would not place confidence in them; (3) when their orders are not final, people would not stand in awe before them. So the ancient sage-kings placed them high in rank, gave them liberal emoluments, trusted them with important charges, and decreed their orders to be final. And all this was done not merely to reward their subordinates; it was to fulfil their trust. Thus runs an Ode: ""I am instructing you to take worries and cares of the world as your own; I am teaching the order of ranks for the virtuous and talented. Who can handle heat without rinsing his hands (in cold water)?"" This is to show how in the past the rulers could not do without befriending subordinates and helpers. It was like the necessity of rinsing in handling hot objects to relieve the hands. The ancient sage-kings concentrated on acquiring, and employing the virtuous - honouring them with high ranks, and assigning land to them--unwearied to the end of their lives. The virtuous men on the other hand only hoped to find an enlightened ruler to serve - exhausting all the powers of the four limbs to attend to the king's business - untired to the end of their lives. When there were any excellences and virtues they were attributed to the emperor. Thus excellences and virtues belonged to the emperor while complaints and slanders were directed against the subordinates. Peace and joy abode with the king while worries and sorrows were lodged with the officials. This was how the ancient sage-kings administered the government."
今王公大人亦欲效人以尚賢使能為政，高予之爵，而祿不從也。夫高爵而無祿，民不信也。曰：『此非中實愛我也，假藉而用我也。』夫假藉之民，將豈能親其上哉！故先王言曰：『貪於政者「不能分人以事，厚於貨者不能分人以祿。」事則不與，祲則不分，請問天下之賢人將何自至乎王公大人之側哉？若苟賢者不至乎王公大人之側，則此不肖者在左右也。不肖者在左右，則其所譽不當賢，而所罰不當暴，王公大人尊此以為政乎國家，則賞亦必不當賢，而罰亦必不當暴。若苟賞不當賢而罰不當暴，則是為賢者不勸而為暴者不沮矣。是以入則不慈孝父母，出則不長弟鄉里，居處無節，出入無度，男女無別。使治官府則盜竊，守城則倍畔，君有難則不死，出亡則不從，使斷獄則不中，分財則不均，與謀事不得，舉事不成，入守不固，出誅不彊。故雖昔者三代暴王桀紂幽厲之所以失措其國家，傾覆其社稷者，已此故也。何則？皆以明小物而不明大物也。,"The present ruler, imitating the ancients, also want to employ the virtuous in government by exalting them. Ranks given them are very high, but the emoluments do not follow proportionally. Now, to be high in rank but receive small emoluments will not inspire people's confidence. The virtuous would say to themselves: ""This is not real love for me, but only to make use of me as a means."" Now, how can people be affectionate to their superiors' when they are only (treated as) means? Therefore an ancient king said: ""He who is too ambitious in government will not share his tasks with others. He who over-treasures wealth will not offer big emoluments to others."" When tasks are not assigned and emoluments are not given, it may be asked wherefrom would the virtuous come to the side of the rulers? And when the virtuous are not at the side of the rulers, the vicious will be on their right and left. When the vicious are on the right and left, then commendations will not fall on the virtuous and punishments will not be upon the wicked. If the rulers follow these in governing the states, in the same way rewards will not go to the virtuous and punishment not to the wicked. When rewards really do not go to the virtuous and punishment not to the wicked, then the virtuous will find no encouragement, neither the wicked any obstruction. At home the vicious are not filial to their parents, and, having left their home town, they would not recognize their elders. They move about without restraint and disregard the rules of propriety about sexes. When trusted with the administration of the court, they would steal; when trusted to defend a city, they would raise an insurrection. When the lord meets with death, they would not follow him and commit suicide; when the lord has to flee the country, they would not accompany him in banishment. In judging lawsuits they are not just, and in dividing property they are partial. In planning they are not helpful, in execution they are inefficient. Neither in defence are they strong, nor in attack are they victorious. Now, the reason that the wicked kings of the Three Dynasties, namely, Jie, Zhou, You, and Li, misruled the country and upset their states was no other than this (employment of the vicious). Why is this so? Because they understood petty affairs but were ignorant about things of importance."
今王公大人，有一衣裳不能制也，必藉良工；有一牛羊不能殺也，必藉良宰。故當若之二物者，王公大人未知以尚賢使能為政也。逮至其國家之亂，社稷之危，則不知使能以治之，親戚則使之，無故富貴、面目佼好則使之。夫無故富貴、面目佼好則使之，豈必智且有慧哉！若使之治國家，則此使不智慧者治國家也，國家之亂既可得而知已。且夫王公大人有所愛其色而使，其心不察其知而與其愛。是故不能治百人者，使處乎千人之官，不能治千人者，使處乎萬人之官。此其故何也？曰處若官者爵高而祿厚，故愛其色而使之焉。夫不能治千人者，使處乎萬人之官，則此官什倍也。夫治之法將日至者也，日以治之，日不什脩，知以治之，知不什益，而予官什倍，則此治一而棄其九矣。雖日夜相接以治若官，官猶若不治，此其故何也？則王公大人不明乎以尚賢使能為政也。故以尚賢使能為政而治者，夫若言之謂也，以下賢為政而亂者，若吾言之謂也。,"When the rulers cannot get a coat made they will employ able tailors. When they cannot have an ox or a sheep killed they will employ able butchers. In these two instances they do know they should exalt the virtuous and employ the capable for business. But when it comes to the disorder of the country and danger of the state, they do not know they should exalt the virtuous and employ the capable for government. Rather, they would employ their relatives, they would employ the rich without merit, and the good-looking. But as to the employment of the rich without merit and the good-looking -- will these necessarily prove themselves wise and intelligent? To let these rule the country is to let the unwise and unintelligent rule the country. And disorder can then be predicted. Moreover, the rulers employ their minds by the attractiveness of their appearance, and show them favour without finding out their knowledge. As a result, those who are not capable to rule a hundred men are assigned to posts over a thousand, and those who are not capable to rule a thousand are assigned to posts over ten thousand. What is the reason for this? Why, such positions are high in rank and rich in emoluments. Therefore the specially favoured are picked for them. But to make those incapable of ruling a thousand men rule ten thousand is to increase their duty tenfold. The business of the government comes daily. It is to be attended to every day, yet the day cannot be lengthened by tenfold. To govern, again, requires knowledge. When knowledge is not increased by ten times, while a tenfold task is assigned, it will evidently result in attending to one and neglecting nine. Though the task be attended to day and night, still it cannot be well executed. And the reason for this is because the rulers do not understand that they should exalt the virtuous and employ the capable in government. Thus exaltation of the virtuous and employment of the capable with the consequent success in government is presented above in the earlier paragraphs. And the depreciation of the virtuous with the resulting confusion in government is presented here in these paragraphs."
今王公大人中實將欲治其國家，欲脩保而勿失，胡不察尚賢為政之本也？且以尚賢為政之本者，亦豈獨子墨子之言哉！此聖王之道，先王之書距年之言也。傳曰：『求聖君哲人，以裨輔而身』，《湯誓》云：『聿求元聖，與之戮力同心，以治天下。』則此言聖之不失以尚賢使能為政也。故古者聖王唯能審以尚賢使能為政，無異物雜焉，天下皆得其利。古者舜耕歷山，陶河瀕，漁雷澤，堯得之服澤之陽，舉以為天子，與接天下之政，治天下之民。伊摯，有莘氏女之私臣，親為庖人，湯得之，舉以為己相，與接天下之政，治天下之民。傅說被褐帶索。庸築乎傅巖，武丁得之，舉以為三公，與接天下之政，治天下之民。此何故始賤卒而貴，始貧卒而富？則王公大人明乎以尚賢使能為政。是以民無飢而不得食，寒而不得衣，勞而不得息，亂而不得治者。,"If the rulers now want to govern their states so that they will be permanent and unshakeable, why do they not learn that exaltation of the virtuous is the foundation of government? Besides, is this principle merely a conception of Mozi? It is the way of the sage-kings and the tenet of ""Ju Nian,"" a book of an ancient king. And, thus it is recorded: ""(He) sought out the wise men to protect and aid you."" And thus states the ""Oath of Tang"": ""I then sought for the Great Sage, with whom I might unite my strength and mind to govern the empire."" All these show how the sage-kings never failed to exalt the virtuous and employ the capable in government. The sage-kings of old comprehended onlv this -- to exalt the virtuous and employ the capable in government and nobody else; so the whole world was benefited. In times of old, Shun cultivated land at Mt. Li made pottery by the River, and was engaged in fishing in Lake Lei. Yao discovered him at Fuze. Exalting him, Yao made him Emperor and handed to him the government of the empire and the rule over the people. Yi Zhi once served in the bridal party of the daughter of the Prince of Xin, and later voluntarily served Tang as his cook. Tang discovered him. Exalting him, Tang made him his Prime Minister and handed to him the government of the empire and the rule over the people. Fu Yue once wore garments of coarse cloth tied with ropes, working as an artisan at Fu Yan. Wu Ding discovered him. Exalting him, Wu Ding made him High Duke and handed to him the government of the empire and the rule over the people. Why is it that these people starting in humility arrived at honour, starting in poverty arrived at wealth? It is because these rulers understood the importance of exalting the virtuous and employing the capable in government. Therefore, none of the people were hungry yet without food, cold yet without clothing, tired yet without rest, disturbed yet without peace."
故古聖王以審以尚賢使能為政，而取法於天。雖天亦不辯貧富、貴賤、遠邇、親疏、賢者舉而尚之，不肖者抑而廢之。然則富貴為賢，以得其賞者誰也？曰若昔者三代聖王堯、舜、禹、湯、文、武者是也。所以得其賞何也？曰其為政乎天下也，兼而愛之，從而利之，又率天下之萬民以尚尊天、事鬼、愛利萬民，是故天鬼賞之，立為天子，以為民父母，萬民從而譽之曰『聖王』，至今不已。則此富貴為賢，以得其賞者也。然則富貴為暴，以得其罰者誰也？曰若昔者三代暴王桀、紂、幽、厲者是也。何以知其然也？曰其為政乎天下也，兼而憎之，從而賊之，又率天下之民以詬天侮鬼，賊傲萬民，是故天鬼罰之，使身死而為刑戮，子孫離散，室家喪滅，絕無後嗣，萬民從而非之曰「暴王」，至今不已。則此富貴為暴，而以得其罰者也。然則親而不善，以得其罰者誰也？曰若昔者伯鯀，帝之元子，廢帝之德庸，既乃刑之于羽之郊，乃熱照無有及也，帝亦不愛。則此親而不善以得其罰者也。然則天之所使能者誰也？曰若昔者禹、稷、皋陶是也。何以知其然也？先王之書呂刑道之曰：『皇帝清問下民，有辭有苗。曰群后之肆在下，明明不常，鰥寡不蓋，德威維威，德明維明。乃名三后，恤功於民，伯夷降典，哲民維刑。禹平水土，主名山川。稷隆播種，農殖嘉穀。三后成功，維假於民。』則此言三聖人者，謹其言，慎其行，精其思慮，索天下之隱事遺利，以上事天，則天鄉其德，下施之萬民，萬民被其利，終身無已。故先王之言曰：『此道也，大用之天下則不窕，小用之則不困，脩用之則萬民被其利，終身無已。』周頌道之曰：『聖人之德，若天之高，若地之普，其有昭於天下也。若地之固，若山之承，不坼不崩。若日之光，若月之明，與天地同常。』則此言聖人之德，章明博大，埴固，以脩久也。故聖人之德蓋總乎天地者也。,"And, the ancient sage-kings in exalting the virtuous and employing the capable in government were following the ways of Heaven. Even Heaven does not discriminate among the poor and the rich, the honourable and the humble, the distant and the near, and the related and the unrelated (to those in power). The virtuous were promoted and exalted; the vicious were kept back and banished. Now, who were those that, possessing wealth and position, still strove after virtues and were rewarded ? They were the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties, namely, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen and Wu (12). How were they rewarded? When they governed the empire, they loved all the people universally and benefited them, and led them in doing honour to Heaven and service to the spirits. As they loved and benefited the people, Heaven and the spirits rewarded them, appointing them to be Sons of Heaven, and parents of the people. And, thereupon people praised them, calling them sage-kings even unto this day. These then were those that, possessing wealth and position, still strove after virtues and were rewarded. Now, who were those that, possessing wealth and position, yet practiced evil and were punished? They were the wicked kings of the Three Dynasties, namely, Jie, Zhou, You, and Li. How do we know they were those ? When they governed the empire they disliked all the people inclusively and oppressed them and led them to curse Heaven and the spirits. Oppressing and destroying the people, they were punished by Heaven and the spirits; their corpses were mangled and lacerated, their children and grandchildren were scattered and dispersed, their family hearths were extinguished and descendants exterminated. And, thereupon the people railed at them, calling them wicked kings even unto this day. These, then, are those that, possessing wealth and position, yet practised evil and were punished. Now, who were those that were related (to the ruler) but not virtuous and were visited by punishment? Count Gun was of direct royal descent but had degenerated in the royal virtues. So he was banished to the wilderness of Yu Yu where (in the prison) light could not reach him, neither did the emperor show any favour. Such was he who was related but not virtuous and was visited by punishment. Now, who were those that were employed by Heaven because of their capability? Yu, Ji, and Gao Tao were they. How do we know that? It is found in the "" Penal Code of Lu,"" a book of an early king, thus: ""The Emperor (Yao) inquired among his subjects, and complaints were made against the Miaos (barbarians)."" Again, ""As the feudal lords have been appointed without insight, even the widows and the widowers are not protected. Dignity is revered only when it is accompanied with magnanimity; enlightenment is respected only when it is accompanied with magnanimity. Thereupon three chiefs were commissioned to care for and consolate the people: (1) Bo Yi delivered the laws and statutes and taught therewith the people; (2) Yu reduced the Flood and recovered the land, and gave names to hills and rivers; (3) Ji descended (from his rank) and sowed seeds to encourage good farming. The benefits of the achievements of these three chiefs all fell upon the people."" This is to say that the three sages were careful in speech, vigilant in conduct, penetrating in thought, studying and planning for every detail and benefit of the world--with this to do service to Heaven on high, Heaven will bless their virtue; to bestow it to the people below, the people will be visited by its benefits lasting beyond their lifetime. Thus said the ancient kings: ""Now, this way, when followed broadly to govern the world, will not be found to be too slender; when followed narrowly, will not be too unwieldly; when followed with discretion, will benefit the people beyond their lifetime."" Referring to it, the ""Eulogy of Zhou"" sings: ""The virtue of the sage shining upon the world is lofty as Heaven, wide as earth, high as the mountain, unbreakable and infallible; luminating as the sun, brilliant as the moon, eternal with heaven and earth."" This is to describe how enlightening and all-embracing, deep-rooted and, therefore, permanent is the virtue of the sage. Therefore the virtue of the sage is really inclusive of heaven and earth."
今王公大人欲王天下，正諸侯，夫無德義將何以哉？其說將必挾震威彊。今王公大人將焉取挾震威彊哉？傾者民之死也。民生為甚欲，死為甚憎，所欲不得而所僧屢至，自古及今未嘗能有以此王天下、正諸侯者也。今大人欲王天下，正諸侯，將欲使意得乎天下，名成乎後世，故不察尚賢為1政之本也。此聖人之厚行也。」,"Now, the rulers want to be lord over the empire and be head of the feudal lords. But how can it be done without virtue and righteousness? Their way must be by overpowering and overawing. But what makes them adopt this? It simply pursues the people to death. But life is what the people eagerly desire, and death what they greatly dread. What is desired is not obtained, but what is dreaded befalls them ever so often. From antiquity to the present, none has yet been able to be lord over the empire and head of the feudal lords by this way. Now the rulers desire to be lord of the world and head of the feudal lords and want to have their ideas prevail all over the world, and their names established in posterity. But why do they not learn that exaltation of the virtuous is the foundation of government? This was the actual conduct of the sages.1. 為 : Inserted.  孫詒讓《墨子閒詁》"
