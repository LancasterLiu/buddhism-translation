夫辯者，將以明是非之分，審治亂之紀，明同異之處，察名實之理，處利害，決嫌疑。焉摹略萬物之然，論求群言之比。以名舉實，以辭抒意，以說出故，以類取，以類予。有諸己不非諸人，無諸己不求諸人。,"""Distinguishing"" will be used to make clear the distinction between so and not-so; investigate the rules of order and chaos; make clear the locations of similarity and difference; examine the patterns of name and stuff; locate benefit and harm, and resolve doubts. Only then can one describe in approximation the way the myriad things are, and speak of seeking similarity of sayings. Names are used to raise stuff; phrases are used to express intention; explanations are used to bring out causes. Choose according to kind; offer according to kind. Having it in oneself one do not oppose it in others; lacking it in oneself one do not seek it of others."
或也者，不盡也。假者，今不然也。效者，為之法也，所效者所以為之法也。故中效，則是也；不中效，則非也。此效也。辟也者，舉他1物而以明之也。侔也者，比辭而俱行也。援也者，曰「子然，我奚獨不可以然也？」推也者，以其所不取之同於其所取者，予之也。是猶謂也者，同也。吾豈謂也者，異也。,"""Some"" is not all. ""Suppose"" is not so now. ""Imitation"" is to make a standard: what is imitated is that which is used to make the standard. Thus what matches the imitation is so; what does not match the imitation is not so. This is imitation. ""Analogy"" is raising another thing to make something clear. ""Similarity"" is similar sayings proceeding together. ""Leading"" is saying, ""You take it as so - why can I alone not take it as so?"" ""Extending"" is taking what he has not chosen but is similar to what he has chosen, and presenting it to him. ""It is like this"" is similarity. ""How could I be like this"" is difference.1. 他 : Originally read: ""也""."
夫物有以同而不率遂同。辭之侔也，有所至而正。其然也，有所以然也；其然也1同，其所以然不必同。其取之也，有所2以取之。其取之也同，其所以取之不必同。是故辟、侔、援、推之辭，行而異，轉而危，遠而失，流而離本，則不可不審也，不可常用也。故言多方，殊類，異故，則不可偏觀也。夫物或乃是而然，或是而不然，或一周3而一不周4，或一是而一不是也。不可常用也。故言多方，殊類，異故，則不可偏觀也，5非也。,"Things have that by which they are similar, but this does not make them the similar. Similarity of sentences is correct within a certain range. That it is so, has that by which is so. When things are the same in being so, that by which they are so is not necessarily the same. When something is chosen, there is that by which it is chosen. When what is chosen is the same, that by which it is chosen is not necessarily the same. Thus the sayings of Analogy, Similarity, Leading, and Extending, proceed and become different, turn and become unsafe, go far and become lost, flow and lose their foundation - this must be examined, and they cannot be constantly applied. Thus doctrine should rely upon many methods, various kinds, different causes, and cannot be looked upon from a single perspective. Things are sometimes thus and so; sometimes thus and not so; sometimes one requires all and one not all; sometimes one thus and one not thus.1. 其然也 : Inserted. 2. 所 : Inserted. 3. 周 : Originally read: ""害"". 4. 周 : Originally read: ""害"". 5. 不是也。不可常用也。故言多方，殊類，異故，則不可偏觀也， : Deleted. 衍文。"

If this is so, then though thieves are men, caring for thieves is not caring for men; not caring for thieves is not not-caring for men; killing thieves is not killing men – there is nothing difficult in it! This and those are of the same kind; the world have those and don't oppose themselves, [yet] we Mohists have this and they oppose us.

愛人，待周愛人而後為愛人。不愛人，不待周不愛人；不周愛，因為不愛人矣。乘馬，不待周乘馬然後為乘馬也；有乘於馬，因為乘馬矣。逮至不乘馬，待周不乘馬而後不乘馬而後不乘馬1。此一周而一不周者也。,"Caring for people requires caring for all people to count as caring for people; not caring for people does not require not caring for all people to count as not caring for people. Not caring for all people implies not caring for people.Riding horses does not require riding all horses to count as riding horses;Having ridden upon a horse implies riding horses.By contrast, not riding horses requires not riding all [i.e. any] horses to count as not riding horses.This is ""one requires all and one not all"".1. 而後不乘馬 : Deleted."
