What are these offices today?Yangzi said: The offices of Xi and He are similar.The other said: Which is similar to Zheng and which is similar to Li?Yangzi said: Xi is similar to Zhong and He is similar to Li."
或問「黃帝終始」。曰：「托也。昔者姒氏治水土，而巫步多禹；扁鵲，盧人也，而醫多盧。夫欲讎偽者必假真。禹乎？盧乎？終始乎？」,"Someone asked about the Cycle of the Yellow Emperor. Yangzi said: It falsely borrows his name. In the past, Yu controlled the waters flooding the land, and now shamans dance the many Steps of Yu. Bian Qiao was a man of Lu, and now many healers are called Men of Lu. Those who want to sell what is fake inevitably borrow from the genuine. The Steps of Yu? Men of Lu? The Cycle of Huangdi? Please!"
或問「渾天」。曰：「落下閎營之，鮮於妄人度之，耿中丞象之，幾乎！幾乎！莫之能違也。」,"Someone asked about the huntian theory. Yangzi said: Luoxia Hong devised it, Xianyu Wangren calculated it, and Geng Zhongcheng created the armillary sphere. So subtle, so subtle! No one can contradict it!"
「請問『蓋天』。」曰：「蓋哉！蓋哉！應難未幾也。」,May I ask about gaitian theory?Yangzi said: The gaitian theory! The gaitian theory! For answering difficult questions it is not as subtle.
或問：「趙世多神，何也？」曰：「神怪茫茫，若存若亡，聖人曼雲。」,"Someone asked: Why were the rulers of Qin so preoccupied with spirits?Yangzi said: Spirits are strange and unintelligible, now seeming to be here, now not. The sage does not speak about them."
或問：「子胥、種、蠡孰賢？」曰：「胥也，俾吳作亂，破楚入郢，鞭尸，藉館，皆不由德。謀越諫齊不式，不能去，卒眼之。種、蠡不強諫而山棲，俾其君詘社稷之靈而童僕，又終斃吳，賢皆不足邵也，至蠡策種而遁，肥矣哉！」,"Someone asked: Among Wu Zixu, Wen Zhong and Fan Li, who was worthy?Yangzi said: Zi Xu helped the state of Wu make trouble, destroyed the state of Chu, entered the capital at Ying, whipped the corpse of King Ping and expelled the government officials —none of this was virtuous (de). He plotted against the state of Yue and remonstrated against attacking Qi to no good use. Unable to leave, he finally saw the destruction of Wu with his own eyes. Wen Zhong and Fan Li did not strongly remonstrate against King Gou Jian of Yue's plan to attack the state of Wu, and he was held by King Fuchai of Wu for three years on Mount Kuaiji. They caused their ruler to yield the altars of the spirits of earth and become a servant boy to King Fuchai. In the end, they destroyed Wu, but none of them were good enough to be considered worthy. In the end Fan Li sent Wen Zhong a letter warning him to flee and then escaped to go fatten himself!"
或問「陳勝、吳廣」。曰：「亂。」曰：「不若是則秦不亡。」曰：「亡秦乎？恐秦未亡而先亡矣。」,"Someone asked about Chen Sheng and Wu Guang.Yangzi said: They were rebels.The other said: But if not for them, the Qin would not have been destroyed.Yangzi said: Did they really destroy the Qin? I'm afraid that Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were destroyed before the Qin."
或問：「六國並，其已久矣。一病一瘳，迄始皇三載而咸，時激、地保、人事乎？」曰：「具。」「請問事。」曰：「孝公以下，強兵力農，以蠶食六國，事也。」「保。」曰：「東溝大河，南阻高山，西采雍、梁，北鹵涇垠，便則申，否則蟠，保也。」「激。」曰：「始皇方斧，將相方刀，六國方木，將相方肉，激也。」,"Someone said: The six kingdoms stood together for a long time, one now weak, the other now strong. Qin Shi Huangdi appeared and they were all[unified within three years. Was this because of fortunate timing, the natural defensibility of the land, or man's doing?Yangzi said: All of them.May I ask about man's doing?Yangzi said: From the time of Duke Xiao on down, Qin strengthened its armies and empowered its farmers—they were like silkworms eating away at the six kingdoms. This was man's doing.The other said: May I ask about the natural defensibility of the land?Yangzi said: To the east, the Yellow River served as a moat; to the south, it was obstructed by high mountains; to the west they took Yong and Liang, and to the north, it was bordered by the Jing River. When it was advantageous, Qin expanded its territory. When it was not, it just coiled up. This was the natural defensibility of the land.The other said: How was it due to fortunate timing?Yangzi said: At that time Qin Shi Huangdi was like an axe and his generals were like knives. The six kingdoms were like wood, and their generals were like meat. This was fortunate timing."
或問：「秦伯列為侯衛，卒吞天下，而赧曾無以制乎？」曰：「天子制公侯伯子男也，庸節。節莫差於僣，僣莫重於祭，祭莫重於地，地莫重於天，則襄、文、宣、靈其兆也。昔者，襄公始僣，西畤以祭白帝；文、宣、靈宗，興鄜、密、上、下，用事四帝，而天王不匡，反致文、武胙。是以四疆之內各以其力來侵，攘肌及骨，而赧獨何以制秦乎？」,"The descendants of Bo Yi of the Qin were the protectors of the feudal lords, but suddenly they swallowed up all under Heaven. Why did King Nan of Zhou to restrict their expansion. Yangzi replied: The Son of Heaven restricts dukes, marquis, earls, viscounts and barons using rules of ceremony. In the rules of ceremony there is no fault greater than usurpation. In usurpation, no fault is greater those than in making sacrificial offerings. In making offerings, there is nothing more important than the place of the ceremony, and in the place of the ceremony, nothing is more important than choosing a place to sacrifice to Tian. This being so, Duke Xiang, Duke Wen, Duke Xuan and Duke Ling built their temples. In the past, Duke Xiang usurped the Western Alter and made offerings to the White Emperor. Dukes Wen, Xuan and Ling built temples at Fu, Mi, Shang and Xia to sacrifice to the Four Deities. The Son of Heaven did not rectify this, and to the contrary, wrongly made offerings to King Wen and King Wu. As a result, all within the four boundaries used their power to encroach upon each other, tearing apart flesh and bone. How could King Nan alone control the Qin?"
或問：「贏政二十六載，天下擅秦。秦十五載而楚，楚五載而漢。五十載之際，而天下三擅，天邪？人邪？」曰：「具。周建子弟，列名城，班五爵，流之十二，當時雖欲漢，得乎？六國蚩蚩，為嬴弱姬，卒之屏營。嬴擅其政，故天下擅秦。秦失其猷，罷侯置守，守失其微，天下孤睽。項氏暴強，改宰侯王，故天下擅楚。擅楚之月，有漢創業山南，發跡三秦，迫項山東，故天下擅漢：天也。」「人。」曰：「兼才尚權，右計左數，動謹於時，人也。」天不人不因，人不天不成。,"Someone asked: In twenty-six years of rule, Qin Shi Huang had seized all under Heaven. Fifteen years later Chu seized it, and only five years after that Han controlled it. In a fifty-year period, the empire had changed hands three times. Was this due to Tian or man?Yangzi said: Both. The Zhou installed their sons and brothers, divided up the titles and fiefdoms, ordered the five ranks, and established the twelve kingdoms. Even at that time, there were some like the Han that desired to control the empire, but what could they do about it? Then six kingdoms became foolish and disordered, helping Qin Shi Huang to weaken the Zhou, and finally to brush aside their armies and seize control of their kingdoms. Thus, the empire was seized by the Qin. They ended the Zhou system of feudal appointments and the establishment of prefectures, and the prefects lost their control, leaving the world orphaned and separated. Xiang Yu rebelled and replaced the ministers and princes, and thus empire was taken over by Chu. In the month Chu seized control and divided the empire into eighteen kingdoms, Liu Bang of Han was established in the southern mountains. He set out searching throughout the three kingdoms at the heart of the former Qin, and pursued Xiang Yu to Shandong, and thus the empire was taken by the Han. This was due to Tian.The other said: What about man?Yangzi said: Collecting together men of talent and respecting their knowledge, planning and calculating meticulously, and carefully acting at just the right moment—this is due to man. Without man, Tian has nothing to rely on. Without Tian, man cannot succeed."
或問：「楚敗垓下，方死，曰：『天也。』諒乎？」曰：「漢屈群策，群策屈群力。楚憞群策而自屈其力。屈人者克，自屈者負。天曷故焉。」,"Someone asked: When Xiang Yu was defeated at Gaixia and close to death, he said, ""It is the will of Tian."" Is this so?Yangzi said: Han Gaozu fully used the strategies of others, because the strategies of others fully used their strengths. Xiang Yu resented using the strategies of others, and exhausted only his own strength. Those who make full use of others are victorious, while those who use only their own strengths are defeated. What does Tian have to do with it?"
或問：「秦、楚既為天典命矣，秦縊灞上，楚分江西，興廢何速乎？」曰：「天胙光德而隕明忒。昔在有熊、高陽、高辛、唐、虞、三代，咸有顯懿，故天胙之，為神明主，且著在天庭，是生民之願也，厥饗國久長。若秦、楚強鬩震撲，胎藉三正，播其虐於黎苗，子弟且欲喪之，況於民乎？況於鬼神乎？廢未速也！」,"Someone asked: Qin Shi Huang and Xiang Yu both received Tian's mandate to rule, but Qin Shi Huang was strangled on the Ba River, and Xiangyu was cut into pieces at Hong Xi. Why were they cast aside so quickly?Yangzi said: Tian honors glorious de and overthrows excessive corruption. In the past the Yellow Emperor, Gao Yang, Gao Xin, Tang, Shun and the Three Dynasties all clearly manifested de. Thus Tian honored them, used them to unite Heaven and Earth, and placed them in the Imperial Hall. This is what the people desired, and long did their kingdoms flourish. Xiang Yu and the Qin Shi Huang, on the other hand, ruled by force, feuded quarrelsomely, terrorized, and attacked each other. They coldly rejected the three proper daos of Heaven, Earth and Man and their reputation for cruelty spread among the masses. Even their own children and followers wanted to kill them, how much more so their people? How much more so ghosts and spirits? They could not have been done away with fast enough!"
或問：「仲尼大聖，則天曷不胙？」曰：「無土。」「然則舜、禹有土乎？」曰：「舜以堯作土，禹以舜作土。」,"Someone asked: If Confucius was a great sage, the why did Tian not honor him by making him a ruler.Yangzi said: He had no land.If this is so, then did Shun and Yu have land?Yangzi said: Shun had Yao to honor him with land, Yu had Shun to honor him with land."
或問「聖人表裏」。曰：「威儀文辭，表也；德行忠信，裏也。」,Someone asked about the outer appearance and inner essence of the sage.Yangzi said: Majestic deportment and refined (wen) words—these are the outer appearance. Virtuous (de) action and faithful integrity—this is the inner essence.
或問：「義帝初矯，劉龕南陽，項救河北。二方分崩，一離一合，設秦得人，如何？」曰：「人無為秦也，喪其靈久矣。」,"Someone asked: When Emperor Yi first established his rule, Liu Bang took Nanyang and Xiang Ji rescued Hebei. The two regions were split apart, some leaving, some joining. If the Qin had capable men, why did this happen?Yangzi said: People would not fight for the Qin because they lost their spirit long ago."
韓信、黥布皆劍立，南面稱孤，卒窮時戮，無乃勿乎？或曰：「勿則無名，如何？」曰：「名者，謂令名也。忠不終而躬逆，焉攸令？」,"Yangzi said: Han Xin and Qing Bu both established themselves by the sword and became rulers. But in the end, they ran out of time and were killed. Were they not stupid? Someone said: If they were stupid, then they would not have made names for themselves, would they?Yangzi said: Making a name for oneself means having an honorable reputation. But showing no loyalty and rebelling in the end—that's far from honorable."
或問「淳於越」。曰：「伎曲。」「請問。」曰：「始皇方虎挒而梟磔，噬士猶臘肉也。越與亢眉，終無撓辭，可謂伎矣。仕無妄之國，食無妄之粟，分無妄之橈，自令之間而不違，可謂曲矣。」,"Someone asked about Chunyu Yue.Yangzi said: He stood strong, and yielded. The other said: May I ask about it?Yangzi said: At that time the First Emperor snapped bones like a tiger, tore open flesh like an owl, and he bit into scholars like sacrificial meat. Chunyu Yue courageously raised an eyebrow at him, and in the end never said a flattering word. This can be called standing strong. He served the government without worrying about the kingdom's politics, he supported himself without worrying about salary, and took part without worrying about flattering anyone. He cultivated a good reputation in private without disobeying orders. This can be called yielding."
或問：「茅焦歷井幹之死，使始皇奉虛左之乘。蔡生欲安項咸陽，不能移，又亨之，其者未辯與？」曰：「生舍其木侯而謂人木侯，亨不亦宜乎？焦逆訐而順守之，雖辯，劘虎牙矣！」,"Someone asked: Mao Jiao witnessed dead bodies being piled up like the railings around a well, yet he persuaded Qin Shi Huang to leave empty the space to the left of his chariot. Cai Sheng desired to pacify Xiang Yu at Xianyang, but he was unable to influence him, and was then boiled alive. Wasn't this because Mao was persuasive and Cai not?Yangzi said: Cai Sheng was crazy as a monkey and called Xiang Yu a monkey—isn't it quite appropriate he was boiled alive? Mao Jiao opposed and criticized Qin Shi Huang, and yet got along and protected himself. But even though he was persuasive, was he not brushing the tiger's teeth?"
或問：「甘羅之悟呂不韋，張辟彊之覺平、勃，皆以十二齡，戊、良乎？」曰：「才也戊、良，不必父祖。」,"Someone asked: Gan Luo assisted Lu Buwei, and Zhang Piqiang awakened the minds of Chen Ping and Zhou Bo. Both were only twelve years old! Wasn't this due to the influence of Gan Mou and Zhang Liang?Yangzi said: It was their natural ability, not necessarily because Gan Mou and Zhang Liang were their grandfather and father."
或問：「酈食其說陳留，下敖倉，說齊，罷歷下軍，何辯也？韓信襲齊，以身脂鼎，何訥也。」曰：「夫辯也者，自辯也。如辯人，幾矣！」,"Li Yiji convinced Liu Bang to seize the city of Chen Liu, and afterwards, the granary at Ao. He convinced King Tian Guang of Qi to surrender his troops at Lixia. What clever arguments! But when Han Xin launched a surprise attack on Qi, King Tian Guang put Li's body in the cauldron and boiled him down to a pool of grease. How dumb he was then!Yangzi said: Clever arguments are for convincing oneself. If you use them to convince others, they can be dangerous indeed!"
或問：「蒯通抵韓信，不能下，又狂之。」曰：「方遭信閉，如其抵！」曰：「巇可抵乎？」曰：「賢者司禮，小人司巇，況拊鍵乎？」,"Someone asked: Kuai Tong attempted drive Han Xin and Liu Bang apart, but was not able to do it, and so feigned madness and left. Yangzi said: At the time, he met with Han Xin's closed door. Such was his attempt to drive them apart!The other said: Can a crack not be driven open?Yangzi said: A worthy man takes charge of li. A small man takes charge of cracks. How much more does he attempt to pick open a locked door."
或問：「李斯盡忠，胡亥極刑，忠乎？」曰：「斯以留客，至作相，用狂人之言，從浮大海，立趙高之邪說，廢沙丘之正，阿意督責，焉用忠？」「霍？」曰：「始元之初，擁少帝之微，摧燕、上官之鋒，處廢興之分，堂堂乎忠，難矣哉！至顯，不終矣。」,"Someone said: Li Si was completely loyal to the Qin, but in the end Emperor Huhai executed him. What's the point of loyalty?Yangzi said: Li Si stayed in Qin as a guest of Lu Buwei and eventually became Prime Minister. Using the words of an alchemist to flatter the Emperor, he followed Qin Shi Huang on his tours of the four seas. Upon Qin Shi Huang's death, he let Zhao Gao's treacherous plan to replace the chosen successor stand, discarded the Emperor's official edict, assented to the idea and directed the orders. Where in this is loyalty?The other said: What about Huo Guang.Yangzi said: At the beginning of the Shiyuan era (86—80 B.C.), he acted as regent for the young Emperor Zhao, and destroyed Prince Yan and Shangguan's coup. After Zhao's untimely death, he stayed and played his part as regent, first deposing his first chosen successor and then installing Emperor Xuan. Appearing so courageous and august in his loyalty—but it's difficult! Because coming to the crimes of his wife Huo Xian, in the end, it wasn't so."
或問：「馮唐面文帝得廉頗、李牧不能用也，諒乎？」曰：「彼將有激也。親屈帝尊，信亞夫之軍，至頗、牧，曷不用哉？」「德？」曰：「罪不孥，宮不女，館不新，陵不墳。」,"Someone asked: Feng Tang met with Emperor Wen and told him that even if he had generals like Lian Po and Li Mu, he would not be able to use them. Was he not sincere?Yangzi said: He was raising the issue to arouse Emperor Wen's attention. Personally yielding himself with the honor of being Emperor, Emperor Wen supported Yafu's command of the army. Why could he not have used Lian Po and Li Mu?The other said: What about his de?Yangzi said: He did not punish the children of criminals, keep women in the palace, build new rooms in the palace or erect a large tomb for himself."
