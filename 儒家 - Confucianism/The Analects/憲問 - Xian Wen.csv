憲問恥。子曰：「邦有道，穀；邦無道，穀，恥也。」「克、伐、怨、欲不行焉，可以為仁矣？」子曰：「可以為難矣，仁則吾不知也。」,"Xian asked what was shameful. The Master said, ""When good government prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary - this is shameful.""

子曰：「有德者，必有言。有言者，不必有德。仁者，必有勇。勇者，不必有仁。」,"The Master said, ""The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle."""
南宮适問於孔子曰：「羿善射，奡盪舟，俱不得其死然；禹稷躬稼，而有天下。」夫子不答，南宮适出。子曰：「君子哉若人！尚德哉若人！」,"Nan Gong Kuo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, ""Yi was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Ji personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom."" The Master made no reply; but when Nan Gong Kuo went out, he said, ""A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!"""

He asked about Guan Zhong. ""For him,"" said the Master, ""the city of Pian, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Bo family, who though to the end of his life he had only coarse rice to eat did not utter a murmuring word."""

子路問成人。子曰：「若臧武仲之知，公綽之不欲，卞莊子之勇，冉求之藝，文之以禮樂，亦可以為成人矣。」曰：「今之成人者何必然？見利思義，見危授命，久要不忘平生之言，亦可以為成人矣。」,"Zi Lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, ""Suppose a man with the knowledge of Zang Wu Zhong, the freedom from covetousness of Gong Chuo, the bravery of Zhuang of Bian, and the varied talents of Ran Qiu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and music - such a one might be reckoned a COMPLETE man."" He then added, ""But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends - such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man."""
子問公叔文子於公明賈曰：「信乎夫子不言、不笑、不取乎？」公明賈對曰：「以告者過也。夫子時然後言，人不厭其言；樂然後笑，人不厭其笑；義然後取，人不厭其取。」子曰：「其然，豈其然乎？」,"The Master asked Gong Ming Jia  about Gong Ming Wen, saying, ""Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?"" Gong Ming Jia replied, ""This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth. My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking."" The Master said, ""So! But is it so with him?"""

May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?"" The Master said, ""The Duke Huan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots - it was all through the influence of Guan Zhong. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like his?"""
子貢曰：「管仲非仁者與？桓公殺公子糾，不能死，又相之。」子曰：「管仲相桓公，霸諸侯，一匡天下，民到于今受其賜。微管仲，吾其被髮左衽矣。豈若匹夫匹婦之為諒也，自經於溝瀆，而莫之知也。」,"Zi Gong said, ""Guan Zhong, I apprehend, was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Huan caused his brother Jiu to be killed, Guan Zhong was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Huan."" The Master said, ""Guan Zhong acted as prime minister to the duke Huan, made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Guan Zhong, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side. Will you require from him the small fidelity of common men and common women, who would commit suicide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing anything about them?"""
