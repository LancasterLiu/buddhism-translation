子曰：「五刑之屬三千，而罪莫大於不孝。要君者無上，非聖人者無法，非孝者無親。此大亂之道也。」,"The Master said, ""There are three thousand offenses against which the five punishments are directed, and there is not one of them greater than being unfilial.When constraint is put upon a ruler, that is the disowning of his superiority. When the authority of the sages is disallowed, that is the disowning of (all) law. When filial piety is put aside, that is the disowning of the principle of affection. These (three things) pave the way to anarchy."""
