子曰：「君子之事親孝，故忠可移於君。事兄悌，故順可移於長。居家理，故治可移於官。是以行成於內，而名立於後世矣。」,"The Master said, ""The filial piety with which the superior man serves his parents may be transferred as loyalty to the ruler. The fraternal duty with which he serves his elder brother may be transferred as submissive deference to elders. His regulation of his family may be transferred as good government in any official position. Therefore, when his conduct is thus successful in his inner (private) circle, his name will be established (and transmitted) to future generations."""
