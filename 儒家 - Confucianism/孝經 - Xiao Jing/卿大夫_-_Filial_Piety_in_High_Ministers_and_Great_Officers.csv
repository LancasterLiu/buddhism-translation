非先王之法服不敢服，非先王之法言不敢道，非先王之德行不敢行。是故非法不言，非道不行；口無擇言，身無擇行。言滿天下無口過，行滿天下無怨惡。三者備矣，然後能守其宗廟。蓋卿、大夫之孝也。《詩》云：「夙夜匪懈，以事一人。」,"""They do not presume to wear robes other than those appointed by the laws of the ancient kings, nor to speak words other than those sanctioned by their speech, nor to exhibit conduct other than that exemplified by their virtuous ways. Thus none of their words being contrary to those sanctions, and none of their actions contrary to the (right) way, from their mouths there comes no exceptionable speech, and in their conduct there are found no exceptionable actions. Their words may fill all under heaven, and no error of speech will be found in them. Their actions may fill all under heaven, and no dissatisfaction or dislike will be awakened by them. When these three things - (their robes, their words, and their conduct) - are all complete as they should be, they can then preserve their ancestral temples. This is the filial piety of high ministers and great officers.It is said in the Book of Poetry: He is never idle, day or night, in the service of the One man."""
