曾子曰：「甚哉，孝之大也！」子曰：「夫孝，天之經也，地之義也，民之行也。天地之經，而民是則之。則天之明，因地之利，以順天下。是以其教不肅而成，其政不嚴而治。先王見教之可以化民也，是故先之以博愛，而民莫遺其親，陳之德義，而民興行。先之以敬讓，而民不爭；導之以禮樂，而民和睦；示之以好惡，而民知禁。《詩》云：『赫赫師尹，民具爾瞻。』」,"The disciple Zeng said, ""Immense indeed is the greatness of filial piety!""The Master replied, ""Yes, filial piety is the constant (method) of Heaven, the righteousness of Earth, and the practical duty of Man. Heaven and earth invariably pursue the course (that may be thus described), and the people take it as their pattern. (The ancient kings) imitated the brilliant luminaries of heaven and acted in accordance with the (varying) advantages afforded by earth, so that they were in accord with all under heaven, and in consequence their teachings, without being severe, were successful, and their government, without being rigorous, secured perfect order.The ancient kings, seeing how their teachings could transform the people, set before them therefore an example of the most extended love, and none of the people neglected their parents. They set forth to them (the nature of) virtue and righteousness, and the people roused themselves to the practice of them. They went before them with reverence and yielding courtesy, and the people had no contentions. They led them on by the rules of propriety and by music, and the people were harmonious and benignant. They showed them what they loved and what they disliked, and the people understood their prohibitions.It is said in the Book of Poetry: Awe-inspiring are you, O Grand-Master Yin, And the people all look up to you."""
