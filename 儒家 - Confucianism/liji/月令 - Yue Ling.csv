Its days are jia and yi. Its divine ruler is Dai Hao, and the (attending) spirit is Gou-mang. Its creatures are the scaly. Its musical note is Jiao, and its pitch-tube is the Dai Cu. Its number is eight; its take is sour; its smell is rank. Its sacrifice is that at the door, and of the parts of the victim the spleen has the foremost place."
東風解凍，蟄蟲始振，魚上冰，獺祭魚，鴻雁來。,The east winds resolve the cold. Creatures that have been torpid during the winter begin to move. The fishes rise up to the ice. Otters sacrifice fish. The wild geese make their appearance.
天子居青陽左个。乘鸞路，駕倉龍，載青旗，衣青衣，服倉玉，食麥與羊，其器疏以達。,"The son of Heaven occupies the apartment on the left of the Qing Yang (Fane); rides in the carriage with the phoenix (bells), drawn by the azure-dragon (horses), and carrying the green flag; wears the green robes, and the (pieces of) green jade (on his cap and at his girdle pendant). He eats wheat and mutton. The vessels which he uses are slightly carved, (to resemble) the shooting forth (of plants)."
是月也，以立春。先立春三日，大史謁之天子曰：某日立春，盛德在木。天子乃齊。立春之日，天子親帥三公、九卿、諸侯、大夫以迎春於東郊。還反，賞公卿、諸侯、大夫於朝。命相布德和令，行慶施惠，下及兆民。慶賜遂行，毋有不當。乃命大史守典奉法，司天日月星辰之行，宿離不貸，毋失經紀，以初為常。,"In this month there takes place the inauguration of spring. Three days before this ceremony, the Grand recorder informs the son of Heaven, saying, 'On such and such a day is the inauguration of the spring. The energies of the season are fully seen in wood. On this the son of Heaven devotes himself to self-purification, and on the day he leads in person the three ducal ministers, his nine high ministers, the feudal princes (who are at court), and his Great officers, to meet the spring in the eastern suburb; and on their return, he rewards them all in the court. He charges his assistants to disseminate (lessons of) virtue, and harmonise the governmental orders, to give effect to the expressions of his satisfaction and bestow his favours; down to the millions of the people. Those expressions and gifts thereupon proceed, every one in proper (degree and direction). He also orders the Grand recorder to guard the statutes and maintain the laws, and (especially) to observe the motions in the heavens of the sun and moon, and of the zodiacal stars in which the conjunctions of these bodies take place, so that there should be no error as to where they rest and what they pass over; that there should be no failure in the record of all these things, according to the regular practice of early times."
是月也，天子乃以元日祈穀于上帝。乃擇元辰，天子親載耒耜，措之參保介之御間，帥三公、九卿、諸侯、大夫，躬耕帝藉。天子三推，三公五推，卿諸侯九推。反，執爵于大寢，三公、九卿、諸侯、大夫皆御，命曰：勞酒。,"In this month the son of Heaven on the first (hsin) day prays to God for a good year; and afterwards, the day of the first conjunction of the sun and moon having been chosen, with the handle and share of the plough in the carriage, placed between the man-at-arms who is its third occupant and the driver, he conducts his three ducal ministers, his nine high ministers, the feudal princes and his Great officers, all with their own hands to plough the field of God. The son of Heaven turns up three furrows, each of the ducal ministers five, and the other ministers and feudal princes nine. When they return, he takes in his hand a cup in the great chamber, all the others being in attendance on him and the Great officers, and says, 'Drink this cup of comfort after your toil.'"
是月也，天氣下降，地氣上騰，天地和同，草木萌動。王命布農事，命田舍東郊，皆修封疆，審端經術。善相丘陵阪險原隰土地所宜，五穀所殖，以教道民，必躬親之。田事既飭，先定準直，農乃不惑。,"In this month the vapours of heaven descend and those of the earth ascend. Heaven and earth are in harmonious co-operation. All plants bud and grow. The king gives orders to set forward the business of husbandry. The inspectors of the fields are ordered to reside in the lands having an eastward exposure, and (see that) all repair the marches and divisions (of the o-round), and mark out clearly the paths and ditches. They must skilfully survey the mounds and rising grounds, the slopes and defiles, the plains and marshes, determining what the different lands are suitable for, and where the different grains will grow best. They must thus instruct and lead on the people, themselves also engaging in the tasks. The business of the fields being thus ordered, the guiding line is first put in requisition, and the husbandry is carried on without error."
是月也，命樂正入學習舞。乃修祭典。命祀山林川澤，犧牲毋用牝。禁止伐木。毋覆巢，毋殺孩蟲、胎、夭、飛鳥。毋麑，毋卵。毋聚大眾，毋置城郭。掩骼埋胔。,"In this month orders are given to the chief director of Music to enter the college, and practise the dances (with his pupils). The canons of sacrifice are examined and set forth, and orders are given to sacrifice to the hills and forests, the streams and meres, care being taken not to use any female victims. Prohibitions are issued against cutting down trees. Nests should not be thrown down; unformed insects should not be killed, nor creatures in the Womb, nor very young creatures, nor birds just taking to the wing, nor fawns, nor should eggs be destroyed. No congregating of multitudes should be allowed, and no setting about the rearing of fortifications and walls. Skeletons should be covered up, and bones with the flesh attached to them buried."
是月也，不可以稱兵，稱兵必天殃。兵戎不起，不可從我始。毋變天之道，毋絕地之理，毋亂人之紀。,In this month no warlike operations should be undertaken; the undertaking of such is sure to be followed by calamities from Heaven. The not undertaking warlike operations means that they should not commence on our side. No change in the ways of heaven is allowed; nor any extinction of the principles of earth; nor any confounding of the bonds of men.
孟春行夏令，則雨水不時，草木蚤落，國時有恐。行秋令則其民大疫，猋風暴雨總至，藜莠蓬蒿并興。行冬令則水潦為敗，雪霜大摯，首種不入。,"If in the first month of spring the governmental proceedings proper to summer were carried out, the rain would fall unseasonably, plants and trees would decay prematurely, and the states would be kept in continual fear. If the proceedings proper to autumn were carried out, there would be great pestilence among the people; boisterous winds would work their violence; rain would descend in torrents; orach, fescue, darnel, and southernwood would grow up together. If the proceedings proper to winter were carried out, pools of water would produce their destructive effects, snow and frost would prove very injurious, and the first sown seeds would not enter the ground."
仲春之月，日在奎，昏弧中，旦建星中。其日甲乙，其帝大皞，其神句芒。其蟲鱗。其音角，律中夾鐘。其數八。其味酸，其臭膻，其祀戶，祭先脾。,"In the second month of spring, the sun is in Kui, the star culminating at dusk being Hu, and that culminating at dawn Jian-xing. Its days are jia and yi. Its divine ruler is Dai Hao, the attending spirit is Gou-mang. Its creatures are the scaly. Its musical note is Jiao, and its pitch-tube is the Jia Zhong. Its number is eight; its taste is sour; its smell is rank. Its sacrifice is that at the door, and of the parts of the victim the spleen has the foremost place."
始雨水，桃始華，倉庚鳴，鷹化為鳩。,The rain begins to fall. The peach tree begins to blossom. The oriole sings. Hawks are transformed into doves.
天子居青陽大廟，乘鸞路，駕倉龍，載青旗，衣青衣，服倉玉，食麥與羊，其器疏以達。,"The son of Heaven occupies the Qing Yang Grand Fane; rides in the carriage with the phoenix bells, drawn by the azure dragon-(horses), and bearing the green flag. He is dressed in the green robes, and wears the azure gems. He eats wheat and mutton. The vessels which he uses are slightly carved, (to resemble) the bursting forth (of nature)."
是月也，安萌芽，養幼少，存諸孤。擇元日，命民社。命有司省囹圄，去桎梏，毋肆掠，止獄訟。,"In this month, they keep both the young buds and those more advanced from being disturbed; they nourish both the young animals and those not fully grown; they especially watch over all orphans. The fortunate day is chosen, and orders are given to the people to sacrifice at their altars to the spirits of the ground. Orders are given to the (proper) officers to examine the prisons; to remove fetters and handcuffs; that there shall be no unregulated infliction of the bastinado; and that efforts shall be made to stop criminal actions and litigations."
是月也，玄鳥至。至之日，以大牢祠于高禖。天子親往，后妃帥九嬪御。乃禮天子所御，帶以弓韣，授以弓矢，于高禖之前。,"In this month the swallow makes its appearance. On the day of its arrival, the son of Heaven sacrifices to the first match-maker with a bull, a ram, and a boar. He goes to do so in person, with his queen and help-mates, attended by his nine ladies of honour. Peculiar courtesy is shown to those whom he has (lately) approached. Bow-cases have been brought, and a bow and arrows are given to each before (the altar of) the first match-maker."
是月也，日夜分。雷乃發聲，始電，蟄蟲咸動，啟戶始出。先雷三日，奮木鐸以令兆民曰：雷將發聲，有不戒其容止者，生子不備，必有凶災。日夜分，則同度量，鈞衡石，角斗甬，正權概。,"In this month day and night are equal. Thunder utters its voice, and the lightning begins to be seen. Insects in their burrows are all in motion, opening their doors and beginning to come forth. Three days before the thunder, a bell with a wooden tongue is sounded, to give notice to all the people. 'The thunder,' it is said, 'is about to utter its voice. If any of you be not careful of your behaviour, you shall bring forth children incomplete; there are sure to be evils and calamities.' At the equinox they make uniform the measures of length and capacity; the weight of 30 catties, the steelyard, and the weight of 120 catties. They correct the peck and bushel, the steelyard weights and the bushel-scraper."
是月也，耕者少舍。乃修闔扇，寢廟畢備。毋作大事，以妨農之事。,"In this month few of the husbandmen remain in their houses in the towns. They repair, however, their gates and doors, both of wood and wattles; and put their sleeping apartments and temples all in good repair. No great labours, which would interfere with the work of husbandry, should be undertaken."
是月也，毋竭川澤，毋漉陂池，毋焚山林。天子乃鮮羔開冰，先薦寢廟。上丁，命樂正習舞，釋菜。天子乃帥三公、九卿、諸侯、大夫親往視之。仲丁，又命樂正入學習舞。,"In this month (the fishermen) should not let the streams and meres run dry, nor drain off all the water from the dams and ponds, (in order to catch all the fish), nor should (the hunters) fire the hills and forests. The son of Heaven at this time offers a lamb (to the ruler of cold), and opens the (reservoirs of) ice. Before (using it generally), they offer some in their principal apartment or in the ancestral temple. On the first ting day orders are given to the chief director of Music to exhibit the civil dances and unfold the offerings of vegetables (to the inventor of music). The son of Heaven, at the head of the three ducal ministers, his nine high ministers, the feudal princes (at court), and his Great officers, goes in person to see the ceremony. On the second ting day orders are given again to the same chief to enter the college, and practise music (with his pupils)."
是月也，祀不用犧牲，用圭璧，更皮幣。,"In this month at the (smaller) services of supplication they do not use victims. They use offerings of jade, square and round, and instead (of victims) skins and pieces of silk."
仲春行秋令，則其國大水，寒氣總至，寇戎來征。行冬令，則陽氣不勝，麥乃不熟，民多相掠。行夏令，則國乃大旱，暖氣早來，蟲螟為害。,"If in this second month of spring the governmental proceedings proper to autumn were observed, there would be great floods, in the states; cold airs would be constantly coming; and plundering attacks would be frequent. If those of winter were observed, the warm and genial airs would be insufficient; the wheat would not ripen; and raids and strifes would be rife among the people. If those of summer were observed, there would be great droughts among the people; the hot airs would come too early; and caterpillars and other insects would harm the grain."
季春之月，日在胃，昏七星中，旦牽牛中。其日甲乙。其帝大皞，其神句芒。其蟲鱗。其音角，律中姑洗。其數八。其味酸，其臭膻。其祀戶，祭先脾。,"In the last month of spring, the sun is in Wei, the constellation culminating at dusk being Qi xing, and that culminating at dawn Qian-niu.

He is dressed in the green robes, and wears the azure gems. He eats wheat and mutton. The vessels which he uses are slightly carved, (to resemble) the bursting forth (of nature)."
是月也，天子乃薦鞠衣于先帝。命舟牧覆舟，五覆五反。乃告舟備具於天子焉，天子始乘舟。薦鮪于寢廟，乃為麥祈實。,"In this month the son of Heaven presents robes yellow as the young leaves of the mulberry tree to the ancient divine ruler (and his queen). Orders are given to the officer in charge of the boats to turn a boat bottom up. Five times he does so, and five times he turns it back again, after which he reports that it is ready for the son of Heaven, who then gets into it for the first time (this spring). He offers a snouted sturgeon (which he has caught) in the rear apartment of the ancestral temple, and also prays that the wheat may yield its produce."
是月也，生氣方盛，陽氣發泄，句者畢出，萌者盡達。不可以內。天子布德行惠，命有司發倉廩，賜貧窮，振乏絕，開府庫，出幣帛，周天下。勉諸侯，聘名士，禮賢者。,"In this month the influences of life and growth are fully developed; and the warm and genial airs diffuse themselves. The crooked shoots are all put forth, and the buds are unfolded. Things do not admit of being restrained. The son of Heaven spreads his goodness abroad, and carries out his kindly promptings. He gives orders to the proper officers to distribute from his granaries and vaults, giving their contents to the poor and friendless, and to relieve the needy and destitute; and to open his treasuries and storehouses, and to send abroad through all the nation the silks and other articles for presents, thus stimulating the princes of states to encourage the resort to them of famous scholars and show courtesy to men of ability and virtue."
是月也，命司空曰：時雨將降，下水上騰，循行國邑，周視原野，修利堤防，道達溝瀆，開通道路，毋有障塞。田獵罝罘、羅網、畢翳、餧獸之藥，毋出九門。,"In this month, he charges the superintendents of works, saying, 'The rains of the season will be coming down, and the waters beneath will be swelling up. Go in order over the states and visit the towns, inspecting everywhere the low and level grounds. Put the dykes and dams in good repair, clear the ditches and larger channels, and open all paths, allowing no obstruction to exist.' The nets used in hunting animals and birds, hand nets, archers' disguises, and injurious baits should not (in this month) issue from (any of) the nine gates."
是月也，命野虞毋伐桑柘。鳴鳩拂其羽，戴勝降於桑。具曲植籧筐。后妃齊戒，親東鄉躬桑。禁婦女毋觀，省婦使以勸蠶事。蠶事既登，分繭稱絲效功，以共郊廟之服，無有敢惰。,"In this month orders are given to the foresters throughout the country not to allow the cutting down of the mulberry trees and silk-worm oaks. About these the cooing doves clap their wings, and the crested birds light on them . The trays and baskets with the stands (for the worms and cocoons) are got ready. The queen, after vigil and fasting, goes in person to the eastern fields to work on the mulberry trees. She orders the wives and younger women (of the palace) not to wear their ornamental dresses, and to suspend their woman's-work, thus stimulating them to attend to their business with the worms. When this has been completed, she apportions the cocoons, weighs out (afterwards) the silk, on which they go to work, to supply the robes for the solstitial and other great religious services, and for use in the ancestral temple. Not one is allowed to be idle."
是月也，命工師令百工審五庫之量：金鐵，皮革筋，角齒，羽箭干，脂膠丹漆，毋或不良。百工咸理，監工日號；毋悖于時，毋或作為淫巧以蕩上心。,"In this month orders are given to the chiefs of works, to charge the workmen of their various departments to inspect the materials in the five storehouses: those of iron and other metals; of skins and hides and sinews; of horn and ivory; of feathers, arrows and wood (for bows); and of grease, glue, cinnabar, and varnish. (They are to see) that all these things be good. The workmen then labour at their several tasks. (The chiefs) inspect their work, and daily give them their orders. They must not produce anything contrary to what the time requires; nor can they practise a licentious ingenuity, which would dissipate the minds of their superiors."
是月之末，擇吉日，大合樂，天子乃率三公、九卿、諸侯、大夫親往視之。,"In the end of this month a fortunate day is chosen for a grand concert of music. The son of Heaven, at the head of the three ducal ministers, the nine high ministers, the feudal princes (at court), and his great officers, goes in person to witness it."

Three days before this ceremony, the Grand recorder informs the son of Heaven, saying, 'On such-and-such a day is the inauguration of summer. The energies of the season are most fully seen in fire.'

仲夏行冬令，則雹凍傷穀，道路不通，暴兵來至。行春令，則五穀晚熟，百螣時起，其國乃饑。行秋令，則草木零落，果實早成，民殃於疫。,"If, in the second month of summer, the governmental proceedings of winter were observed, hail and told would injure the grain; the roads would not be passable; and violent assaults of war would come. If the proceedings proper to spring were observed, the grains would be late in ripening; all kinds of locusts would continually be appearing; and there would be famine in the states.

There should be no undertaking of (such) great affairs, which will disturb the nourishing growth that is proceeding, nor any issuing of orders to be hereafter carried into effect. All these things will interfere with the business of husbandry, (which is specially dear to) the Spirits.

The son of Heaven also orders the leaders and commanders to choose men and sharpen weapons, to select and exercise those of distinguished merit, and to give their entire trust only to men whose services have been proved - thereby to correct all unrighteousness. (He instructs them also) to make enquiries about and punish the oppressive and insolent - thereby making it clear whom he loves and whom he hates, and giving effect to (the wishes of) the people, even the most distant from court."

If they do this, they shall be punished for their guilt without forgiveness."
孟冬行春令，則凍閉不密，地氣上泄，民多流亡。行夏令，則國多暴風，方冬不寒，蟄蟲復出。行秋令，則雪霜不時，小兵時起，土地侵削。,"If, in the first month of winter, the proceedings of government proper to spring were observed, the cold that shuts up all beneath it would not do so tightly; the vapours of the earth would rise up and go abroad; many of the people would wander away and disappear. If those proper to summer were observed, there would be many violent winds in the states; winter itself would not be cold; and insects would come forth again from their burrows. If those proper to autumn were observed, the snow and hoarfrost would come unseasonably; small military affairs would constantly be arising; and incursions and loss of territory would occur."
仲冬之月，日在斗，昏東壁中，旦軫中。其日壬癸。其帝顓頊，其神玄冥。其蟲介。其音羽，律中黃鍾。其數六。其味鹹，其臭朽。其祀行，祭先腎。,"In the second month of winter the sun is in Dou, the constellation culminating at dusk being the eastern Bi, and that culminating at dawn Zhen. Its days are ren and gui. Its divine ruler is Zhuan-xu, and the (attending) spirit is Xuan-ming. Its creatures are the shell-covered. Its musical note is Yu, and its pitch-tube is Huang Zhong. Its number is six. Its taste is salt. Its smell is that of things that are rotten. Its sacrifice is that at (the altar of) the path, and of the parts of the victim the kidneys have the foremost place."
冰益壯，地始坼。鶡旦不鳴，虎始交。,The ice becomes more strong. The earth begins to crack or split. The night bird ceases to sing. Tigers begin to pair.
天子居玄堂大廟，乘玄路，駕鐵驪，載玄旗，衣黑衣，服玄玉。食黍與彘，其器閎以奄。飭死事。命有司曰：土事毋作，慎毋發蓋，毋發室屋，及起大眾，以固而閉。地氣且泄，是謂發天地之房，諸蟄則死，民必疾疫，又隨以喪。命之曰暢月。,"The son of Heaven occupies the Grand Fane Xuan Tang; rides in the dark-coloured carriage, drawn by the iron black horses, and bearing the dark-coloured flag. He is dressed in the black robes, and wears the dark-coloured gems of jade. He eats millet and sucking-pig. The vessels which he uses are large and rather deep. All things relating to the dead are revised and regulated. Orders are given to the proper officer to the following effect: 'There should nothing be done in works of earth; care should be taken not to expose anything that is covered, nor to throw open apartments and houses, and rouse the masses to action; that all may be kept securely shut up. (Otherwise) the genial influences of earth will find vent, which might be called a throwing open of the house of heaven and earth. In this case all insects would die; and the people be sure to fall ill from Pestilence, and various losses would ensue.' This charge is said to be giving full development to the (idea of the) month."
是月也，命奄尹，申宮令，審門閭，謹房室，必重閉。省婦事毋得淫，雖有貴戚近習，毋有不禁。乃命大酋，秫稻必齊，麴蘗必時，湛熾必潔，水泉必香，陶器必良，火齊必得，兼用六物。大酋監之，毋有差貸。天子命有司祈祀四海大川名源淵澤井泉。,"In this month orders are given to the Director of the eunuchs to issue afresh the orders for the palace, to examine all the doors, inner and outer, and look carefully after all the apartments. They must be kept strictly shut. All woman's-work must be diminished, and none of an extravagant nature permitted. Though noble and nearly related friends should come to visit the inmates, they must all be excluded. Orders are given to the Grand superintendent of the preparation of liquors to see that the rice and other glutinous grains are all complete; that the leaven-cakes are in season; that the soaking and heating are cleanly conducted; that the water be fragrant; that the vessels of pottery be good; and that the regulation of the fire be right. These six things have all to be attended to, and the Grand superintendent has the inspection of them, to secure that there be no error or mistake. The son of Heaven issues orders to the proper officers to pray and sacrifice to (the spirits presiding over) the four seas, the great rivers (with their) famous sources, the deep tarns, and the meres, (all) wells and springs."

是月也，日短至。陰陽爭，諸生蕩。君子齊戒，處必掩身。身欲寧，去聲色，禁耆欲。安形性，事欲靜，以待陰陽之所定。蕓始生，荔挺出，蚯螾結，麋角解，水泉動。日短至，則伐木，取竹箭。,"In this month the shortest day arrives. The principle of darkness and decay (in nature) struggles with that of brightness and growth. The elements of life begin to move. Superior men give themselves to self-adjustment and fasting. They keep retired in their houses. They wish to be at rest in their persons; put away all indulgence in music and beautiful sights; repress their various desires; give repose to their bodies and all mental excitements. They wish all affairs to be quiet, while they wait for the settlement of those principles of darkness and decay, and brightness and growth. Rice begins to grow. The broom-sedge rises up vigorously. Worms curl. The moose-deer shed their horns. The springs of water are (all) in movement. When the shortest day has arrived, they fell trees, and carry away bamboos, (especially) the small species suitable for arrows."
是月也，可以罷官之無事、去器之無用者。涂闕廷門閭，筑囹圄，此所以助天地之閉藏也。,"In this month, offices in which there is no business may be closed, and vessels for which there is no use may be removed. They plaster (and repair) the pillars and gateways (of the palace), and the courtyard (within), and also doors and other gateways; rebuilding (also all) prisons, to co-operate with the tendency of nature to shut up and secure (the genial influences at this season)."
仲冬行夏令，則其國乃旱，氛霧冥冥，雷乃發聲。行秋令，則天時雨汁，瓜瓠不成，國有大兵。行春令，則蝗蟲為敗，水泉咸竭，民多疥癘。,"If in this second month of winter the proceedings of government proper to summer were observed, there would be droughts in the states; vapours and fogs would shed abroad their gloom, and thunder would utter its voice.

If those proper to spring were observed, locusts would work their harm; the springs would all become dry; and many of the people would suffer from leprosy and foul ulcers."

He is dressed in the black robes, and wears the dark-coloured gems of jade. He eats millet and sucking-pig. The vessels which he uses are large and rather deep. He issues orders to the proper officers to institute on a great scale all ceremonies against pestilence, to have (animals) torn in pieces on all sides, and (then) to send forth the ox of earth, to escort away the (injurious) airs of the cold. Birds of prey fly high and rapidly. They now offer sacrifices all round to (the spirits of) the hills and rivers, to the great ministers of the (ancient) deified sovereigns, and to the spirits of heaven (and earth)."
是月也，命漁師始漁，天子親往，乃嘗魚，先薦寢廟。冰方盛，水澤腹堅。命取冰，冰以入。令告民，出五種。命農計耦耕事，修耒耜，具田器。命樂師大合吹而罷。乃命四監收秩薪柴，以共郊廟及百祀之薪燎。,"In this month orders are given to the master of the Fishermen to commence the fishers' work. The son of Heaven goes in person (to look on). He partakes of the fish caught, first presenting some in the apartment at the back of the ancestral temple.

是月也，日窮於次，月窮於紀，星回於天。數將幾終，歲且更始。專而農民，毋有所使。天子乃與公、卿、大夫，共飭國典，論時令，以待來歲之宜。乃命太史次諸侯之列，賦之犧牲，以共皇天、上帝、社稷之饗。乃命同姓之邦，共寢廟之芻豢。命宰歷卿大夫至于庶民土田之數，而賦犧牲，以共山林名川之祀。凡在天下九州之民者，無不咸獻其力，以共皇天、上帝、社稷、寢廟、山林、名川之祀。,"In this month the sun has gone through all his mansions; the moon has completed the number of her conjunctions; the stars return to (their places) in the heavens. The exact length (of the year) is nearly completed, and the year will soon begin again. (It is said), 'Attend to the business of your husbandmen. Let them not be employed on anything else.' The son of Heaven, along with his ducal and other high ministers and his Great officers, revises the statutes for the states, and discusses the proceedings of the different seasons; to be prepared with what is suitable for the ensuing year. Orders are given to the Grand recorder to make a list of the princes of the states according to the positions severally assigned to them, and of the victims required from them to supply the offerings for the worship of God dwelling in the great heaven, and at the altars of (the spirits of) the land and grain.

季冬行秋令，則白露早降，介蟲為妖，四鄙入保。行春令，則胎夭多傷，國多固疾，命之曰逆。行夏令，則水潦敗國，時雪不降，冰凍消釋。,"If, in the last month of winter, the governmental proceedings proper to autumn were observed, the white dews would descend too early; the shelly creatures would appear in monstrous forms; throughout the four borders people would have to seek their places of shelter. If those proper to spring were observed, women with child and young children would suffer many disasters; throughout the states there would be many cases of obstinate disease; fate would appear to be adverse. If those proper to summer were observed, floods would work their ruin in the states; the seasonable snow would not fall, the ice would melt, and the cold disappear."
