有父之喪，如未沒喪而母死，其除父之喪也，服其除服。卒事，反喪服。,"When a man was wearing mourning for his father, if his mother died before the period was completed, he put off the mourning for his father (and assumed that proper for his mother). He put on, however, the proper dress when sacrificial services required it; but when they were over, he returned to the mourning (for his mother)."
雖諸父昆弟之喪，如當父母之喪，其除諸父昆弟之喪也，皆服其除喪之服。卒事，反喪服。,"When occasion occurred for wearing the mourning for uncles or cousins, if it arrived during the period of mourning for a parent, then the previous mourning was not laid aside, save when the sacrificial services in these cases required it to be so; and when they were finished, the mourning for a parent was resumed."
如三年之喪，則既顈，其練祥皆同。,"If during the three years' mourning (there occurred also another three years' mourning for the eldest son), then after the coarser girdle of the Jiong hemp had been assumed in the latter case, the sacrifices at the end of the first or second year's mourning for a parent might be proceeded with."
王父死，未練祥而孫又死，猶是附於王父也。,"When a grandfather had died, and his grandson also died before the sacrifices at the end of the first or second year had been performed, (his spirit-tablet) was still placed next to the grandfather's."
有殯，聞外喪，哭之他室。入奠，卒奠，出，改服即位，如始即位之禮。,"When a mourner, while the coffin was in the house, heard of the death of another relative at a distance, he went to another apartment and wailed for him. (Next day), he entered where the coffin was, and put down the offerings (to the deceased), after which he went out, changed his clothes, went to the other apartment, and repeated the ceremony of the day before."
大夫、士將與祭於公，既視濯，而父母死，則猶是與祭也，次於異宮。既祭，釋服出公門外，哭而歸。其它如奔喪之禮。如未視濯，則使人告。告者反，而後哭。如諸父昆弟姑姊妹之喪，則既宿，則與祭。卒事，出公門，釋服而後歸。其它如奔喪之禮。如同宮，則次於異宮。,"When a Great officer or another officer was about to take part in a sacrifice at his ruler's, if, after the inspection of the washing of the vessels to be used, his father or mother died, he still went to the sacrifice; but took his place in a different apartment. After the sacrifice he put off his (sacrificial) dress, went outside the gate of the palace, wailed, and returned to his own house. In other respects he acted as he would have done in hurrying to the mourning rites. If the parent's death took place before the inspection of the washing, he sent a messenger to inform the ruler of his position; and when he returned, proceeded to wail (for his deceased parent). When the death that occurred was that of an uncle, aunt, or cousin, if he had received the previous notice to fast, he went to the sacrifice; and when it was over, he went out at the ruler's gate, put off his (sacrificial) dress, and returned to his own house. In other respects he acted as if he had been hurrying to the mourning rites. If the deceased relative lived under the same roof with him, he took up his residence in other apartments."
曾子問曰：「卿大夫將為尸於公，受宿矣，而有齊衰內喪，則如之何？」孔子曰：「出舍乎公宮以待事，禮也。」,"Zeng-zi asked, 'When a high minister or Great officer is about to act the part of the personator of the dead at a sacrifice by his ruler, and has received instructions to pass the night previous in solemn vigil, if there occur in his own family occasion for him to wear the robe of hemmed sackcloth, what is he to do?' Confucius said, 'The rule is for him to leave his own house, and lodge in the ruler's palace till the service (for the ruler) is accomplished."
孔子曰：「尸弁冕而出，卿、大夫、士皆下之。尸必式，必有前驅。」,"Confucius said, 'When the personator of the dead comes forth in his leathern cap, or that with the square top, ministers, Great officers, and other officers, all should descend from their carriages when he passes. He should bow forward to them, and he should (also) have people going before him (to notify his approach, that people may get out of the way)."
父母之喪，將祭，而昆弟死；既殯而祭。如同宮，則雖臣妾，葬而後祭。祭，主人之升降散等，執事者亦散等。雖虞附亦然。,"During the mourning rites for a parent, when the occasion for one of the sacrifices was at hand, if a death occurred in the family of a brother or cousin, the sacrifice was postponed till the burial of the dead had taken place. If the cousin or brother were an inmate of the same palace with himself, although the death were that of a servant or concubine, the party postponed his sacrifice in this way, At the sacrifice the mourner went up and descended the steps with only one foot on each, all assisting him, doing the same. They did so even for the sacrifice of Repose, and to put the spirit-tablet in its place."
自諸侯達諸士，小祥之祭，主人之酢也嚌之；眾賓兄弟，則皆啐之。大祥：主人啐之，眾賓兄弟皆飲之，可也。,"From the feudal rulers down to all officers, at the sacrifice at the end of the first year's mourning for a parent, when the chief mourner took the cup offered to him by the chief among the visitors, he raised it to his teeth, while the visitors, brothers, and cousins all sipped the cups presented to them. After the sacrifice at the end of the second year, the chief mourner might sip his cup, while all the visitors, brothers, and cousins might drink off their cups."
凡侍祭喪者，告賓祭薦而不食。,"The attendants at the sacrifices during the funeral rites give notice to the visitors to present the offerings, of which, however, they did not afterwards partake."
子貢問喪，子曰：「敬為上，哀次之，瘠為下。顏色稱其情；戚容稱其服。」請問兄弟之喪，子曰：「兄弟之喪，則存乎書策矣。」,"Zi-gong asked about the rites of mourning (for parents), and the Master said, 'Reverence is the most important thing; grief is next to it; and emaciation is the last. The face should wear the appearance of the inward feeling, and the demeanour and carriage should be in accordance with the dress.' He begged to ask about the mourning for a brother, and the Master said, 'The rites of mourning for a brother are to be found in the tablets where they are written.'"
君子不奪人之喪，亦不可奪喪也。,"A superior man will not interfere with the mourning of other men to diminish it, nor will he do so with his own mourning."
孔子曰：「少連、大連善居喪，三日不怠，三月不解，期悲哀，三年憂。東夷之子也。」,"Confucius said, 'Shao-lian and Da-lian demeaned themselves skilfully during their mourning (for their parents). During the (first) three days they were alert; for the (first) three months they manifested no weariness; for the (first) year they were full of grief; for the (whole) three years they were sorrowful. (And yet) they belonged to one of the rude tribes on the East'."
三年之喪，言而不語，對而不問：廬，堊室之中，不與人坐焉；在堊室之中，非時見乎母也，不入門。疏衰皆居堊室不廬。廬，嚴者也。,"During the three years of mourning (for his father), (a son) might speak, but did not discourse; might reply, but did not ask questions. In the shed or the unplastered apartment he sat (alone), nobody with him. While occupying that apartment, unless there were some occasion for him to appear before his mother, he did not enter the door (of the house). On all occasions of wearing the sackcloth with its edges even, he occupied the unplastered apartment, and not the shed. To occupy the shed was the severest form in mourning."
妻視叔父母，姑姊妹視兄弟，長、中、下殤視成人。,(The grief) in mourning for a wife was like that for an uncle or aunt; that for a father's sister or one's own sister was like that for a cousin; that for any of the three classes of minors dying prematurely was as if they had been full-grown.
親喪外除，兄弟之喪內除。,"The mourning for parents is taken away (at the end of three years), (but only) its external symbols; the mourning for brothers (at the end of one year), (and also) internally."
視君之母與妻，比之兄弟。發諸顏色者，亦不飲食也。,"(The period of mourning) for ruler's mother or wife is the same as that for brothers. But (beyond) what appears in the countenance is this, that (in the latter case) the mourners do not eat and drink (as usual)."
免喪之外，行於道路，見似目瞿，聞名心瞿。吊死而問疾，顏色戚容必有以異於人也。如此而後可以服三年之喪。其餘則直道而行之，是也。,"After a man has put off the mourning (for his father), if, when walking along the road, he sees one like (his father), his eyes look startled. If he hear one with the same name, his heart is agitated. In condoling with mourners on occasion of a death, and inquiring for one who is ill, there will be something in his face and distressed manner different from other men. He who is thus affected is fit to wear 'the three years' mourning. So far as other mourning is concerned, he may walk right on (without anything) having such an effect on him."
祥，主人之除也，於夕為期，朝服。祥因其故服。,"The sacrifice at the end of the second year is signalized by the principal mourner putting off his mourning dress. The evening (before), he announces the time for it, and puts on his court robes, which he then wears at the sacrifice."
子游曰：「既祥，雖不當縞者必縞，然後反服。」,"Zi-you said, 'After the sacrifice at the end of the second year, although the mourner should not wear the cap of white silk, (occasions may occur when) he must do so. Afterwards he resumes the proper dress.'"
當袒，大夫至，雖當踴，絕踴而拜之，反改成踴，乃襲。於士，既事成踴，襲而後拜之，不改成踴。,"(At the mourning rites of an officer), if, when he had bared his breast, a Great officer arrived (on a visit of condolence), although he might be engaged in the leaping, he put a stop to it, and went to salute and bow to him. Returning then, he resumed his leaping and completed it, after which he readjusted his dress and covered his breast. In the case of a visit from another officer, he went on with his leaping, completed it, readjusted his upper dress, and then went to salute and bow to him, without having occasion to resume and complete the leaping."
上大夫之虞也，少牢。卒哭成事，附，皆大牢。下大夫之虞也，特牲。卒哭成事，附，皆少牢。,"At the sacrifice of Repose for a Great officer of the highest grade, there were offered a boar and a ram; at the conclusion of the wailing, and at the placing of his spirit-tablet, there was, in addition, the bull. On the similar occasions for a Great officer of the lowest grade, there was in the first case a single victim, and in the others the boar and the ram."
祝稱卜葬虞，子孫曰哀，夫曰乃，兄弟曰某，卜葬其兄弟曰伯子某。,"In consulting the tortoise-shell about the burial and sacrifice of Repose, the style of the petition was as follows - A son or grandson spoke of himself as 'the sorrowing,' (when divining about his father or grandfather); a husband (divining about his wife) said, 'So and so for so and so;' an elder brother about a younger brother, simply said, 'So and so;' a younger brother about an elder brother said, 'For my elder brother, so and so.'"
古者，貴賤皆杖。叔孫武叔朝，見輪人以其杖關轂而輠輪者，於是有爵而後杖也。,"Anciently, noble and mean all carried staffs. (On one occasion) Shu-sun Wu-shu, when going to court, saw a wheelwright put his staff through the nave of a wheel, and turn it round. After this (it was made a rule that) only men of rank should carry a staff."
鑿巾以飯，公羊賈為之也。,"(The custom of) making a hole in the napkin (covering the face of the dead) by which to introduce what was put into the mouth, was begun by Gong yang Jia."
冒者何也？所以掩形也。自襲以至小斂，不設冒則形，是以襲而後設冒也。,"What were the grave-clothes (contributed to the dead)? The object of them was to cover the body. From the enshrouding to the slighter dressing, they were not put on, and the figure of the body was seen. Therefore the corpse was first enshrouded, and afterwards came the grave-clothes."
或問於曾子曰：「夫既遣而包其餘，猶既食而裹其餘與？君子既食，則裹其餘乎？」曾子曰：「吾子不見大饗乎？夫大饗，既饗，卷三牲之俎歸於賓館。父母而賓客之，所以為哀也！子不見大饗乎！」非為人喪，問與賜與？,"Someone asked Zeng-zi, 'After sending away to the grave the offerings to the dead, we wrap up what up remains; is this not like a man, after partaking of a meal, wrapping-what is left (to take with him)? Does a gentleman do such a thing? Zeng-zi said, 'Have you not seen what is done at a great feast? At a great feast, given by a Great officer, after all have partaken, he rolls up what is left on the stands for the three animals, and sends it to the lodgings of his guests. When a son treats his parents in this way as his (honoured) guests, it is an expression of his grief (for their loss). Have you, Sir, not seen what is done at a great feast?' Excepting at men's funeral rites, do they make such inquiries and present such gifts as they then do?"
三年之喪，以其喪拜；非三年之喪，以吉拜。,"At the three years' mourning, the mourner bows to his visitors in the manner appropriate to the occasion; at the mourning of a shorter period, he salutes them in the usual way."
三年之喪，如或遺之酒肉，則受之必三辭。主人衰絰而受之。如君命，則不敢辭，受而薦之。喪者不遺人，人遺之，雖酒肉，受也。從父昆弟以下，既卒哭，遺人可也。,"During the three years' mourning, if any one sent wine or flesh to the mourner, be received it after declining it thrice; he received it in his sackcloth and band. If it came from the ruler with a message from him, he did not presume to decline it; he received it and presented it (in his ancestral temple). One occupied with such mourning did not send any gift, but when men sent gifts to him he received them. When engaged in the mourning rites for an uncle, cousin, or brother, and others of a shorter period, after the wailing was concluded, he might send gifts to others."
縣子曰：「三年之喪，如斬。期之喪，如剡。」,"Xian-zi said, 'The pain occasioned by the mourning for three years is like that of beheading; that arising from the one year's mourning, is like the stab from a sharp weapon.'"
三年之喪，雖功衰不吊，自諸侯達諸士。如有服而將往哭之，則服其服而往。期之喪，十一月而練，十三月而祥，十五月禫。練則吊。,"During the one year's mourning, in the eleventh month, they put on the dress of silk, which was called lian; in the thirteenth month they offered the xiang sacrifice, and in the same month that called tan - which concluded the mourning. During the mourning for three years, even though they had occasion to assume the dress proper for the nine months' mourning, they did not go to condole (with the other mourners). From the feudal lords down to all officers, if they had occasion to dress and go to wail (for a relative newly deceased), they did so in the dress proper to the mourning for him, After putting on the lian silk, they paid visits of condolence."
既葬，大功吊，哭而退，不聽事焉。期之喪，未喪，吊於鄉人。哭而退，不聽事焉。功衰吊，待事不執事。小功緦，執事不與於禮。,"When one was occupied with the nine months' mourning, if the burial had been performed, he might go and condole with another mourner, retiring after he had wailed without waiting for any other part of the mourner's proceedings. During the mourning for one year, if before the burial one went to condole with another in the same district, he withdrew after he had wailed, without waiting for the rest of the proceedings. If condoling during the mourning for nine months, he waited to see the other proceedings, but did not take part in them. During the mourning for five months or three months, he waited to assist at the other proceedings, but did not take part in the (principal) ceremony."
相趨也，出宮而退。相揖也，哀次而退。相問也，既封而退。相見也。反哭而退。朋友，虞附而退。吊，非從主人也。四十者執綍：鄉人五十者從反哭，四十者待盈坎。,"When one (was condoling with) another whom he had been accustomed to pass with a hasty step, (at the interment of his dead relative), he retired when the bier had passed out from the gate of the temple. If they had been on bowing terms, he retired when they had reached the station for wailing. If they had been in the habit of exchanging inquiries, he retired after-the coffin was let down into the grave. if they had attended court together, he went back to the house with the other, and wailed with him. If they were intimate friends, he did not retire till after the sacrifice of Repose, and the placing of the spirit tablet of the deceased in the shrine. Condoling friends did not (merely) follow the principal mourner. Those who were forty (or less) held the ropes when the coffin was let down into the grave. Those of the same district who were fifty followed him back to the house and wailed; and those who were forty waited till the grave was filled up."
喪食雖惡必充饑，饑而廢事，非禮也；飽而忘哀，亦非禮也。視不明，聽不聰，行不正，不知哀，君子病之。故有疾飲酒食肉，五十不致毀，六十不毀，七十飲酒食肉，皆為疑死。,"During mourning, though the food might be bad, the mourner was required to satisfy his hunger with it. If for hunger he had to neglect anything, this was contrary to the rules. If he through satiety forgot his sorrow, that also was contrary to the rules. It was a distress to the wise men (who made the rules) to think that a mourner should not see or hear distinctly; should not walk correctly or be unconscious of his occasion for sorrow; and therefore (they enjoined) that a mourner, when ill, should drink wine and eat flesh; that people of fifty should do nothing to bring on emaciation; that at sixty they should not be emaciated; that at seventy they should drink liquor and eat flesh - all these rules were intended as preventives against death."
有服，人召之食，不往。大功以下，既葬，適人，人食之，其黨也食之，非其黨弗食也。功衰食菜果，飲水漿，無鹽酪。不能食食，鹽酪可也。,"If one, while in mourning, was invited by another to eat with him, he did not go while wearing the nine months' mourning or that of a shorter period; if the burial had taken place, he might go to another party's house. If that other party belonged to his relative circle, and wished him to eat with him, he might do so; if he did not belong to that circle, he did not eat with him. While wearing the mourning of nine months, one might eat vegetables and fruits, and drink water and congee, using no salt or cream. If he could not eat dry provisions, he might use salt or cream with them."
孔子曰：「身有瘍則浴，首有創則沐，病則飲酒食肉。毀瘠為病，君子弗為也。毀而死，君子謂之無子。」,"Confucius said, 'If a man have a sore on his body, he should bathe. If he have a wound on his head, he should wash it. If he be ill, he should drink liquor and eat flesh. A superior man will not emaciate himself so as to be ill. If one die from such emaciation, a superior man will say of him that he has failed in the duty of a son.'"
非從柩與反哭，無免於堩。,"Excepting when following the carriage with the bier to the grave, and returning from it, one was not seen on the road with the mourning cap, which was used instead of the ordinary one."
凡喪，小功以上，非虞附練祥，無沐浴。,"During the course of mourning, from that worn for five months and more, the mourner did not wash his head or bathe, excepting for the sacrifice of Repose, the placing the spirit-tablet in the shrine, the assuming the dress of lian silk, and the sacrifice at the end of a year."
疏衰之喪，既葬，人請見之，則見；不請見人。小功，請見人可也。大功不以執摯。唯父母之喪，不辟涕泣而見人。,"During mourning rites, when the sackcloth with the edges even was worn, after the burial, if one asked an interview with the mourner, he saw him, but he himself did not ask to see any person. He might do so when wearing the mourning of five months. When wearing that for nine months, he did not carry the introductory present in his hand (when seeking an interview). It was only when wearing the mourning for a parent that the mourner did not avoid seeing any one, (even) while the teats were running from him."
三年之喪，祥而從政；期之喪，卒哭而從政；九月之喪，既葬而從政；小功緦之喪，既殯而從政。,"A man while wearing the mourning for three years might execute any orders of government after the sacrifice at the end of a year. One mourning for a year, might do so when the wailing was ended; one mourning for nine months, after the burial; one mourning for five months or three, after the encoffining and dressing."
曾申問於曾子曰：「哭父母有常聲乎？」曰：「中路嬰兒失其母焉，何常聲之有？」,"Zeng Shen asked Zeng-zi, saying, 'In wailing for a parent, should one do so always in the same voice?' The answer was, 'When a child has lost its mother on the road, is it possible for it to think about the regular and proper voice?'"
卒哭而諱。王父母兄弟，世父叔父，姑姊妹。子與父同諱。母之諱，宮中諱。妻之諱，不舉諸其側；與從祖昆弟同名則諱。,"After the wailing was ended, there commenced the avoiding of certain names. (An officer) did not use the name of his (paternal) grandfather or grandmother, of his father's brothers or uncles; of his father's aunts or sisters. Father and son agreed in avoiding all these names. The names avoided by his mother the son avoided in the house. Those avoided by his wife he did not use when at. her side. If among them there were names which had been borne by his own paternal great-grandfather or great-grand-uncles, he avoided them (in all places)."
以喪冠者，雖三年之喪，可也。既冠於次，入哭踴，三者三，乃出。,"When (the time for) capping (a young man) came during the time of the mourning rites, though they were those for a parent, the ceremony might be performed. After being capped in the proper place, the subject went in, wailed and leaped,--three times each bout, and then came out again."
大功之末，可以冠子，可以嫁子。父，小功之末，可以冠子，可以嫁子，可以取婦。己雖小功，既卒哭，可以冠，取妻；下殤之小功，則不可。,"At the end of the nine months' mourning, it was allowable to cap a son or to marry a daughter. A father at the end of the five months' mourning, might cap a son, or marry a daughter, or take a wife (for a son). Although one himself were occupied with the five months' mourning, yet when he had ended the wailing, he might be capped, or take a wife. If it were the five months' mourning for one who had died in the lowest degree of immaturity, he could not do so."
凡弁絰，其衰侈袂。,"Whenever one wore the cap of skin with a sackcloth band (in paying a visit of condolence), his upper garment of mourning had the large sleeves."
父有服，宮中子不與於樂。母有服，聲聞焉不舉樂。妻有服，不舉樂於其側。大功將至，辟琴瑟。小功至，不絕樂。,"When the father was wearing mourning, a son, who lived in the same house with him, kept away from all music. When the mother was wearing it, the son might listen to music, but not play himself. When a wife was wearing it, the son, (her husband), did not play music by her side. When an occasion for the nine months' mourning was about to occur, the lute and cithern were laid aside. If it were only an occasion for the five months' mourning, music was not stopped."
姑姊妹，其夫死，而夫黨無兄弟，使夫之族人主喪。妻之黨，雖親弗主。夫若無族矣，則前後家，東西家；無有，則里尹主之。或曰：主之，而附於夫之黨。,"When an aunt or sister died (leaving no son), if her husband (also) were dead, and there were no brother or cousin in his relative circle, some other of her husband's more distant relatives was employed to preside at her mourning rites. None of a wife's relatives, however near, could preside at them. If no distant relative even of her husband could be found, then a neighbour, on the east or the west, was employed. If no such person (suitable) could be found, then the head man of the neighbourhood presided. Some say, 'One (of her relatives) might preside, but her tablet was placed by that of the (proper) relative of her husband.'"
麻者不紳，執玉不麻。麻不加於采。,The girdle was not used along with the sackcloth band. That band could not be used by one who carried in his hand his jade-token; nor could it be used along with a dress of various colours.
國禁哭，則止朝夕之奠。即位自因也。,"On occasions of prohibitions issued by the state (in connexion with the great sacrifices), the wailing ceased; as to the offerings deposited by the coffin, morning and evening, and the repairing to their proper positions, mourners proceeded as usual."
童子哭不偯，不踴，不杖，不菲，不廬。,"A lad, when wailing, did not sob or quaver; did not leap; did not carry a staff; did not wear the straw sandals; and did not occupy the mourning shed."
孔子曰：「伯母、叔母，疏衰，踴不絕地。姑姊妹之大功，踴絕於地。如知此者，由文矣哉！由文矣哉！」,"Confucius said, 'For grand-aunts the mourning with the edges even is worn, but the feet in leaping are not lifted from the ground. For aunts and sisters the mourning for nine months is worn, but the feet in leaping are lifted from the ground. If a man understands these things, will he not (always) follow, the right forms of ceremonies? Will he not do so?'"
世柳之母死，相者由左。世柳死，其徒由右相。由右相，世柳之徒為之也。,"When the mother of Yi Liu died, his assistants in the rites stood on his left; when Yi Liu died, they stood on his right. The practice of the assistants (at funeral rites) giving their aid on the right, originated from the case of Yi Liu."
天子飯，九貝；諸侯七，大夫五，士三。,"The mouth of the son of Heaven was stuffed after death with nine shells; that of a feudal lord, with seven; that of a Great officer, with five; and that of an ordinary officer, with three."
士三月而葬，是月也卒哭；大夫三月而葬，五月而卒哭；諸侯五月而葬，七月而卒哭。士三虞，大夫五，諸侯七。,"An officer was interred after three months, and the same month the wailing was ended. A Great officer was interred (also) after three months, and after five months the wailing was ended. A prince was interred after five months, and after seven the wailing was ended. For an officer the sacrifice of Repose was offered three times; for a Great officer, five times; and for a feudal prince, seven times."
諸侯使人吊，其次：含襚賵臨，皆同日而畢事者也，其次如此也。,"A feudal lord sent a messenger to offer his condolences; and after that, his contributions for the mouth, the grave-clothes, and the carriage. All these things were transacted on the same day, and in the order thus indicated."
卿大夫疾，君問之無算；士一問之。君於卿大夫，比葬不食肉，比卒哭不舉樂；為士，比殯不舉樂。,"When a high minister or Great officer was ill, the ruler inquired about him many times. When an ordinary officer was ill, he inquired about him once. When a Great officer or high minister was buried, the ruler did not eat flesh; when the wailing was finished, he did not have music. When an officer was encoffined, he did not have music."
升正柩，諸侯執綍五百人，四綍，皆銜枚，司馬執鐸，左八人，右八人，匠人執羽葆御柩。大夫之喪，其升正柩也，執引者三百人，執鐸者左右各四人，御柩以茅。,"After they had gone up, and made the bier ready, in the case of the burial of a feudal lord, there were 500 men to draw the ropes. At each of the four ropes they were all gagged. The minister of War superintended the clappers; eight men with these walking on each side of the bier. The chief artizan, carrying a shade of feathers, guided the progress (of the procession). At the burial of a Great officer, after they had gone up and made the bier ready, 300 men drew the ropes; four men with their clappers walked on each side of the bier; and its progress was guided (by the chief artizan) with a reed of white grass in his hand."
孔子曰：「管仲鏤簋而朱紘，旅樹而反坫，山節而藻梲。賢大夫也，而難為上也。晏平仲祀其先人。豚肩不掩豆。賢大夫也，而難為下也。君子上不僭上，下不偪下。」,"Confucius said, 'Guan Zhong had carving on the square vessels for holding the grain of his offerings, and red ornaments for his cap; he set up a screen where he lodged on the way, and had a stand of earth on which the cups he had used, in giving a feast, were replaced; he had hills carved on the capitals of his pillars, and. pondweed on the lower pillars supporting the rafters'. He was a worthy Great officer, but made it difficult for his superiors (to distinguish themselves from him). Yan Ping-zhong, in sacrificing to his father and other progenitors, used only the shoulders of a pig, not large enough to cover the dish. He was a worthy Great officer, but made it difficult for his inferiors (to distinguish themselves from him). A superior man will not encroach on (the observances of) those above him, nor put difficulties in the way of those below him.'"
婦人非三年之喪，不逾封而吊。如三年之喪，則君夫人歸。夫人其歸也以諸侯之吊禮，其待之也若待諸侯然。夫人至，入自闈門，升自側階，君在阼。其他如奔喪禮然。,"Excepting on the death of her father or mother, the wife (of a feudal lord) did not cross the boundaries of the state to pay a visit of condolence. On that occasion she did so, and went back to her original home, where she used the ceremonies of condolence proper to a feudal lord, and she was treated as one. When she arrived, she entered by the women's gate, and went up (to the reception hall) by steps at the side (of the principal steps), the ruler receiving her at the top of the steps on the east.

The answer was, 'The people of the whole state appeared to be mad; I do not know in what I could find pleasure.' The Master said, 'For their hundred days' labour in the field, (the husbandmen) receive this one day's enjoyment (from the state);--this is what you do not understand.

To keep it now strung and now unstrung was the way of Wen and Wu.'"
