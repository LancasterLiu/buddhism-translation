話說老太太見這些傢伙什物都是自己的，不覺歡喜，痰迷心竅，昏絕於地。家人、媳婦和丫鬟、娘子都慌了，快請老爺進來。范舉人三步作一步走來看時，連叫母親不應，忙將老太太抬放床上，請了醫生來。醫生說：「老太太這病是中了臟，不可治了。」連請了幾個醫生，都是如此說，范舉人越發慌了。夫妻兩個，守著哭泣，一面製備後事。挨到黃昏時分，老太太淹淹一息，歸天去了，。合家忙了一夜。,"When Fan Jin's mother realized that everything in the house was hers, overcome with joy she fell senseless to the ground. The maids and her daughter-in-law, thrown into confusion, hastily summoned their master. Fan Jin hurried in, calling his mother, but she did not answer. At once he had her laid on the bed and sent for a doctor.「The old lady's vital organs have been affected,」 said the doctor. 「She is beyond saving.」Fan Jin called in several more physicians, but their diagnosis was the same, and he was in despair. As he and his wife watched by the bedside, weeping, he gave orders for the funeral; and when evening came the old lady breathed her last, so that the whole household was in a ferment all night."
次日，請將陰陽徐先生來寫了七單，老太太是犯三七，到期該請僧人追薦。大門上掛了白布球；新貼的廳聯都用白紙糊了。合城紳衿都來弔唁。請了同案的魏好古，穿著衣巾，在前廳陪客，胡老爹上不得臺盤，只好在廚房裏，或女兒房裏，幫著量白布、秤肉，亂竄。,"The next day they called in a diviner, and found that the seventh was the old lady's unlucky number. On the third seventh day (the twenty-first), therefore, they must invite monks to say masses. Balls of white cloth were hung over the front gate, and the new scrolls in the halls were pasted over with white paper. All the local gentry came to offer their condolences, and Fan Jin asked his fellow candidate Wei Hao-ku, in scholar's dress, to receive guests in the front hall. Butcher Hu was not up to appearing in public, but he bustled about between the kitchen and his daughter's room, helping to measure the white cloth or weigh meat."
到得二七過了，范舉人念舊，拿了幾兩銀子，交與胡屠戶，託他仍舊到集上庵裏請平日相與的和尚做攬頭，請大寺八眾僧人來念經，拜「梁皇懺」，放焰口，追薦老太太生天。屠戶拿著銀子，一直走到集上庵裏滕和尚家。恰好大寺裏僧官慧敏也在那裏坐著。僧官因有田在左近，所以常在這庵裏起坐。滕和尚請屠戶坐下，言及：「前日新中的范老爺得病在小庵裏，那日貧僧不在家，不曾候得；多虧門口賣藥的陳先生燒了些茶水，替我做個主人。」胡屠戶道：「正是，我也多謝他的膏藥。今日不在這裏？」滕和尚道：「今日不曾來。」又問道：「范老爺那病隨即就好了，卻不想又有老太太這一變。胡老爹這幾十天想總是在那裏忙？不見來集上做生意。」,"When the second seventh day had passed, Fan Jin gave his father-in-law a few taels of silver and told him to go to the temple in the market to ask a monk there whom he knew to invite other monks from the big monastery to recite the Buddhist scriptures, chant intercessions and say masses so that Mrs. Fan's soul might go to heaven.Butcher Hu took the silver and went straight to the temple in the market where Monk Teng lived. There he found Abbot Huei Min from the monastery, too; for the abbot, who owned land nearby, often dropped in at the temple.Monk Teng invited Butcher Hu to sit down, and said, 「Mr. Fan was taken ill in front of my temple just after he passed the examination, but I was out that day and could not do anything for him. Luckily Mr. Chen the apothecary was on hand. He made some tea for him and acted as host in my place.」「That's right,」 said the butcher. 「I also had some of his ointment, and was very grateful for it too. He's not here today, is he?」「He hasn't come today,」 said the monk. 「Mr. Fan soon got over his disorder; but the old lady's seizure was very unexpected. You must have been busy at home recently, Mr. Hu. We haven't seen you doing any business in the market.」"
胡屠戶道：「可不是麼？自從親家母不幸去世，合城鄉紳，那一個不到他家來？就是我主顧張老爺、周老爺，在那裏司賓，大長日子，坐著無聊，只拉著我說閒話，陪著喫酒喫飯；見了客來，又要打躬作揖，累個不了。我是個閑散慣了的人，不耐煩作這些事！欲待躲著些──難道是怕小婿怪！惹紳衿老爺們看喬了，說道：『要至親做甚麼呢？』」說罷，又如此這般把請僧人做齋的話說了。和尚聽了，屁滾尿流，慌忙燒茶，下麵；就在胡老爹面前轉託僧官去約僧眾，並備香、燭、紙馬、寫法等事。胡屠戶喫過麵去。,"「Yes. Since the sad death of Mr. Fan's mother, all the local gentry have called; and my former customers, the honourable Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zhou, have been in charge of the ceremonies. They sit there the whole day long with nothing to do, just making conversation with me, the three of us eating and drinking together. Whenever a guest comes, I have to bow and greet him — I'm sick and tired of it all. I'm an easygoing man, and I've no patience with all that. I'd like to keep out of the way. My son-in-law wouldn't mind, but those gentlemen would probably think it strange. 'What use is a relative like this?' they might say.」Then he told the monk that Mr. Fan wanted to invite him to say masses. The moment the monk heard this, he was beside himself with excitement and bustled officiously off to make tea and prepare noodles for Butcher Hu. And then, in the butcher's presence, he asked the abbot to notify the other monks and to prepare incense, candles, paper horses and all that was necessary. Butcher Hu finished his noodles and left."
僧官接了銀子，纔待進城，走不到一里多路，只聽得後邊一個人叫道：「慧老爺，為甚麼這些時不到莊上來走走？」僧官忙回過頭來看時，是佃戶何美之。何美之道：「你老人家這些時這等財忙！因甚事總不來走走？」僧官道：「不是，我也要來，只因城裏張大房裏想我屋後那一塊田，又不肯出價錢，我幾次回斷了他。若到莊上來，他家那佃戶又走過來嘴嘴舌舌，纏個不清。我在寺裏，他有人來尋我，只回他出門去了。」何美之道：「這也不妨。想不想由他，肯不肯由你。今日無事，且到莊上去坐坐。況且老爺前日煮過的那半隻火腿，吊在灶上，已經走油了；做的酒，也熟了；不如消繳了他罷。今日就在莊上歇了去，怕怎的？」和尚被他說的口裏流涎，那腳由不得自己，跟著他走到莊上。何美之叫渾家煮了一隻母雞，把火腿切了，酒舀出來盪著。和尚走熱了，坐在天井內，把衣服脫了一件，敞著懷，腆著個肚子，走出黑津津一頭一臉的肥油。,"The abbot took the silver and set off for the city. Before he had gone half a mile, however, he heard someone calling: 「Abbot Huei Min! Why don't you come to our village?」 Turning his head, he saw that it was his tenant farmer, He Mei-zhi.「You seem to be very busy nowadays,」 said He. 「Why don't you ever drop in to see us?」「I would like to come,」 said the abbot. 「But Mr. Zhang in the city wants that field behind my house, and won't pay a fair price for it. I have had to refuse him several times. If I go to your village, his tenants there will start making no end of trouble, while if he sends men to the monastery to look for me, I can simply say that I am out.」「Never mind that,」 said He. 「He may want the land, but he can't force you to sell. You're not busy today. Come to the village for a chat. That half leg of ham we cooked the other day is hanging in the kitchen waiting to be eaten, and the wine we brewed is ready too. We might as well finish them up. You can sleep in the village tonight. What are you afraid of?」The abbot's mouth watered at these words, and his legs carried him along of their own volition. When they reached the village, Ho told his wife to cook a chicken, slice the ham and heat the wine. The abbot was warm after his walk, and sitting down in the yard pulled open his clothes to cool his chest and belly. His greasy face was glistening."
須臾，整理停當，何美之捧出盤子，渾家拎著酒，放在桌子上擺下。和尚上坐，渾家下陪，何美之打橫，把酒來斟。喫著，說起三五日內要往范府替老太太做齋。何美之渾家說道：「范家老奶奶，我們自小看見他的，是個和氣不過的老人家；只有他媳婦兒，是莊南頭胡屠戶的女兒，一雙紅鑲邊的眼睛，一窩子黃頭髮。那日在這裏住，鞋也沒有一雙，夏天靸著個蒲窩子，歪腿爛腳的。而今弄兩件『尸皮子』穿起來，聽見說做了夫人，好不體面。你說那裏看人去！」,"Soon the food was ready. He Mei-zhi carried out the dishes and his wife the wine. The abbot sat at the head of the table, Mrs. He at the foot and He at the side to pour out wine. As they ate, the abbot told them how in a few days' time he was going to Mr. Fan's house to say masses for the old lady's soul.「I knew Mr. Fan's mother when I was a child,」 said Mrs. He. 「She was an old dear. But his wife—the daughter of Butcher Hu of the south end of this village—with her dingy hair and red-rimmed eyes was a regular slattern. She never wore proper shoes, just shuffled about in straw sandals all summer. Yet now she will wear furs and be a fine lady. Fancy that!」"
正喫得興頭，聽得外面敲門甚兇，何美之道：「是誰？」和尚道：「美之，你去看一看。」何美之纔開了門，七八個人一齊擁了進來。看見女人、和尚一桌子坐著，齊說道：「好快活，和尚、婦人，大青天白日調情！好僧官老爺！知法犯法！」何美之喝道：「休胡說！這是我田主人！」眾人一頓罵道：「田主人？連你婆子都有主兒了！」不由分說，拿條草繩，把和尚精赤條條，同婦人一繩綑了，將個槓子，穿心抬著，連何美之也帶了。來到南海縣前一個關帝廟前戲臺底下，和尚同婦人拴做一處。候知縣出堂報狀。眾人押著何美之出去，和尚悄悄叫他報與范府。,"They were enjoying their meal when they heard a violent knocking on the gate.「Who is it?」 called He Mei-zhi.「Go and have a look, Mei-zhi,」 said the abbot.But no sooner had He opened the gate when seven or eight men rushed in. At the sight of the woman and the abbot drinking together at one table, they shouted, 「Having a good time, aren't you? A monk carrying on with a woman in broad daylight! A fine abbot you are—knowing the law but breaking it.」「Stow that nonsense!」 cried He Mei-zhi. 「This is my landlord.」Then they all swore at him. 「Your landlord, eh? Does he have the run of your wife as well as your land?」Without listening to the others' protests, they took a hempen rope and tied up the abbot, half-naked as he was, with the woman. Then they haled them off, together with He Mei-zhi, to Nanhai County Court. There, the abbot and the woman, still tied together, were pushed up to a stage in front of a temple to wait for the magistrate, while Ho was thrown out. The abbot, however, had asked him in a whisper to go to Mr. Fan's house to report what had happened."
范舉人因母親做佛事，和尚被人拴了，忍耐不得，隨即拿帖子向知縣說了。知縣差班頭將和尚解放，女人著交美之領了家去；一班光棍帶著，明日早堂發落。眾人慌了，求張鄉紳帖子在知縣處說情，知縣准了，早堂帶進，罵了幾句，扯一個淡，趕了出去。和尚同眾人倒在衙門口用了幾十兩銀子。,"Because the abbot was to say masses for his mother, Fan Jin was impatient of any delay. He immediately wrote a letter to the magistrate, who sent a runner to release the abbot, let He Mei-zhi take his wife home, and order the men who had accused them to appear in court the next day. These men took fright, and asked Mr. Zhang to put in a word for them with the magistrate. Accordingly, the next morning when their case came up, the magistrate simply gave them a brief warning and drove them out. The upshot of the whole matter was that both the abbot and Mr. Zhang's tenants had to bribe the yamen officials with several dozen taels of silver."
僧官先去范府謝了，次日方帶領僧眾來鋪結壇場，掛佛像，兩邊十殿閻君。喫了開經麵，打動鐃鈸、叮噹，念了一卷經，擺上早齋來。八眾僧人，連司賓的魏相公，共九位，坐了兩席。纔喫著，長班報：「有客到！」魏相公丟了碗出去迎接進來，便是張、周兩位鄉紳，烏紗帽，淺色員領，粉底皂靴。魏相公陪著一直拱到靈前去了。,"The abbot went to Fan Jin's house to thank him, and the next day took all the other monks there. They prepared an altar, on it set an image of Buddha, and on each side ranged the Kings of Hell. After eating noodles they clashed cymbals and chanted a chapter of the sutra. Then they sat down to their midday meal. The monks and Wei Hao-ku, who was master of ceremonies, were sitting at two tables eating when a servant announced that guests had arrived. When Wei put down his bowl and went out to welcome them, he found that they were Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zhou, wearing gauze caps, light-coloured gowns and black shoes with white soles. Wei Hao-Gu took them to bow before the shrine, after which they went inside."
內中一個和尚向僧官道：「方纔進去的，就是張大房裏靜齋老爺。他和你是田鄰，你也該過去問訊一聲纔是。」僧官道：「也罷了！張家是甚麼有意思的人！想起我前日這一番是非，那裏是甚麼光棍？就是他的佃戶。商議定了，做鬼做神，來弄送我；不過要簸掉我幾兩銀子，好把屋後的那一塊田賣與他！使心用心，反害了自身！落後縣裏老爺要打他莊戶，一般也慌了，腆著臉，拿帖子去說，惹的縣主不喜歡！」又道：「他沒脊骨的事多哩！就像周三房裏，做過巢縣家的大姑娘，是他的外甥女兒。三房裏曾託我說媒，我替他講西鄉裏封大戶家，好不有錢。張家硬主張著許與方纔這窮不了的小魏相公，因他進個學，又說他會作個甚麼詩詞。前日替這裏作了一個薦亡的疏，我拿了給人看，說是倒別了三個字。像這都是作孽！眼見得二姑娘也要許人家了，又不知撮弄與個甚麼人！」說著，聽見靴底響，眾和尚擠擠眼，僧官就不言語了。兩位鄉紳出來，同和尚拱一拱手，魏相公送了出去。眾和尚喫完了齋，洗了臉和手，吹打拜懺，行香放燈，施食散花，跑五方，整整鬧了三晝夜，方纔散了。光陰彈指，七七之期已過，范舉人出門謝了孝。,"One of the monks said to the abbot, 「That was Mr. Zhang who went in just now. You and he own land next to each other, so you ought to have greeted him.」「Not I,」 said the abbot. 「It's better not to cross Mr. Zhang's path. My trouble the other day wasn't the work of any gang, but of his tenants. Mr. Zhang had put them up to it. It was all a plot to squeeze so much silver out of me that I'd have to sell the land behind my house. But Mr. Zhang, for all his tricks, only injured himself in the end; because when the magistrate wanted to beat his tenants, he lost his head and went, shamefaced, with his visiting card to beg them off. The magistrate was not at all pleased.」「Mr. Zhang has done many unprincipled things,」 the abbot went on. 「For instance, the daughter of Mr. Zhou, who used to be magistrate of Chao County, is Mr. Zhang's niece. The Zhou family asked me to arrange a match for her, and I spoke to the Feng family in the next village—a very wealthy family. But then Mr. Zhang insisted on giving the girl to this penniless young Mr. Wei, just because he had passed the prefectural examination and is supposed to be able to write poems. But a few days ago he wrote an intercession for the departed for Mr. Fan, and when I showed it to people they said he had written three characters wrongly; it was disgraceful. Soon the second daughter is to be married. Heaven knows what kind of husband they will get her.」Just then the monks, hearing footsteps, winked to the abbot to stop talking. The two gentlemen came out, nodded in farewell, and were seen out by Wei Hao-gu. Then the monks finished eating, washed their faces, and all together blew trumpets, clashed cymbals, bowed before Buddha, burnt incense, lit tapers, spread rice, scattered flowers and performed their other rites. They kept this up for three days and three nights. After that the forty-nine days of mourning passed very quickly, and Fan Jin came out to thank those who had taken part."
一日，張靜齋來候問，還有話說。范舉人叫請在靈前一個小書房裏坐下，穿著衰絰，出來相見，先謝了喪事裏諸凡相助的話。張靜齋道：「老伯母的大事，我們做子姪的理應效勞。想老伯母這樣大壽歸天，也罷了；只是誤了世先生此番會試。看來，想是祖塋安葬了？可曾定有日期？」范舉人道：「今年山向不利，只好來秋舉行。但費用尚在不敷。」張靜齋屈指一算：「銘旌是用周學臺的銜。墓志託魏朋友將就做一篇，卻是用誰的名？其餘殯儀、桌席、執事、吹打，以及雜用、飯食、破土、謝風水之類，須三百多銀子。」正算著，捧出飯來喫了。,"One day Mr. Zhang called, and asked to speak to Mr. Fan. He was invited into a small library in front of the shrine. Presently Mr. Fan came out in his mourning clothes, and began by thanking him for all his assistance during the mourning.「Closely connected as we are, it was my duty to attend to your mother's funeral,」 said Mr. Zhang. 「Since your mother had a long life, she must have gone happily to heaven. Only this has delayed you in taking the final examination. No doubt you will have her buried by your ancestral tombs. Have you fixed on a date?」「This year is not propitious,」 said Fan Jin. 「We shall have to wait for next autumn. But I haven't got enough money.」Mr. Zhang reckoned on his fingers. On the funeral banner they could use Commissioner Zhou's name. Wei Hao-Gu could write the epitaph—but whose name should they use for it? Then there would be the cost of the funeral. Feasts, musicians and all the rest, with the food, payment to the gravediggers and geomancer, would mount up to over three hundred taels of silver. While he was still counting, tea was served."
張靜齋又道：「三載居廬，自是正理；但世先生為安葬大事，也要到外邊設法使用，似乎不必拘拘。現今高發之後，並不曾到貴老師處一候。高要地方肥美，或可秋風一二。弟意也要去候敝世叔，何不相約同行？一路上車舟之費，弟自當措辦，不須世先生費心。」范舉人道：「極承老先生厚愛，只不知大禮上可行得？」張靜齋道：「禮有經，亦有權，想沒有甚麼行不得處。」范舉人又謝了。,"Presently Mr. Zhang brought the subject up again. 「Of course, the proper thing is to remain in retirement for three years,」 he said. 「But on account of the funeral expenses, I think you would be justified in trying to raise some money. There is no need to be too scrupulous. Since your great success, you have not yet been to see your honourable patron; and Gaoyao County is extremely rich—we may be able to borrow some money there. I want to visit him too, so why don't we go together? I'll be responsible for all the expenses on the road and see that you're not troubled with them.」「This is exceedingly kind of you,」 said Fan Jin. 「But I am not sure whether it is the correct procedure.」「The correct procedure varies according to circumstances,」 replied Mr. Zhang. 「I see no reason why you shouldn't go.」 Then Fan Jin thanked Mr. Zhang again."
張靜齋約定日期，雇齊夫馬，帶了從人，取路往高要縣進發。於路上商量說：「此來，一者見老師；二來，老太夫人墓誌，就要借湯公的官銜名字。」不一日，進了高要城。那日知縣下鄉相驗去了，二位不好進衙門，只得在一個關帝廟裏坐下，那廟正修大殿，有縣裏工房在內監工。工房聽見縣主的相與到了，慌忙迎到裏面客位內坐著，擺上九個茶盤來。工房坐在下席，執壺斟茶。,"They settled a date for the journey, hired horses and, accompanied by attendants, set off for Gaoyao County. On the road they decided to make use of this visit to their patron to borrow his name for the epitaph. In a few days they reached the city of Gaoyao; but since the magistrate happened to have gone into the country to make an investigation, they were unable to enter the yamen and had to sit down in a temple to wait. The central hall of that temple was under repair, and the county foreman was there supervising the work. When he heard that friends of the magistrate had come, he hastily invited them into the guest room. Nine plates of refreshments were served, and the foreman poured tea for them."
喫了一回，外面走進一個人來，方巾闊服，粉底皂靴，蜜蜂眼，高鼻梁，落腮鬍子。那人一進了門，就叫把茶盤子撤了；然後與二位敘禮坐下。動問那一位是張老先生，那一位是范老先生。二人各自道了姓名。那人道：「賤姓嚴，舍下就在咫尺。去歲宗師案臨，倖叨歲薦，與我這湯父母是極好的相與。二位老先生想都是年家故舊？」二位各道了年誼師生，嚴貢生不勝欽敬。工房告過失陪，那邊去了。,"Presently a man came in wearing a scholar's cap, wide gown and black shoes with white soles. He had bulging eyes, a prominent nose and a beard. As soon as this man came in he ordered the attendants to clear away the tea things. Then, after greeting Fan Jin and Mr. Zhang, he sat down and asked them their names. When they had introduced themselves, the stranger said, 「My name is Yan, and I live nearby. Last year, when my patron came to supervise the examination, I was lucky enough to be chosen senior licentiate. I am a good friend of Magistrate Tang's. No doubt you are both old friends of his?」Fan Jin and Mr. Zhang mentioned their relation to Magistrate Tang, and Senior Licentiate Yan appeared quite overwhelmed. The foreman excused himself and left."
嚴家家人掇了一個食盒來，又提了一瓶酒，桌上放下，揭開盒蓋，九個盤子，都是雞、鴨、糟魚、火腿之類。嚴貢生請二位老先生上席，斟酒奉過來，說道：「本該請二位老先生降臨寒舍。一來蝸居恐怕褻尊；二來就要進衙門去，恐怕關防有礙。故此備個粗碟，就在此處談談，休嫌輕慢。」二位接了酒道：「尚未奉謁，倒先取擾。」嚴貢生道：「不敢，不敢。」立著要候乾一杯。二位恐怕臉紅，不敢多用，喫了半杯放下。嚴貢生道：「湯父母為人廉靜慈祥，真乃一縣之福。」張靜齋道：「是；敝世叔也還有些善政麼？」,"One of Yan's servants brought in a hamper and a bottle of wine which he placed on the table. In the hamper were nine varieties of chicken, duck, salted fish and ham. Senior Licentiate Yan invited them to take the seats of honour and, offering them wine, said, 「I should have invited you to my poor home, but I felt it was unworthy of you; and, since you have to go to the yamen presently, I wanted to avoid unnecessary delay. So I have just provided a simple meal, in order that we may enjoy some conversation here. I hope you won't take this amiss.」Taking the wine cups from him, the two scholars said, 「We have never called on you, yet we are accepting your hospitality.」 Senior Licentiate Yan protested politely and remained standing until they had drunk, but Fan Jin and Mr. Zhang did not dare drink much for fear their faces would turn red. They put down their cups half full.「Magistrate Tang is kind and benevolent,」 said Yan. 「He is a great blessing to the county.」「Yes, he seems to have accomplished much here,」 said Mr. Zhang."
嚴貢生道：「老先生，人生萬事，都是個緣法，真個勉強不來的。湯父母到任的那日，敝處闔縣紳衿，公搭了一個綵棚，在十里牌迎接。弟站在綵棚門口。須臾，鑼、旗、傘、扇、吹手、夜役，一隊一隊，都過去了。轎子將近，遠遠望見老父母兩朵高眉毛，一個大鼻梁，方面大耳，我心裏就曉得是一位豈弟君子。卻又出奇：幾十人在那裏同接，老父母轎子裏兩隻眼只看著小弟一個人。那時有個朋友，同小弟並站著，他把眼望一望老父母，又把眼望一望小弟，悄悄問我：『先年可曾認得這位父母？』小弟從實說：『不曾認得。』他就癡心，只道父母看的是他，忙搶上幾步，意思要老父母問他甚麼。不想老父母下了轎，同眾人打躬，倒把眼望了別處，纔曉得從前不是看他，把他羞的要不的。次日，小弟到衙門去謁見，老父母方纔下學回來，諸事忙作一團，卻連忙丟了，叫請小弟進去，換了兩遍茶，就像相與過幾十年的一般。」,"「Gentlemen,」 said Yan, 「human life is ordained by fate, and cannot be changed. When Magistrate Tang first came here, all the gentlemen of the county erected a pavilion three miles from the city to welcome him. I was standing at the pavilion door. Group after group with gongs, banners, canopies, fans, trumpets and many attendants passed by, then the magistrate's sedan-chair approached; and as soon as I saw His Honour's arched eyebrows, big nose, square face and large ears, I knew he must be a true gentleman. The remarkable thing, however, was that though there were dozens of people there to welcome him, he had eyes only for me. A scholar who was standing by looked from the magistrate to me and whispered, 'Did you know His Honour before?' I answered truthfully that I did not. Then he was fool enough to think that it was at him the magistrate was looking, and hastily stepped forward hoping to be spoken to. But when Magistrate Tang got down from the chair, greeted us all and looked past him, he realized that he had been mistaken and was most mortified. The next day I called at the yamen, and although His Honour had just returned from the county school and had a great deal of business to attend to, he immediately set it all aside and invited me in. He offered me tea twice, as if we had known each other fox years.」"
張鄉紳道：「總因你先生為人有品望，所以敝世叔相敬。近來自然時時請教。」嚴貢生道：「後來倒也不常進去。實不相瞞，小弟只是一個為人率真，在鄉里之間，從不曉得占人寸絲半粟的便宜，所以歷來的父母官，都蒙相愛。湯父母容易不大喜會客，卻也凡事心照。就如前月縣考，把二小兒取在第十名，叫了進去，細細問他從的先生是那個，又問他可曾定過親事，著實關切！」,"「It must be because of your integrity that my uncle respects you so much,」 said Mr. Zhang. 「Recently, no doubt, he has frequently asked your advice.」「As a matter of fact, I haven't been to his office much lately,」 said Yan. 「Frankly, I'm a straightforward fellow. Because I don't know how to cheat the villagers of an inch of silk or a grain of rice, all the magistrates have liked me. So though Magistrate Tang doesn't care for visitors as a general rule, there is a good understanding between him and me. For example, in the county examination the other month, when my son was placed tenth, His Honour called him in, questioned him carefully as to who his tutor was and whether he was engaged to be married or not, and took a great interest in him.」"
范舉人道：「我這老師看文章是法眼；既然賞鑑令郎，一定是英才可賀。」嚴貢生道：「豈敢，豈敢。」又道：「我這高要，是廣東出名縣分。一歲之中，錢糧、耗羨，花、布、牛、驢、漁船、田房稅，不下萬金。」又自拿手在桌上畫著，低聲說道：「像湯父母這個作法，不過八千金；前任潘父母做的時節，實有萬金。他還有些枝葉，還用著我們幾個要緊的人。」說著，恐怕有人聽見，把頭別轉來望著門外。,"「My patron is an excellent judge of compositions,」 put in Fan Jin. 「If he praised your son's composition, the young man must have real talent. I congratulate you.」「Not at all,」 said the senior licentiate. 「Gaoyao is one of the most famous counties in Guangdong,」 he continued. 「In one year the taxes on grain, flowers, cloth, buffaloes, donkeys, fishing-boats, land, houses and so on come to more than ten thousand taels.」 Then, tracing figures on the table with his finger, he added in a low voice, 「It seems that Magistrate Tang's methods only produce eight thousand taels, whereas Magistrate Pan who was here before him made ten thousand taels. There are still some ways in which he could make use of some of us leading citizens.」 Fearing someone might be listening, he turned to the door."
一個蓬頭赤足的小使走了進來，望著他道：「老爺，家裏請你回去。」嚴貢生道：「回去做甚麼？」小廝道：「早上關的那口豬，那人來討了，在家裏吵哩。」嚴貢生道：「他要豬，拿錢來！」小廝道：「他說豬是他的。」嚴貢生道：「我知道了。你先去罷。我就來。」那小廝又不肯去。張、范二位道：「既然府上有事，老先生竟請回罷。」嚴貢生道：「二位老先生有所不知，這口豬原是舍下的……」纔說得一句，聽見鑼響，一齊立起身來說道：「回衙了。」,"Just then a tousled, barefoot servant-boy walked in and said, 「Master, they want you to go home.」「What for?」 asked the senior licentiate.「That man has come to ask for the pig we shut in this morning. He's wrangling with everyone in the house.」「If he wants the pig, let him pay for it.」「He says it's his.」「All right,」 snapped the senior licentiate. 「You go first, and I'll come presently.」But the boy was unwilling to go back without him, and Mr. Zhang and Mr. Fan said, 「Since you have business at home, don't let us detain you.」「You gentlemen may not realize it,」 said Yan, 「but that pig is really mine.」At that moment they heard the sound of gongs and stood up, exclaiming, 「His Honour has come back!」"
二位整一整衣帽。叫管家拿著帖子。向貢生謝了擾。一直來到宅門口，投進帖子去。知縣湯奉接了帖子，一個寫「世侄張師陸」，一個寫「門生范進」，自心裏沈吟道：「張世兄屢次來打秋風，甚是可厭；但這回同我新中的門生來見，不好回他。」吩咐快請。兩人進來，先是靜齋見過，范進上來敘師生之禮。湯知縣再三謙讓，奉坐喫茶，同靜齋敘了些闊別的話；又把范進的文章稱贊了一番，問道：「因何不去會試？」范進方纔說道：「先母見背，遵制丁憂。」,"The two scholars adjusted their clothes and caps, called their attendants to take their cards, thanked Yan again, and went straight to the yamen. Magistrate Tang received their cards, on one of which was written 「Your nephew Zhang Shilu」 and on the other 「Your student Fan Jin.」「Zhang has come time and again to get money: he is a confounded nuisance,」 he thought. 「Still, since he has come with my newly successful student today, I had better not send him away.」 He ordered them to be invited in.First Mr. Zhang paid his respects, then Fan Jin saluted his patron. Magistrate Tang politely declined their homage, then invited them to sit down and drink tea. After exchanging some remarks with Mr. Zhang, he praised Fan Jin's essay and asked, 「Why did you not sit for the higher examination?」「My mother has died,」 Fan Jin explained, 「and I am in mourning.」"
湯知縣大驚，忙叫換去了吉服；拱進後堂，擺上酒來。席上燕窩、雞、鴨，此外就是廣東出的柔魚、苦瓜，也做兩碗。知縣安了席坐下，用的都是銀鑲杯箸。范進退前縮後的不舉杯箸，知縣不解其故。靜齋笑說：「世先生因尊制，想是不用這個杯箸。」知縣忙叫換去，換了一個磁杯，一雙象箸來。范進又不肯舉。靜齋道：「這個箸也不用。」隨即換了一雙白顏色竹子的來，方纔罷了。知縣疑惑他居喪如此盡禮，倘或不用葷酒，卻是不曾備辦。後來看見他在燕窩碗裏揀了一個大蝦元子送在嘴裏，方纔放心，因說道：「卻是得罪的緊。我這敝教，酒席沒有甚麼喫得，只這幾樣小菜，權且用個便飯。敝教只是個牛羊肉，又恐貴教老爺們不用，所以不敢上席。現今奉旨禁宰耕牛，上司行來牌票甚緊，衙門裏都也莫得喫。」掌上燭來，將牌拿出來看著。一個貼身的小廝在知縣耳跟前悄悄說了幾句話，知縣起身向二位道：「外邊有個書辦回話，弟去一去就來。」,"Magistrate Tang gave a start, and hastily called for a plain gown to change into, then bowed them into an inner room Wine was brought and the table spread with birds'-nests, chicken, duck and two dishes of local fish and vegetables cooked in the Guangzhouese manner. They took their places at the table; but the cups and chopsticks were inlaid with silver, and Fan Jin hesitated to use them. The magistrate was puzzled, until Mr. Zhang told him with a laugh, 「On account of his mourning, Mr. Fan thinks he should not use these cups and chopsticks.」 The magistrate at once ordered them to be changed for a porcelain cup and ivory chopsticks; but still Fan Jin would not eat.「He does not use these chopsticks either,」 said Mr. Zhang.Finally plain bamboo chopsticks were produced, and all was well.Seeing how strictly Fan Jin observed the rules of mourning, Magistrate Tang was afraid he would not eat meat, and there was nothing else prepared. But to his relief, the magistrate saw Fan Jin pop a large shrimp ball from the dish of birds'-nests into his mouth.「I have been very remiss,」 said Magistrate Tang. 「We Moslems have no good dishes, only this simple fare. The only meat our religion allows us to eat is beef and mutton, but we dare not offer these to guests for fear they may not like them. Now we have received an imperial decree forbidding the slaughter of cows, and our superiors have ordered us to see that this rule is strictly enforced. So even in the yamen there is no beef.」 Candles were brought, and they read the orders on the subject."
去了一時，只聽得吩咐道：「且放在那裏。」回來又入席坐下，說了失陪；向張靜齋道：「張世兄，你是做過官的，這件事正該商之於你，就是斷牛肉的話。方纔有幾個教親，共備了五十斤牛肉，請出一位老師夫來求我，說是要斷盡了，他們就沒有飯喫，求我略鬆寬些，叫做『瞞上不瞞下』，送五十斤牛肉在這裏與我。卻是受得受不得？」張靜齋道：「老世叔，這句話斷斷使不得的了。你我做官的人，只知有皇上，那知有教親？想起洪武年間，劉老先生……」湯知縣道：「那個劉老先生？」靜齋道：「諱基的了。他是洪武三年開科的進士，『天下有道』三句中的第五名。」范進插口道：「想是第三名？」靜齋道：「是第五名。那墨卷是弟讀過的。後來入了翰林。洪武私行到他家，就如『雪夜訪普』的一般。恰好江南張王送了他一罈小菜，當面打開看，都是些瓜子金。洪武聖上惱了，說道：『他以為天下事都靠著你們書生！』到第二日，把劉老先生貶為青田縣知縣，又用毒藥擺死了。這個如何了得！」,"Just then an attendant whispered something into the magistrate's ear, at which he got up and excused himself, saying he would be back presently. In a few minutes they heard him give the order, 「Put it there!」 Then he came in and sat down again at the table, apologizing for his absence.「Mr. Zhang, you have held official posts,」 said Magistrate Tang. 「I would like your opinion on this. It's in connection with the prohibition of the sale of beef. Just now several Moslems got an old man to bring me fifty catties of beef and to plead with me saying that if I stop the sale of beef they will be forced out of business; and begging me to be more lenient. They want me, in fact, to shut my eyes to an illegal transaction. And they have sent this beef here. Should I accept it or not?」「I should say certainly not, sir,」 replied Zhang. 「We officials owe allegiance only to the emperor, not to friends of the same faith. This reminds me of Mr. Liu in the reign of Hong Wu.」「Which Mr. Liu?」 asked the magistrate.「Liu Chi. He passed the palace examination in the third year of the reign, coming fifth on the list.」「I thought he came third,」 put in Fan Jin.「No,」 Zhang contradicted him. 「Fifth. I read his essay. Later he entered the Han Lin Academy. One day Emperor Hong Wu went to his house in disguise, just like the emperor in the old story who called on his friend one snowy night. But that same day Prince Zhang of Jiangnan sent Liu a pitcher of pickled vegetables, and Liu opened it in the emperor's presence only to find that it was full of gold. The emperor was very angry and said, 'He seems to think that scholars can control the state.' The next day he degraded Liu Chi to the post of magistrate of Qingtien, and had him poisoned. No, no, you can't accept the beef!」"
知縣見他說的口若懸河，又是本朝確切典故，不由得不信；問道：「這事如何處置？」張靜齋道：「依小侄愚見，世叔就在這事上出個大名。今晚叫他伺候，明日早堂，將這老師夫拿進來，打他幾十個板子，取一面大枷枷了，把牛肉堆在枷上，出一張告示在傍，申明他大膽之處。上司訪知，見世叔一絲不苟，陞遷就在指日。」知縣點頭道：「十分有理。」當下席終，留二位在書房住了。,"When the magistrate heard Zhang talk so glibly about one of the memorable events of that dynasty, giving all manner of circumstantial details, he could not but believe him. 「How would you deal with the situation then?」 he asked.「In my humble opinion, this may enable you to win fame,」 said Zhang. 「Keep the old man here tonight. Tomorrow morning bring his case before the court, and give him several dozen strokes; then have him pilloried and pile the beef on him, posting up a notice by his side making his guilt clear. When your superiors see how incorruptible you are, your promotion will be assured.」The magistrate nodded. 「Quite right,」 he said. Then the feast came to an end, and he lodged them in the library."
次日早堂，頭一起帶進來是一個偷雞的積賊。知縣怒道：「你這奴才，在我手裏犯過幾次，總不改業！打也不怕，今日如何是好！」因取過硃筆來，在他臉上寫了「偷雞賊」三個字，取一面枷枷了，把他偷的雞，頭向後，尾向前，捆在他頭上，枷了出去。纔出得縣門，那雞屁股裏喇的一聲，痾出一拋稀屎來，從頭顱上淌到鼻子上，鬍子沾成一片，滴到枷上。兩邊看的人多笑。第二起叫將老師夫上來，大罵一頓「大膽狗奴」，重責三十板，取一面大枷，把那五十斤牛肉都堆在枷上，臉和頸子箍的緊緊的，只剩得兩個眼睛，在縣前示眾。天氣又熱，枷到第二日，牛肉生蛆，第三日，嗚呼死了。,"The next morning in court the first culprit called was a hen thief.「You wretch!」 said Magistrate Tang. 「You have been found guilty several times, yet you are a hardened offender, not afraid of being beaten. What shall I do with you today?」 With vermilion ink he wrote on the man's face, 「Hen Stealer.」 Then he pilloried him, tied a hen back to front on his head, and threw him out. The man had just got outside the yamen gate when the hen's droppings fell onto his forehead and dripped down over his nose and moustache onto the pillory, sending all who saw it into fits of laughter.The next to be called was the old Moslem. Magistrate Tang stormed at him for his wicked presumption, and gave him thirty strokes. After that he put him in a large pillory, packing the fifty catties of beef so tightly around the man's neck and face that only his eyes could be seen. He was pilloried in front of the court as a public example.The weather was hot. By the next day the meat was crawling with maggots, and the day after that the old man died."
眾回子心裏不伏，一時聚眾數百人，鳴鑼罷市，鬧到縣前來，說道：「我們就是不該送牛肉來，也不該有死罪！這都是南海縣的光棍張師陸的主意！我們鬧進衙門去，揪他出來，一頓打死，派出一個人來償命！」只因這一鬧，有分教：貢生興訟，潛蹤來到省城；鄉紳結親，謁貴竟游京國。未知眾回子吵鬧何如，且聽下回分解。,"Several hundred Moslems were up in arms immediately. Sounding gongs and stopping the market, they went clamouring to the yamen to protest.「Even if it was wrong to send the beef, he shouldn't have received a death penalty!」 they cried. 「This is all the fault of that scoundrel Zhang from Nanhai County. Let's break into the yamen, drag him out and beat him to death! One of us will be willing to pay for it with his own life.」But to know to what lengths the Moslems went, you must read the next chapter."
