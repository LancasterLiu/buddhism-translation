人生南北多歧路，將相神仙，也要凡人做。百代興亡朝復暮，江風吹倒前朝樹。功名富貴無憑據，費盡心情，總把流光誤。濁酒三杯沉醉去，水流花謝知何處。,"Men in their lives go on different ways;Generals, statesmen, saints and even immortalsBegin as ordinary people. Dynasties rise and fall,Mornings change to evenings; winds from the riverBring down old trees. From a former reign;And fame, riches, rank may vanish without a trace.Then aspire not for these, wasting your days;But drink and be merry, for who knowsWhere the waters carry the blossom cast over them?"
這一首詞，也是個老生常談。不過說人生富貴功名，是身外之物；但世人一見了功名，便捨著性命去求他，及至到手之後，味同嚼蠟。自古及今，那一個是看得破的！,"The idea expressed in this poem is the commonplace one that in human life riches, rank, success and fame are external things. Men will risk their lives in the search for them; yet once they have them within their grasp, the taste is no better than chewed tallow. But from ancient times till now, how many have accepted this?"
雖然如此說，元朝末年，也曾出了一個嶔崎磊落的人。這人姓王名冕，在諸暨縣鄉村裏住。七歲上死了父親，他母親做些針黹，供給他到村學堂裏去讀書。看看三個年頭，王冕已是十歲了。母親喚他到面前來說道：「兒啊，不是我有心要耽誤你。只因你父親亡後，我一個寡婦人家，只有出去的，沒有進來的；年歲不好，柴米又貴；這幾件舊衣服和些舊傢伙，當的當了，賣的賣了；只靠著我替人家做些針黹生活尋來的錢，如何供得你讀書。如今沒奈何，把你僱在間壁人家放牛，每月可以得他幾錢銀子，你又有現成飯喫，只在明日就要去了。」王冕道：「娘說的是。我在學堂裏坐著，心裏也悶；不如往他家放牛，倒快活些。假如我要讀書，依舊可以帶幾本去讀。」當夜商議定了。,"However, at the end of the Yuan Dynasty a really remarkable man was born. His name was Wang Mian, and he lived in a village in Zhuji County in Zhejiang. When he was seven his father died, but his mother took in sewing so that he could study at the village school. Soon three years had passed and Wang Mian was ten. His mother called him to her and said, 「Son, it's not that I want to stand in your way. But since your father died and left me a widow, I have had nothing coming in. Times are hard, and fuel and rice are expensive. Our old clothes and our few sticks of furniture have been pawned or sold. We have nothing to live on but what I make by my sewing. How can I pay for your schooling? There's nothing for it but to set you to work looking after our neighbour's buffalo. You'll be making a little money every month, and you'll get your meals there too. You start tomorrow.」「Yes, mother,」 said Wang Mian. 「I find sitting in school boring anyway. I'd rather look after buffaloes. If I want to study, I can take a few books along to read.」 So that very night the matter was decided."
第二日，母親同他到間壁秦老家。秦老留著他母子兩個喫了早飯，牽出一條水牛來交與王冕，指著門外道：「就在我這大門過去兩箭之地，便是七泖湖，湖邊一帶綠草，各家的牛都在那裏打睡。又有幾十夥合抱的垂楊樹，十分陰涼。牛要渴了，就在湖邊上飲水。小哥，你只在這一帶頑耍，不必遠去。我老漢每日兩餐小菜飯是不少的，每日早上，還折兩個錢與你買點心喫。只是百事勤謹些，休嫌怠慢。」他母親謝了擾要回家去，王冕送出門來。母親替他理理衣服，口裏說道：「你在此須要小心，休惹人說不是；早出晚歸，免我懸望。」王冕應諾，母親含著兩眼眼淚去了。,"The next morning his mother took him to the Qin family next door. Old Qin gave them some breakfast, and when they had finished he led out a water buffalo and made it over to Wang Mian.「Two bow shots from my gate is the lake,」 he said, pointing outside. 「And by the lake is a belt of green where all the buffaloes of the village browse. There are a few dozen big willows there too, so that it is quiet, shady and cool; and if the buffalo is thirsty it can drink at the water's edge. You can play there, son; but don't wander off. I shall see that you get rice and vegetables twice a day; and each morning I shall give you a few coppers to buy a snack to eat while you're out. Only you must work well. I hope you'll find this satisfactory.」Wang Mian's mother thanked Old Qin and turned to go home. Her son saw her to the gate, and there she straightened his clothes for him.「Mind now, don't give them any reason to find fault with you,」 she charged him. 「Go out early and come back at dusk. I don't want to have to worry about you.」Wang Mian nodded assent. Then, with tears in her eyes, she left him."
王冕自此只在秦家放牛，每到黃昏，回家跟著母親歇宿。或遇秦家煮些醃魚、臘肉給他喫，他便拿塊荷葉包了來家，遞與母親。每日點心錢，他也不買了喫，聚到一兩個月，便偷個空，走到村學堂裏，見那闖學堂的書客，就買幾本舊書，日逐把牛栓了，坐在柳蔭樹下看。,"From this time onwards, Wang Mian looked after Old Qin's buffalo; and every evening he went home to sleep. Whenever the Qin family gave him salted fish or meat, he would wrap it up in a lotus leaf and take it to his mother. He also saved the coppers he was given each day to buy a snack with, and every month or so would seize an opportunity to go to the village school to buy some old books from the book-vendor making his rounds. Every day, when he had tethered the buffalo, he would sit down beneath the willows and read."
彈指又過了三四年。王冕看書，心下也著實明白了。那日，正是黃梅時候，天氣煩躁。王冕放牛倦了，在綠草地上坐著。須臾，濃雲密布，一陣大雨過了。那黑雲邊上鑲著白雲，漸漸散去，透出一派日光來，照耀得滿湖通紅。湖邊上山，青一塊，紫一塊，綠一塊。樹枝上都像水洗過一番的，尤其綠得可愛。湖裏有十來枝荷花，苞子上清水滴滴，荷葉上水珠滾來滾去。王冕看了一回，心裏想道：「古人說：『人在畫圖中』，其實不錯。可惜我這裏沒有一個畫工，把這荷花畫他幾枝，也覺有趣。」又心裏想道：「天下那有個學不會的事，我何不自畫他幾枝。」,"So three or four years quickly passed. Wang Mian studied and began to see things clearly. One sultry day in early summer, tired after leading the buffalo to graze, he sat down on the grass. Suddenly dense clouds gathered, and there was a heavy shower of rain. Then the black storm clouds fringed with fleecy white drifted apart, and the sun shone through, bathing the whole lake in crimson light. The hills by the lake were blue, violet and emerald. The trees, freshly washed by the rain, were a lovelier green than ever. Crystal drops were dripping from a dozen lotus buds in the lake, while beads of water rolled about the leaves.As Wang Mian watched, he thought, 「The ancients said, 'In a beautiful scene a man feels he is part of a picture.' How true! What a pity there is no painter here to paint these sprays of lotus. That would be good.」 Then he reflected, 「There's nothing a man can't learn. Why shouldn't I paint them myself?」"
正存想間，只見遠遠的一個夯漢，挑了一擔食盒來，手裏提著一瓶酒，食盒上掛著一塊氈條，來到柳樹下，將氈鋪了，食盒打開。那邊走過三個人來，頭帶方巾，一個穿寶藍夾紗直裰，兩人穿元色直裰，都有四五十歲光景，手搖白紙扇，緩步而來。那穿寶藍直裰的是個胖子，來到樹下，尊那穿元色的一個鬍子坐在上面，那一個瘦子坐在對席；他想是主人了，坐在下面把酒來斟。,"Just then, he saw in the distance a fellow carrying two hampers over his shoulder and a bottle of wine in his hand. Hanging from one hamper was a rug. The man spread the rug under the willows, and opened the hampers. Behind him came three men in scholars' square caps, all some forty to fifty years old. Two were dressed in dark grey, and the third in a blue linen gown. Fanning themselves with white paper fans, they advanced slowly. The one in blue was fat. When he reached the willows he asked one of the men in grey, one with a long beard, to take the seat of honour, and another, a thin one, to sit on the rug opposite. He himself was evidently the host, for he sat in the lowest place and poured the wine. They began eating."
喫了一回，那胖子開口道：「危老先生回來了。新買了住宅，比京裏鐘樓街的房子還大些，值得二千兩銀子。因老先生要買，房主人讓了幾十兩銀賣了，圖個名望體面。前月初十搬家，太尊、縣父母都親自到門來賀，留著喫酒到二三更天。街上的人，那一個不敬。」那瘦子道：「縣尊是壬午舉人，乃危老先生門生，這是該來賀的。」那胖子道：「敝親家也是危老先生門生，而今在河南做知縣。前日小婿來家，帶二斤乾鹿肉來見惠，這一盤就是了。這一回小婿再去，託敝親家寫一封字來，去晉謁晉謁危老先生；他若肯下鄉回拜，也免得這些鄉戶人家，放了驢和豬在你我田裏喫糧食。」那瘦子道：「危老先生要算一個學者了。」那鬍子說道：「聽見前日出京時，皇上親自送出城外，攜著手走了十幾步，危老先生再三打躬辭了，方纔上轎回去。看這光景，莫不是就要做官？」三人你一句，我一句，說個不了。,"After a while, the fat man said, 「Mr. Wei has come back. His new house is even bigger than the one in Bell Tower Street in the capital. The price was two thousand taels of silver, but, because the purchaser was so distinguished, the owner allowed him several dozen taels discount for the sake of the credit he would get from this transaction. On the tenth of last month Mr. Wei moved in. The prefect and the county magistrate called to congratulate him, and stayed there feasting until nearly midnight. There is nobody who does not respect him.」「The magistrate used to be Mr. Wei's pupil,」 said the thin man. 「It was only right for him to pay his respects.」「My son-in-law's father is an old pupil of Mr. Wei's, too,」 said the fat man. 「He has a post as magistrate now in Henan Province. The day before yesterday my son-in-law came to visit me, bringing two catties of dried venison—that's it on this dish. When he goes back, he's going to ask his father to write a letter of introduction so that I can call on Mr. Wei. Then, if Mr. Wei condescends to come to the village to return the visit, the villagers won't dare to turn their donkeys and pigs loose to eat the grain in our fields any more.」「Mr. Wei is a real scholar,」 said the thin man.「Recently, when he left the capital,」 said the man with the beard, 「I heard the emperor himself escorted him out of the city, taking his hand and walking nearly twenty steps with him. It was only after Mr. Wei had repeatedly bowed and entreated him to go no further that the emperor got into his sedan-chair and returned to the city. Judging by this, Mr. Wei will probably soon become a great official.」The three men talked on and on."
王冕見天色晚了，牽了牛回去。自此，聚的錢不買書了，託人向城裏買些胭脂鉛粉之類，學畫荷花。初時畫得不好，畫到三個月之後，那荷花，精神、顏色無一不像，只多著一張紙，就像是湖裏長的；又像纔從湖裏摘下來，貼在紙上的。鄉間人見畫得好，也有拿錢來買的。王冕得了錢，買些好東好西，孝敬母親。一傳兩，兩傳三，諸暨一縣都曉得是一個畫沒骨花卉的名筆，爭著來買。到了十七八歲，不在秦家了，每日畫幾筆畫，讀古人的詩文，漸漸不愁衣食，母親心裏歡喜。,"Wang Mian saw that it was growing late, and led the buffalo back. After that, Wang Mian no longer spent his savings on books, but asked someone to buy paints for him in the city, and learnt to paint lotus flowers. At first he did not do too well, but after three months he succeeded in capturing the very essence and shades of colour of the lotus. Though he painted on paper, his flowers seemed to be growing in the water, or as if freshly plucked from the lake and placed on a scroll. When the villagers saw how well he painted, some even bought his pictures. And when Wang Mian had money he bought good things for his mother. One person told another, until the whole of Zhuji County knew that he was a famous flower painter, and people vied with each other in their eagerness to buy. By the time he was eighteen he had stopped working for Old Qin, and spent every day doing some painting or reading old poems and essays. By degrees he no longer had to worry about his livelihood, and his mother was happy."
這王冕天性聰明，年紀不滿二十歲，就把那天文、地理，經史上的大學問，無一不貫通。但他性情不同：既不求官爵，又不交納朋友，終日閉戶讀書。又在楚辭圖上看見畫的屈原衣冠，他便自造一頂極高的帽子，一件極闊的衣服。遇著花明柳媚的時節，把一乘牛車載了母親，他便戴了高帽，穿了闊衣，執著鞭子，口裏唱著歌曲，在鄉村鎮上，以及湖邊，到處頑耍，惹的鄉下孩子們三五成群跟著他笑，他也不放在意下。只有隔壁秦老，雖然務農，卻是個有意思的人；因自小看見他長大，如此不俗，所以敬他，愛他，時時和他親熱，邀在草堂裏坐著說話兒。,"Wang Mian had genius. While still in his teens, he mastered the whole field of astronomy, geography, the classics and history. He was, however, eccentric. He did not look for an official post, and did not even have any friends. All day he studied behind closed doors; and when he saw in an edition of the poems of Chu Yuan a picture of the poet's costume, he made himself a very high hat and a loose flowing gown. In the fresh and flowering spring he would take his mother out in a buffalo cart, and, dressed in his high hat and loose gown, flourishing the whip and singing songs, would drive all over the countryside and around the lake. Small groups of village children would tag after him, laughing; but he did not mind them. Only his neighbour, Old Qin, realized how remarkable he was; for Old Qin was an intelligent man, though a peasant, and he had seen Wang Mian grow up. He respected and loved Wang Mian, and often asked him to his thatched cottage to talk with him."
一日，正和秦老坐著，只見外邊走進一個人來，頭帶瓦楞帽，身穿青布衣服。秦老迎接，敘禮坐下。這人姓翟，是諸暨縣一個頭役，又是買辦。因秦老的兒子秦大漢拜在他名下，叫他乾爺，所以常時下鄉來看親家。秦老慌忙叫兒子烹茶，殺雞、煮肉款留他；就要王冕相陪。彼此道過姓名。那翟買辦道：「只位王相公，可就是會畫沒骨花的麼？」秦老道：「便是了。親家，你怎得知道？」翟買辦道：「縣裏人那個不曉得。因前日本縣老爺吩咐：要畫二十四副花卉冊頁送上司，此事交在我身上。我聞有王相公的大名，故此一徑來尋親家。今日有緣，遇著王相公，是必費心大筆畫一畫。在下半個月後，下鄉來取。老爺少不得還有幾兩潤筆的銀子，一併送來。」秦老在傍，著實攛掇。王冕屈不過秦老的情，只得應諾了。回家用心用意，畫了二十四副花卉，都題了詩在上面。翟頭役稟過了本官，那知縣時仁，發出二十四兩銀子來。翟買辦扣剋了十二兩，只拿十二兩銀子送與王冕，將冊頁取去。時知縣又辦了幾樣禮物，送與危素，作候問之禮。,"One day Wang Mian was sitting in Old Qin's cottage when a man wearing a bailiff's cap and blue cloth gown came in. Old Qin welcomed him, and after an exchange of courtesies they sat down. This newcomer's name was Zhai. He was a county runner and also a bailiff, but since Old Qin's son was his godchild he often came to the village to visit their family. Old Qin hastily called his son to make tea, kill a chicken and cook some meat to entertain the bailiff, and asked Wang Mian to accompany them.When Bailiff Zhai heard Wang Mian's name, he asked, 「Is this Mr. Wang the flower painter?」「Yes,」 said Old Qin. 「How did you get to know of him?」「Is there anyone in the county who doesn't know him?」 retorted the bailiff. 「The other day the county magistrate commissioned me to get twenty-four paintings of flowers to send to a superior. Knowing Mr. Wang's great reputation, I've come straight here; and now I'm lucky enough to meet Mr. Wang himself.」 Then he turned to Wang Mian and said: 「I must trouble you to do some paintings. In two weeks I shall come to fetch them, bringing the payment from Magistrate Shi.」Old Qin pressed Wang Mian to consent and, to please the old man, he agreed.He went home and took infinite pains to paint twenty-four pictures of flowers, each with a poem appended. Bailiff Zhai reported his meeting with Wang Mian to the magistrate, who gave him twenty-four taels of silver. Of this sum Zhai appropriated half, giving twelve taels only to Wang Mian. He took the flower album away with him, and then the magistrate sent it with some other presents to Mr. Wei."
危素受了禮物，只把這本冊頁看了又看，愛玩不忍釋手。次日，備了一席酒，請時知縣來家致謝。當下寒暄已畢，酒過數巡，危素道：「前日承老父臺所惠冊頁花卉，還是古人的呢，還是現在人畫的？」時知縣不敢隱瞞，便道：「這就是門生治下一個鄉下農民，叫做王冕，年紀也不甚大。想是纔學畫幾筆，難入老師的法眼。」,"When Mr. Wei accepted the gifts, the album alone attracted his attention. He looked at the paintings again and again, liking them so much that he could scarcely take his eyes off them. The next day he invited Magistrate Shi to a feast to thank him. They exchanged greetings, and drank several cups of wine.「Yesterday I received your gift of a flower album,」 said Mr. Wei. 「Is it the work of an old master or of a contemporary?」Not daring to conceal the truth, the magistrate told him, 「It was painted by a peasant in one of the villages in my county. His name is Wang Mian, and he is quite young. I believe he has just learnt to paint; but his work is unworthy of your distinguished notice.」"
危素歎道：「我學生出門久了，故鄉有如此賢士，竟坐不知，可為慚愧。此兄不但才高，胸中見識，大是不同，將來名位不在你我之下。不知老父臺可以約他來此相會一會麼？」時知縣道：「這個何難，門生出去，即遣人相約。他聽見老師相愛，自然喜出望外了。」說罷，辭了危素，回到衙門，差翟買辦持個侍生帖子去約王冕。,"Mr. Wei sighed and said, 「I left home so long ago that, though my native place has produced so great a man, I did not know it. I am ashamed. He shows not only remarkable skill but exceptional insight, and in future his fame and rank will at least equal ours. I wonder if you would invite him to pay me a visit?」「What could be simpler?」 replied Magistrate Shi. 「When I leave I shall send a man to invite him. He will be only too pleased to come.」When Magistrate Shi had taken his leave of Mr. Wei, he returned to his yamen and ordered Bailiff Zhai to take an invitation card couched in most respectful terms to Wang Mian."
翟買辦飛奔下鄉，到秦老家，邀王冕過來，一五一十，向他說了。王冕笑道：「卻是起動頭翁，上覆縣主老爺，說王冕乃一介農夫，不敢求見。這尊帖也不敢領。」翟買辦變了臉道：「老爺將帖請人，誰敢不去！況這件事，原是我照顧你的；不然，老爺如何得知你會畫花？論理，見過老爺，還該重重的謝我一謝纔是！如何走到這裏，茶也不見你一杯，卻是推三阻四，不肯去見，是何道理？叫我如何去回覆得老爺！難道老爺一縣之主，叫不動一個百姓麼？」,"Zhai hurried down to the village to Old Qin's house, and sent for Wang Mian to step over. Then he told him what his business was.Wang Mian smiled and said, 「I must trouble you to inform the magistrate that Wang Mian is only a peasant and dare not accept such an invitation.」The bailiff's face fell. 「When the magistrate invites, who dare refuse?」 he demanded. 「Especially as it was I who did you this favour! If I hadn't recommended you, how would His Honour know you could paint? You ought by rights to be rewarding me! Instead, after coming all this way, I don't see so much as a cup of tea, and you fob me off with excuses. And why won't you go, pray? Do you mean to say a county magistrate can't summon a common man? What am I to say to the magistrate when I get back?」"
王冕道：「頭翁，你有所不知。假如我為了事，老爺拿票子傳我，我怎敢不去！如今將帖來請，原是不逼迫我的意思了；我不願去，老爺也可以相諒。」翟買辦道：「你這都說的是甚麼話！票子傳著倒要去，帖子請著倒不去？這不是不識抬舉了！」,"「It's not that, sir,」 said Wang Mian. 「If I receive a summons from the magistrate, how dare I refuse? But you have brought an invitation, which means I am under no compulsion. I don't want to go. His Honour must excuse me.」「That doesn't make sense!」 exclaimed the bailiff. 「Served with a summons, you go. Asked by invitation, you don't. You simply don't know what's good for you!」"
秦老勸道：「王相公，也罷；老爺拿帖子請你，自然是好意，你同親家去走一回罷。自古道：『滅門的知縣』，你和他拗些甚麼？」王冕道：「秦老爹！頭翁不知，你是聽見我說過的。不見那段干木、泄柳的故事麼？我是不願去的。」,"「Mr. Wang,」 put in Old Qin, 「if the magistrate sends an invitation, he must mean well. So why not go? The proverb says, 'Magistrates can ruin families.' Why ask for trouble?'「The bailiff doesn't understand, uncle,」 said Wang Mian, 「but haven't you heard me tell the stories of the two ancient sages who refused to see their rulers? No, I'm not going.」"
翟買辦道：「你這是難題目與我做，叫我拿甚麼話去回老爺？」秦老道：「這個果然也是兩難。若要去時，王相公又不肯；若要不去，親家又難回話。我如今倒有一法：親家回縣裏，不要說王相公不肯，只說他抱病在家，不能就來，一兩日間好了就到。」翟買辦道：「害病，就要取四鄰的甘結！」,"「You are making it very difficult for me,」 said the bailiff. 「What can I say to the magistrate when I go back?」「In fact, it is difficult for you both,」 said Old Qin. 「Mr. Wang doesn't want to go. But if he doesn't go, that'll be very embarrassing for Bailiff Zhai. Now I have a plan. When you go back to the yamen, bailiff, don't say that Mr. Wang refuses the invitation, but just that he is ill and can't go. He will go in a few days when he is better.」「If he were ill,」 objected the bailiff, 「I should have to get a signed statement to that effect from the neighbours.」"
彼此爭論了一番，秦老整治晚飯與他喫了；又暗叫了王冕出去問母親秤了三錢二分銀子，送與翟買辦做差錢，方纔應諾去了，回覆知縣。,"They argued for some time. Then Old Qin prepared supper for the bailiff, and while he was eating told Wang Mian secretly to ask his mother for a little silver as messenger's fee. Only then did Zhai consent to go back."
知縣心裏想道：「這小廝那裏害甚麼病！想是翟家這奴才，走下鄉狐假虎威，著實恐嚇了他一場。他從來不曾見過官府的人，害怕不敢來了。老師既把這個人託我，我若不把他就叫了來見老師，也惹得老師笑我做事疲軟。我不如竟自己下鄉去拜他。他看見賞他臉面，斷不是難為他的意思，自然大著膽見我；我就便帶了他來見老師，卻不是辦事勤敏？」,"When Magistrate Shi heard the bailiff's report, he thought, 「How can the fellow be ill? It's all the fault of this rascal Zhai. He goes down to the villages like a donkey in a lion's hide, and he must have scared this painter fellow out of his wits. Wang Mian has never seen an official before in his life. He's afraid to come. But my patron charged me personally to get this man, and if I fail to produce him, Mr. Wei will think me incompetent. I had better go to the village myself to call on him. When he sees what an honour I'm doing him, he'll realize nobody wants to make trouble for him and won't be afraid to see me. Then I'll take him to call on my patron, and my patron will appreciate the smart way I've handled it.」"
又想道：「一個堂堂縣令，屈尊去拜一個鄉民，惹得衙役們笑話。」又想到：「老師前日口氣，甚是敬他；老師敬他十分，我就該敬他一百分。況且屈尊敬賢，將來志書上少不得稱贊一篇。這是萬古千年不朽的勾當，有甚麼做不得！」當下定了主意。,"Then, however, it occurred to him that his subordinates might laugh at the idea of a county magistrate calling on a mere peasant. Yet Mr. Wei had spoken of Wang Mian with the greatest respect. 「If Mr. Wei respects him, I should respect him ten times as much,」 Magistrate Shi reflected. 「And if I stoop in order to show respect to talent, future compilers of the local chronicles will certainly devote a chapter to my praise. Then my name will be remembered for hundreds of years. Why shouldn't I do it?」 So he decided to go."
次早，傳齊轎夫，也不用全副執事，只帶八個紅黑帽夜役軍牢。翟買辦扶著轎子，一直下鄉來。鄉裏人聽見鑼響，一個個扶老攜幼，挨擠了看。轎子來到王冕門首，只見七八間草屋，一扇白板門緊緊關著。翟買辦搶上幾步，忙去敲門。敲了一會，裏面一個婆婆，拄著拐杖，出來說道：「不在家了。從清早晨牽牛出去飲水，尚未回來。」翟買辦道：「老爺親自在這裏傳你家兒子說話，怎的慢條斯理！快快說在那裏，我好去傳！」那婆婆道：「其實不在家了，不知在那裏。」說畢，關著門進去了。,"The next morning the magistrate called for his chairbearers. Taking only eight runners in red and black caps, and with Bailiff Zhai in attendance, he went straight down to the village. When the villagers heard the gongs, young and old flocked round to see the chair. Then the procession reached a cluster of huts. Wang Mian's door, of unvarnished wood, was firmly fastened. Bailiff Zhai hurried forward to knock at the door, and after some time an old woman came out, leaning on a stick.「He is not at home,」 she said in reply to Zhai's inquiry. 「Early this morning he took the buffalo out to water it, and he has not come back.」「The magistrate himself is here to speak with your son,」 said the bailiff. 「How can you be so offhand? Tell me quickly where he is, so that I can fetch him back.」「He is really not at home,」 answered the old woman. 「I don't know where he is.」 This said, she went in, closing the door behind her."
說話之間，知縣轎子已到。翟買辦跪在轎前稟道：「小的傳王冕，不在家裏，請老爺龍駕到公館裏略坐一坐，小的再去傳。」扶著轎子，過王冕屋後來。屋後橫七豎八，幾稜窄田埂，遠遠的一面大塘，塘邊都栽滿了榆樹、桑樹。塘邊那一望無際的幾頃田地，又有一座山，雖不甚大，卻青蔥樹木，堆滿山上。約有一里多路，彼此叫呼，還聽得見。知縣正走著，遠遠的有個牧童，倒騎水牯牛，從山嘴邊轉了過來。,"During this conversation the magistrate's chair had come up. Bailiff Zhai knelt before the chair and said, 「I asked for Wang Mian and found he is not at home. Won't Your Honour go to the local office to rest for a little, while I make further inquiries?」 Then he escorted the chair past the back of Wang Mian's cottage.Behind the cottage were a few strips of arable land and a big lake, its banks thickly grown with elms and mulberry trees. Then more fields could be seen, stretching to the horizon. There was a hill too, covered with fresh green trees, only a few hundred yards away. If you shouted, your voice would carry there. And round the foot of this hill, as the magistrate's chair advanced, came a little cowherd riding back to front on a water buffalo."
翟買辦趕將上去，問道：「秦小二漢，你看見你隔壁的王老大牽了牛在那裏飲水哩？」小二道：「王大叔麼？他在二十里路外王家集親家家喫酒去了。這牛就是他的，央及我替他趕了來家。」翟買辦如此這般稟了知縣。知縣變著臉道：「既然如此，不必進公館了！即回衙門去罷！」時知縣此時心中十分惱怒，本要立即差人拿了王冕來責懲一番；又想恐怕危老師說他暴躁，且忍口氣回去，慢慢向老師說明此人不中抬舉，再處置他也不遲。知縣去了。,"Hurrying over, Bailiff Zhai called, 「Little Qin! Did you see where Old Wang from next door went to water his buffalo?」 The small boy replied, 「Uncle Wang has gone to Wang Market, seven miles away. He went to a feast with a relative there. This is his buffalo that I'm bringing home for him.」 When Magistrate Shi heard this, he flushed angrily and said, 「In that case, I need not go to the local office. Let us go back to the yamen.」 Thoroughly annoyed, his first impulse was to tell his attendants to arrest Wang Mian and punish him. Afraid, however, that Mr. Wei would call him hotheaded, he decided to swallow his anger and go back to explain to his patron that Wang Mian did not deserve to be honoured. He could punish the fellow later. Having reached this decision, he left."
冕並不曾遠行，即時走了來家。秦老過來抱怨他道：「你方纔也太執意了。他是一縣之主，你怎的這樣怠慢他？」王冕道：「老爹請坐，我告訴你。時知縣倚著危素的勢，要在這裏酷虐小民，無所不為。這樣的人，我為甚麼要相與他？但他這一番回去，必定向危素說；危素老羞變怒，恐要和我計較起來。我如今辭別老爹，收拾行李，到別處去躲避幾時。只是母親在家，放心不下。」,"Wang Mian had not really gone far. He came back presently and was reproached by Old Qin, who said, 「You are too obstinate. He is the head of a county; how can you show such disrespect?」「Please sit down, uncle,」 said Wang Mian, 「and I will explain. This magistrate relies on Mr. Wei's authority to tyrannize over the common people here, and do all kinds of bad things. Why should I have anything to do with such a man? But now that he has gone back, he will certainly tell Mr. Wei; and if Mr. Wei becomes angry he may want to make trouble for me. So now I shall pack up my things, leave my mother, and go into hiding for a time. The only thing that worries me is leaving my mother here by herself.」"
母親道：「我兒，你歷年賣詩賣畫，我也積聚下三五十兩銀子，柴米不愁沒有。我雖年老，又無疾病，你自放心出去躲避些時不妨。你又不曾犯罪，難道官府來拿你的母親去不成？」秦老道：「這也說得有理。況你埋沒在這鄉村鎮上，雖有才學，誰人是識得你的；此番到大邦去處，或者走出些遇合來也不可知，你尊堂家下大小事故，一切都在我老漢身上，替你扶持便了。」王冕拜謝了秦老。秦老又走回家去，取了些酒肴來替王冕送行，喫了半夜酒回去。,"His mother said, 「Son, all these years, thanks to the poems and paintings you have sold, I have saved nearly fifty taels of silver. I don't have to worry about fuel and rice; and, old as I am, I'm hale and hearty. There's no reason why you shouldn't leave home and lie low for a time. You haven't committed any crime. The officers can't arrest your mother.」「She's right,」 agreed Old Qin. 「Besides, if you bury yourself in this village, who will recognize your talents? Go to some big place, and who knows but what you may meet with recognition. I'll keep an eye on everything here for you, and see that your mother is all right.」Wang Mian bowed his thanks to Old Qin, who went home to fetch food and wine for his friend. They feasted late into the night."
次日五更，王冕起來收拾行李，喫了早飯，恰好秦老也到。王冕拜辭了母親，又拜了秦老兩拜，母子灑淚分手。王冕穿上麻鞋，背上行李。秦老手提一個小白燈籠，直送出村口，灑淚而別。秦老手拿燈籠，站著看著他走，走的望不著了，方纔回去。,"The next day Wang Mian got up before dawn, packed his belongings, and had breakfast; and then Old Qin arrived. Wang Mian bowed to his mother and to Old Qin; then, in tears, son and mother bade each other farewell. Wang Mian was wearing hempen sandals and carrying his possessions on his back. Old Qin, holding a small white lantern in his hand, saw him to the end of the village and, shedding tears, bade him goodbye. Then he stood, lantern in hand, gazing after Wang Mian until he could see him no more."
王冕一路風餐露宿，九十里大站，七十里小站，一徑來到山東濟南府地方。這山東雖是近北省分，這會城卻也人物富庶，房舍稠密。王冕到了此處，盤費用盡了，只得租個小菴門面屋，賣卜測字，也畫兩張沒骨的花卉貼在那裏，賣與過往的人。每日問卜賣畫，倒也擠個不開。彈指間，過了半年光景。,"Braving the wind and dew, Wang Mian travelled day after day past large posting stations and small, till he came to the city of Jinan. Although Shandong is a northern province, its chief city was rich and populous, packed with buildings. By the time Wang Mian arrived here, his money was spent, and he had to rent a small front room in a temple and tell fortunes there. He also painted pictures of flowers, and posted up a couple to sell to passers-by. Every day he told fortunes and sold paintings, and customers flocked to him. In this way six months flew by."
濟南府裏有幾個俗財主，也愛王冕的畫，時常要買；又自己不來，遣幾個粗夯小廝，動不動大呼小叫，鬧的王冕不得安穩。王冕心不耐煩，就畫了一條大牛貼在那裏；又題幾句詩在上，含著譏刺。也怕從此有口舌，正思量搬移一個地方。,"Now there were some rich men in Jinan who took a fancy to Wang Mian's paintings and became regular customers. They did not come to buy themselves, but would send rough servants who shouted and wrangled and gave Wang Mian no peace. Finally, in exasperation, he painted a picture of a big ox and pasted it up in his shop, appending some satirical verses. After that he knew he could expect trouble, and planned to move to another town."
那日清早，纔坐在那裏，只見許多男女，啼啼哭哭，在街上過。也有挑著鍋的，也有籮擔內挑著孩子的，一個個面黃肌瘦，衣裳襤褸。過去一陣，又是一陣，把街上都塞滿了。也有坐在地上就化錢的。問其所以，都是黃河沿上的州縣，被河水決了。田廬房舍，盡行漂沒。這是些逃荒的百姓，官府又不管，只得四散覓食。,"One morning, as he was sitting in his room, his attention was attracted by a number of men and women, many of them in tears, passing down the street. Some were carrying pans, others had children in baskets suspended from a pole over their shoulders. Group after group passed, haggard, half-starved, their clothes in rags. They filled the streets, and some of them sat on the ground to beg. When Wang Mian asked where they were from, he found that they came from the villages by the Yellow River. Their fields and homes had been flooded, so now they were refugees; and since the government would do nothing for them, they were reduced to beggary."
王冕見此光景，過意不去，歎了一口氣道：「河水北流，天下自此將大亂了。我還在這裏做甚麼！」將些散碎銀子，收拾好了，栓束行李，仍舊回家。入了浙江境，纔打聽得危素已還朝了，時知縣也陞任去了；因此放心回家，拜見母親。看見母親康健如常，心中歡喜。母親又向他說秦老許多好處。他慌忙打開行李，取出一匹繭紬，一包耿餅，拿過去拜謝了秦老。秦老又備酒與他洗塵。自此，王冕依舊吟詩作畫，奉養母親。,"Distressed by this sight, Wang Mian sighed and said, 「Now the river has left its course again. This has invariably been a prelude to a period of great confusion. Why should I stay here?」 Putting together his money and belongings, he started for home. When he reached Zhejiang Province, he heard that Mr. Wei had gone back to the capital and Magistrate Shi had been promoted to another post. He could, therefore, feel easy in his mind about going home.He bowed before his mother, and was happy to see that she was as healthy as ever. She told him that Old Qin had been very good to her, whereupon Wang Mian hastily unpacked a whole bolt of silk and a package of dried persimmons which he gave to Old Qin to express his thanks. And Old Qin prepared a feast for his home-coming. After that Wang Mian lived as before, chanting poetry, painting pictures and taking care of his mother like a good son."
又過了六年，母親老病臥床。王冕百方延醫調治，總不見效。一日，母親吩咐王冕道：「我眼見得不濟事了。但這幾年來，人都在我耳根前說你的學問有了，該勸你出去作官，作官怕不是榮宗耀祖的事！我看見那些作官的都不得有甚好收場！況你的性情高傲，倘若弄出禍來，反為不美。我兒可聽我的遺言，將來娶妻生子，守著我的墳墓，不要出去作官。我死了，口眼也閉！」王冕哭著應諾。他母親淹淹一息，歸天去了。王冕擗踴哀號，哭得那鄰舍之人，無不落淚。又虧秦老一力幫襯，制備衣衾棺槨。王冕負土成墳，三年苫塊，不必細說。,"Six years later, his mother, weak from old age, took to her bed. Every means was tried to cure her, but in vain. One day she called him to her and said, 「I am near the end. The last few years everybody has been telling me that as you are so learned, I should advise you to go out and become an official. Of course, being an official would reflect credit on your forefathers. But the officials I have seen have all come to a bad end. And you are so proud that if you got into trouble it would be serious. Listen, son, to my dying wish: Marry, have children and care for my grave; but don't become an official. Promise me this and I shall die in peace.」In tears, Wang Mian assented. Then his mother breathed her last. Wang Mian mourned and wept so bitterly that all the neighbours shed tears. Old Qin helped him prepare the burial clothes and coffin, while he himself carried earth to make the grave. For three years he mourned."
到了服闋之後，不過一年有餘，天下就大亂了。方國珍據了浙江，張士誠據了蘇州，陳友諒據了湖廣，都是些草竊的英雄。只有太祖皇帝起兵滁陽，得了金陵，立為吳王，乃是王者之師；提兵破了方國珍，號令全浙，鄉村鎮市，並無騷擾。,"A year after the period of mourning was over, the whole empire was plunged into confusion. Fang Guo-zhen occupied Zhejiang, Zhang Shi-cheng occupied Suzhou, and Chen Youliang occupied Huguang. They were mere rebels. But at the same time, Zhu Yuan-zhang, who later became the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty, raised soldiers in Chuyang, took Nanjing, and established himself as Prince of Wu. His was a kingly army. He led his troops to defeat Fang Guo-zhen, and ruled over the whole province of Zhejiang, so that villages and towns were at peace once more."
一日，日中時分，王冕正從母親墳上拜掃回來，只見十幾騎馬竟投他村裏來。為頭一人，頭戴武巾，身穿團花戰袍，白淨面皮，三綹髭鬚，真有龍鳳之表。那人到門首下了馬，向王冕施禮道：「動問一聲，那裏是王冕先生家？」王冕道：「小人王冕，這裏便是寒舍。」那人喜道：「如此甚妙，特來晉謁。」吩咐從人都下了馬，屯在外邊，把馬都繫在湖邊柳樹上。,"One day at noon, just as Wang Mian was returning from his mother's grave, he saw a dozen horsemen entering the village. The leader of the band wore a military cap and flowered silk costume. He had a clear complexion, his beard was fine, and he looked every inch a king. When this man reached Wang Mian's door, he alighted from his horse, saluted and said, 「May I ask where Mr. Wang Mian lives?」「I am he,」 replied Wang Mian, 「and this is my humble house.」「I am in luck then,」 said the stranger, 「for I have come specially to pay my respects.」 He ordered his followers to dismount and wait outside, and they tethered their horses beneath the willows by the lake."
那人獨和王冕攜手進到屋裏，分賓主施禮坐下。王冕道：「不敢拜問尊官尊姓大名？因甚降臨這鄉僻所在？」那人道：「我姓朱，先在江南起兵，號滁陽王；而今據有金陵，稱為吳王的便是。因平方國珍到此，特來拜訪先生。」王冕道：「鄉民肉眼不識，原來就是王爺。但鄉民一介愚人，怎敢勞王爺貴步？」吳王道：「孤是一個粗鹵漢子，今得見先生儒者氣像，不覺功利之見頓消。孤在江南，即慕大名，今來拜訪，要先生指示：浙人久反之後，何以能服其心？」,"The stranger took Wang Mian's hand and went into the house with him. They sat down in the positions of guest and host, and Wang Mian asked, 「May I know your honourable name and what has brought you to this village?」「My name is Zhu. I raised troops in Jiangnan and was known as the Prince of Chuyang; but now, because I hold Nanjing, I am called the Prince of Wu. The campaign against Fang Guo-zhen brought me here, and now I have come to pay my respects to you.」「I am an ignorant villager,」 said Wang Mian, 「and did not recognize Your Highness. This is indeed an overwhelming honour for a simple peasant like myself.」「I am a rough and ready fellow,」 answered the Prince of Wu, 「but at the sight of your scholarly bearing, my thirst for fame and wealth has vanished. When I was still in Jiangnan your fame reached my ears, and now I have come to consult you. The people of Zhejiang have rebelled many times. What can I do to win their love?」"
王冕道：「大王是高明遠見的，不消鄉民多說。若以仁義服人，何人不服，豈但浙江？若以兵力服人，浙人雖弱，恐亦義不受辱。不見方國珍麼？」吳王歎息，點頭稱善。兩人促膝談到日暮。那些從者都帶有乾糧。王冕自到廚下烙了一斤麵餅，炒了一盤韭菜，自捧出來，陪著。吳王喫了，稱謝教誨，上馬去了。這日，秦老進城回來，問及此事。王冕也不曾說就是吳王，只說是軍中一個將官，向年在山東相識的，故此來看我一看。說著就罷了。,"「Your Highness is far-sighted,」 said Wang Mian. 「There is no need for a humble person like myself to say much. If you use goodness and justice to win the people, you will win them all — not only those in Zhejiang. But if you try to conquer by force, weak as the people of Zhejiang are, I am afraid they will not submit. Look at the case of Fang Guo-zhen whom you defeated.」The prince nodded and expressed approval; and sitting face to face they talked till evening. The prince's followers had brought rations, and Wang Mian went to the kitchen to make bread and fry leeks for the prince, sharing the meal with him. The prince then thanked him for his advice, mounted his horse and rode away.That day Old Qin had gone to the county-seat. On his return he asked Wang Mian who his visitors had been; but instead of telling him that it was the Prince of Wu, Wang Mian simply said, 「It was an army officer I knew when I was in Shandong.」"
不數年間，吳王削平禍亂，定鼎應天，天下一統，建國號大明，年號洪武。鄉村人，各各安居樂業。到了洪武四年，秦老又進城裏，回來向王冕道：「危老爺已自問了罪，發在和州去了。我帶了一本邸抄來與你看。」,"In a few years the Prince of Wu pacified the country and established his capital at Nanjing, so that once more the empire was united. His dynasty was called Ming, and his reign Hong Wu. Once more the villagers could live at peace, enjoying the fruits of their labour. During the fourth year of the reign Old Qin went to the county-seat again, and on his return told Wang Mian, 「Mr. Wei is in disgrace and has been sentenced to exile in Hochow. I have brought a bulletin to show you.」"
王冕接過來看，纔曉得危素歸降之後，妄自尊大，在太祖面前自稱老臣。太祖大怒，發往和州守余闕墓去了。此一條之後，便是禮部議定取士之法：三年一科，用五經、四書、八股文。,"Wang Mian read it, and discovered that, since his surrender, Mr. Wei had continued to indulge in foolish display, calling himself his sovereign's old and trusted servant, until the emperor in anger had banished him to Hochow to look after the grave of Yu Que. This decree was followed by the rules of the Board of Ceremonies for the civil service examinations. Candidates would be tested every three years, and required only to write paGu essays on the Confucian classics."
王冕指與秦老看，道：「這個法卻定的不好！將來讀書人既有此一條榮身之路，把那文行出處都看得輕了。」說著，天色晚了下來。此時正是初夏，天時乍熱。秦老在打麥場上放下一張桌子，兩人小飲。須臾，東方月上，照耀得如同萬頃玻璃一般。那些眠鷗宿鷺，闃然無聲。王冕左手持杯，右手指著天上的星，向秦老道：「你看貫索犯文昌，一代文人有厄！」話猶未了，忽然起一陣怪風，刮得樹木都颼颼的響。水面上的禽鳥，格格驚起了許多。王冕同秦老嚇的將衣袖蒙了臉。少頃，風聲略定，睜眼看時，只見天上紛紛有百十個小星，都墜向東南角上去了。王冕道：「天可憐見，降下這一夥星君去維持文運，我們是不及見了！」當夜收拾家伙，各自歇息。,"Pointing this out to Old Qin, Wang Mian said, 「These rules are not good. Future candidates, knowing that there is an easy way to high position, will look down on real scholarship and correct behaviour.」 By now dusk had fallen. It was early summer and the weather was turning warm. Old Qin set a table on the threshing floor, and they drank wine. Soon the moon came up from the east, and shone so brightly that everything seemed made of glass. The water-birds had gone to their nests, and all was quiet. Holding his cup in his left hand, Wang Mian pointed to the stars with his right, and said, 「Look! The Zhains have invaded the Scholars. That shows that scholars of this generation have hard times ahead.」As he spoke, a strange wind sprang up. It soughed through the trees, and made the waterfowl take wing, crying in alarm, while Wang Mian and Old Qin hid their faces in their sleeves for fear. Soon the wind dropped, and when they looked again they saw about a hundred small stars in the sky, all falling towards the south-east horizon.「Heaven has taken pity on the scholars,」 said Wang Mian. 「These stars have been sent down to maintain the literary tradition. But we shan't live to see it.」 Then they cleared away the things and went to bed."
自此以後，時常有人傳說，朝廷行文到浙江布政司，要徵聘王冕出來做官。初時不在意裏，後來漸漸說的多了，王冕並不通知秦老，私自收拾，連夜逃往會稽山中。半年之後，朝廷果然遣一員官，捧著詔書，帶領許多人，將著綵緞表裏，來到秦老門首，見秦老八十多歲，鬚鬢皓然，手扶拄杖。那官與他施禮。秦老讓到草堂坐下。那官問道：「王冕先生就在這莊上麼？而今皇恩授他咨議參軍之職，下官特地捧詔而來。」秦老道：「他雖是這裏人，只是久矣不知去向了。」秦老獻過了茶，領那官員走到王冕家，推開了門，見蠨蛸滿室，蓬蒿滿徑，知是果然去得久了。那官咨嗟歎息了一回，仍舊捧詔回旨去了。,"Later on, many rumours were heard to the effect that the government had ordered the Zhejiang authorities to offer Wang Mian an official appointment. At first he ignored these rumours; but when more and more people began to talk of it he secretly packed his belongings and, without telling Old Qin, slipped away by night to Kuaiji Mountain. After another six months an envoy with an imperial decree, followed by retainers carrying silk and brocade, did actually come to Old Qin's door. They saw an old man of more than eighty, with a white beard and white hair, leaning on a stick. The envoy greeted him, and Old Qin invited him into his cottage to take a seat.「Does Mr. Wang Mian live in this village?」 asked the envoy. 「His Majesty has appointed him Commissioner of Records. I have brought the imperial decree.」「He belongs to this village,」 replied Old Qin, 「but he disappeared long ago.After Old Qin had served tea, he led the envoy to Wang Mian's house, and pushed open the door. The rooms were filled with cobwebs and the yard with weeds, so they knew it was true that Wang Mian had been gone for a long time. The envoy expressed regret, and went back to report to the emperor."
王冕隱居在會稽山中，並不自言姓名；後來得病去世，山鄰斂些錢財，葬於會稽山下。是年，秦老亦壽終於家。可笑近來文人學士，說著王冕，都稱他做王參軍！究竟王冕何曾做過一日官？所以表白一番。這不過是個楔子，下面還有正文。,"Wang Mian lived as a hermit in Kuaiji Mountain, and never disclosed his real name. When later he fell ill and died, his neighbours there collected some money and buried him at the foot of the mountain. During the same year, Old Qin died of old age in his home. Curiously enough, writers and scholars nowadays refer to Wang Mian as the Commissioner of Records, though actually he never served as an official for a single day, as I have tried to make clear. The foregoing is only the introduction to the story which I shall now begin."
