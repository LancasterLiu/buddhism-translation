I. 1 CONDUCT OF AKITTI [*1] (Akitticariyaṃ)
1. In the interval between now [*2] and a hundred thousand eons and four incalculables ago, all that conduct [*3] was maturing for Awakening.
2. Setting aside conduct in many an existence in past eons, I will speak of conduct in this eon. Listen to me. [*4]
3. When I, having plunged [*5] into a huge forest, into an empty [*6] open forest-glade [*7], was living as an ascetic named Akitti,
4. Then the overlord of the Threefold Heaven [*8] (his ornamental seat) warmed by the incandescence of my austerity, approached me for almsfood in the guise of a brahman. 
[page 2]
5. Seeing him standing at my door [*1], together with the receptacle (for food) I scattered (before him) leaves gathered from the forest, without oil and without salt. [*2]
6. Having given him the leaves, I, turning the (food-) vessel upside down, abandoning a further search [*3] (for alms), entered the little leaf-hut.
7. And a second and a third time he came up to me. Unmoved, without clinging [*4], I gave as before.
8. By reason of this [5] there was no discolouration of my physical frame. With zest and happiness, with delight I spent that day.
9. If for only a month or for two months I were to find a worthy recipient, unmoved, unflinching, I would give the supreme gift. 
10. While I was giving him the gift I did not aspire for fame or gain. Aspiring for omniscience I did those deeds (of merit).

Saṅkhacariyaṃ dutiyaṃ","I. 2 CONDUCT OF SAṄKHA [*6] (Saṅkhacariyaṃ)
1. And again, when I was the brahman called Saṅkha, wanting to cross over the great ocean I was on my way to the port. [*7]
2. There I saw [*8] on the opposite side of the way a self-become one, [*9] an unconquered one [*10] faring along a desert-path whose ground was hot and rough.
3. When I saw him on the opposite side of the way, I investigated this matter: “This is a field (for merit) that has been reached by a person desiring merit. 
[page 3]
4. Just as a cultivator, seeing a field that would yield a great return, does not sow seed there, he cannot be in need of grain,
5. Even so I, desiring merit, seeing the glorious and superb field [*1] (for merit), if I do not render service there, I cannot be in need of merit. 
6. Just as a minister, desiring power [*2] over the persons in a king’s palace, does not give them wealth and grain, he dwindles in power,
7. Even so I, desiring merit, seeing one eminently worthy of a gift of faith, if I do not give him a gift, I will dwindle in merit”.
8. Thinking thus I, taking off (my) sandals [*3], honouring his feet, gave him sunshade and sandals.
9. I who was even a hundred times (more) delicate and comfortably nurtured [*4] than him, yet fulfilling (the perfection of) Giving, thus I gave him (these things I needed more than he did).
  Notes:
7. The port of Tāmalitti, in order to take a boat for Suvaṇṇabhūmi (Burma?), CpA. 28. 
8. Ee tattha adassiṃ, Ce tatth’ addasāmi, Be tatth’ adassaṃ.
9. A paccekabuddha, CpA. 28. 
10. Not conquered by any one of the kilesamāras, defilements, and so forth. CpA. 28 speaks of 3 Māras.
1. The paccekabuddha. 
2. muddi, power, authority, a rare word. Cf. muddikaṃ āharāpesi, DhA. ii. 4, and muddikaṃ deti, Miln. 379.
3. orohitva upāhanā, an unusual expression. At Vin, ii, 207f. monks coming into a monastery have to take off their sandals, upāhanā omuñcitvā, (as a sign of respect). But according to Jā No. 442 (iv. 16) the paccekabuddha knew the brahman would be shipwrecked but saved from drowning by his gift of sandals.
4. Even so, indifferent to his own physical hardship, he gave the paccekabuddha his own sunshade and sandals. ‘Comfortably nurtured’—Be, Ce, v. l. sukhedhita; Ee, sukkheṭhita."

Kurudhammacariyaṃ tatiyaṃ","I. 3 CONDUCT ACCORDING TO THE KURU MORALITY [*5] (Kurudhammacariyaṃ)
1. And again, when I was a king named Dhanañjaya in the superb city of Indapatta [*6] I was furnished with the ten skilled (ways of acting). [*7]
[page 4]
2. Brahmans from the realm of the kingdom of Kāliṅga approached me; they requested me for the elephant-nāga [*1] which was regarded as auspicious and of good omen.
3. “The country has a drought, is short of food, there is a great famine. Give (us) the glorious black [*2] elephant [*3] called Añjana.”
4. A refusal by me was not suitable when a supplicant had arrived. (I thought), “let not my undertaking [*4] be torn. I will give the mighty elephant [*5].”
5. Having taken the elephant [*6] by the trunk, sprinkling water from a jewelled ceremonial vessel over the hand [*7] I gave the elephant [*5] to the brahmans. 
6. When he had bestowed this [*8] elephant [*6] the ministers spoke thus: “Why did you bestow the glorious elephant [*6] on the supplicants?
7. Auspicious, possessed of good omen, supreme in conquest in battle, now that the elephant [*6] has been bestowed what will your kingdom do?”
8. I would give even the whole of my kingdom, I would give my own body. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave the elephant. [*9]

Notes:
5. Kurudhammajātaka, No. 276. Justification for the name “The Story of Dhanañjaya” as heading in Ee is apparently internal, for at end of the verses the name is Kurudhammacariyaṃ; at CpA. 35, Ce, Be it is Kururājacariyaṃ. Also see DhA. iv. 86ff. where, at p. 88 as at Jā. ii. 367, the Kurudhammā are called the 5 sīla, moral habits.
6. So Ce, CpA. But Indapaṭṭha in Ee, -pattha in Be.
7. CpA. 35, these are either the ten puññakiriyavatthu, grounds for making merit (see e.g. MA. i. 132, UJ. 285), or the ten kusalakammapatha (see e.g. D. iii. 269, M. i. 287, A. v. 266ff., cf. Netti. 43.), i.e. three skilled ways of acting by body, four by speech, three by thought. Also below, II. 8, 2; III. 14, 2. Morris’s surmise that kusale, in kusale dasehi, is “merely a contracted form for kusalehi” (see his Preface, p. xvi, n. 3 to Ee) is borne out by CpA. 35.
1. hatthināga. 
2. nīla, not always dark blue, sometimes a lustrous black, see Bud. Psych. Ethics, p. 62, n. 
3 nāga. They said this believing he would bring rain, CpA. 35. Below, ver. 7 suggests that without him there might be a drought.
4. The gaining of omniscience.
5. gaja.
6. nāga.
7. Water of dedication.
8. CpA. 38, Ce, Be tassa, ‘by him’, Ee tasmiṃ.

Mahāsudassanacariyaṃ catutthaṃ","I. 4 CONDUCT OF MAHĀ-SUDASSANA [*10] (Mahāsudassanacariyam) [sic]
1. When in the city of Kusāvatī I was lord of the earth, named Mahā-Sudassana, a wheel-turner, very powerful,
[page 5]
2. I had it proclaimed there three times daily in this place and that: Who wants, desires what? To whom what is the wealth to be given?
3. Who is hungry? Who thirsty? Who (wants) a garland, who an unguent? Who, being naked, will put on many-hued raiment?
4. Who will take a parasol on the highway, who sandals, soft and pleasant? [*1] Thus in the evening and at dawn I had it proclaimed in this place and that.
5. Not in ten places nor merely in a hundred places, in countless hundreds of places wealth was got ready for the supplicants.
6. If there came a mendicant beggar [*2], whether by day or by night, receiving whatever goods [*3] he wanted he went away with his hands full.
7. I gave a great gift such as this as long as my life lasted. I gave the wealth not because it was disagreeable nor did I not have a hoard [*4].
8. Just as an invalid in order to recover from an illness, satisfying the doctor [*5] with (some) wealth, recovers from the illness,
9. Even so did I, realizing [*6] it, in order to achieve complete fulfilment [*7] and to fill the mind that was lacking in contentment [*8], give gifts to mendicant beggars [*9] without attachment, expecting nothing in return, [*10] for the attainment of Self-Awakening.
  Notes:

2. Then I, with whatever offerings I had in the seven kingdoms, gave great gifts, imperturbable like the ocean.  [*1]

2. I had then four halls built (each) with four entrances [*6]. There I conferred gifts on beasts, birds, men and so forth [*7],
3. Clothing and beds and food and drink and (a variety [*8] of other) victuals—I conferred great gifts, making them continual. [*9]

2. Then I, freed from (being made a) sacrifice, issuing forth from the sacrificial pit [*1], stirring up a deep thrill [*2], conferred a great gift.
3. I did not drink, I did not eat [*3], nor did I partake of soft food even for five or six nights without having given to one worthy of offerings.
4. Just as a merchant making a store of goods takes the goods there [*4] where the profits are great,
5. Even so, even from what one has himself used, what is given to others is of great fruit; therefore what is to be given to others will become a hundredfold.

Sivirājacariyaṃ aṭṭhamaṃ","I. 8 CONDUCT OF KING SIVI [*7] (Sivirājacariyaṃ) 
1. In the city called Ariṭṭha I was a warrior-noble named Sivi. Seated in a glorious palace I thought thus then: 
2. “Whatever is a human gift [*8] there is none that has not been given by me. Even if someone should request me for an eye I would give it, unmoved.”
3. Knowing my desire Sakka, lord of devas, sitting in a company of devas, spoke these words:
4. “Seated in a glorious palace Sivi the king, of great psychic potency, thinking of various gifts, does not see what could not be given.
5. Come, I will test [*9] him as to whether this is true, not untrue. Wait for a moment till I know his mind.” 
[page 8]
6. Appearing as a trembling, grey-haired man [*1], with wrinkled limbs, old, ill, and blind, he approached the king. 
7. Stretching out his left and right arms then, bringing his clasped hands to his head, he spoke these words: 
8. “I request you, great king, who have fostered the kingdom righteously, whose renown for delight in giving has spread to devas and men:
9. Even both my eyes, my guides, are blind, destroyed. Give me one eye, you too [*2] keep going with one.” 
10. When I had heard his words, elated, deeply thrilled in mind, [*3] my hands clasped, filled with enthusiasm, I spoke these words:
11. “Now I, thinking (of this) am come here from the palace; you, knowing my mind, are come to request an eye.
12. Ah, my intention is accomplished, fulfilled is my desire. Today I will give a glorious gift not given before to a supplicant.”
13. “Come, Sīvaka [*4], be up and doing, do not linger [*5], do not tremble. Plucking out even both eyes [*6] give to the mendicant beggar.” [*7] 
14. Thereupon Sīvaka, urged on by me, doing my bidding, tearing (them) out like the pith of a palm-tree [*8] bestowed them on the supplicant.
15. While I was desiring to give, while I was giving, and after the gift had been given by me, there was no contrariety of mind [*9]; it was for the sake of Awakening itself.
16. The two eyes were not disagreeable to me nor was myself [*10] disagreeable to me. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave the eye(s).

Vessantaracariyaṃ navamaṃ","I. 9 CONDUCT OF VESSANTARA [*1] (Vessantaracariyaṃ)
1. She who was my mother, the warrior-noble lady named Phusatī [*2] and Sakka’s chief consort [*3] in a former birth [*4]—
2. On seeing [*5] the destruction of her life-span, the lord of devas spoke thus, “I am giving you ten boons, lovely one, choose [*6] the boon you wish.”
3. And when this had been said that devī spoke of this again [*7] to Sakka, “In what way is there a fault in me? In what way am I disagreeable to you that you cause me to decease from a delightful place as the wind (blows down) a dharaṇīruha [*8]?”
4. And when this had been said, Sakka again said this to her, “It is not at all that you have done any evil and nor are you not dear to me.
5. To this extent only is your life-span; it must be the time for deceasing. Accept the boons given by me, ten incomparable boons.”
6. She, Phusatī, given the boons by Sakka, elated, exultant, joyous, accepted the ten boons including myself. [*9] 
7. She, Phusatī, deceasing from there, arose among warrior nobles in the city of Jetuttara [*10], and wedded Sañjaya.
8. When I descended into the womb of Phusatī, my dear mother, through my incandescence my mother was always delighting in giving. 
[page 10]
9. She gave gifts to the destitute, the sick, the old, to supplicants, to people travelling [*1], to recluses and brahmans, to those who had lost their property [*2], to those who had nothing.
10. Phusatī, carrying me for ten months, making a circuit of the city gave birth to me in the street of the vessa. [*3]
11. My name was not from my mother’s side [*4] nor yet did it originate from my father’s [*5]. As I was born there [*6] in the street of the merchants therefore Vessanatara [*7] was I called.
12. When I was a boy, eight years old, seated in the palace then I thought of giving gifts.
13. I would give my heart, eyes, flesh and even too my blood, I made it known [*8] I would give my body should anyone request me.
14. While I was considering my state (of mind) which was unmoved, steadfast, the earth, garlanded with Sineru’s (celestial) Groves [*9], trembled there.
15. Every fortnight [*10] (and invariably) on the full moon day, the Observance (day), I mounted the elephant Paccaya and went to give a gift.
16. [*11] Brahmans from the realm of the kingdom of Kāliṅga approached me; they requested me for the elephant-nāga which was regarded as auspicious and of good omen:
17. “The country has a drought, is short of food, there is a great famine. Give (us) the glorious all-white elephant, supreme among elephants.”
[page 11]
18. I did not waver, I gave whatever the brahmans requested of me. I did not conceal what was there (in my possession), my mind delighted in giving.
19. A refusal by me was not suitable when a supplicant had arrived. (I thought) “let not my undertaking be torn. I will give the mighty elephant.”
20. Having taken the elephant by the trunk, sprinkling water from a jewelled ceremonial vessel over the hand, I gave the elephant to the brahmans.
21. And again, when I was giving the superb all-white elephant the earth, garlanded with Sineru’s (celestial) Groves, trembled then too.
22 At the gift of the elephant the people of Sivi, [*1] angry, gathered together; they banished me from my own kingdom (saying), “Let him go to Mount Vaṅka.”
23. While they were driving me out, unmoved, steadfast, I requested [*2] one boon: to confer a great gift.
24. On being requested, all the people of Sivi gave me the one boon. I, having a pair of drums [*3] sounded [*4], gave the great gift. 
25. Then at this sound great was the tumult, the dread. Because of that (earlier) gift [*5] they threw me out—I gave the gift again.
26. Giving elephants, horses, chariots, women and men slaves, cattle, riches—having given the great gift, I departed from the city then.
27. When I had departed from the city and turned back to look (at it), [*6] the earth, garlanded with Sineru’s (celestial) Groves, trembled then too.
28. Giving the chariot drawn by four horses [*7], standing quite alone without a companion at a great cross-road, I said to the lady Maddī: 
[page 12]
29. “You, Maddī, take Kaṇhā, she is light and the younger. I will take Jāli for heavy is he being the brother”.
30. Maddī took up Kaṇhājinā as though she were a blue lotus (or) a white water-lily. I took up the warrior-noble Jāli as though he were a golden gourd. [*1]
31. Four warrior-noble people, well-born, delicately nurtured, walking on uneven and on even (ground), were going towards Mount Vaṅka.
32. Whatever people were coming [*2] the same way or from the opposite direction, we asked them the way saying, “Where is Mount Vaṅka?”
33. Seeing us there they uttered compassionate words, they made known their sorrow—far away was Mount Vaṅka.
34. If the children saw trees in fruit in the forest [*3], the children cried out for these fruits.
35. When the tall [*4] massive trees saw that the children were crying, bending down of their own accord, they came within reach of the children.
36. Seeing this marvel, wonderful, astounding, Maddī, beautiful in every limb, gave applause.
37. “A marvel indeed in the world, wonderful, astounding. The trees have bent down of themselves through Vessantara’s incandescence.” [*5]
38. Out of compassion for the children yakkhas shortened the path; on the very day they set out they reached the Ceta kingdom.
39. Sixty thousand kings were living then in Mātula. [*6] All, holding up their clasped hands, weeping [*7], came forward.
40. When they had held conversation there with the Ceta (kings) and their sons, departing from there they [*8] came to Mount Vaṅka. 
[page 13]
41. The lord of devas, addressing Vissakamma [*1] who was of great psychic potency, said, “Create properly a well-made hermitage, a delightful leaf-hut.”
42. When Vissakamma [*1] who was of great psychic potency had heard Sakka’s words, he created properly a well-made hermitage, a delightful leaf-hut.
43. Plunging into the forest which was quiet and undisturbed, we four people lived there on the mountain.
44. I and the lady Maddī and both Jāli and Kaṇhājinā lived in the hermitage then dispelling each other’s sorrow.
45. Keeping guard over the children I was not idle [*2] in the hermitage. Maddī fetched fruits, she fed three people.
46. While I was living in the forest a traveller approached me. He requested me for both the little children, Jāli and Kaṇhājinā.
47. Seeing the supplicant approaching, joy arose in me [*3]. Taking hold of both children, I gave them to the brahman then.
48. When I was relinquishing my own children to the brahman supplicant, the earth, garlanded with Sineru’s (celestial) Groves, trembled then too.
49. And again, Sakka, descending in the guise of a brahman, requested me for the lady Maddī who was virtuous [*4], a chaste wife.
50. Taking Maddī by the hand, filling the clasped hands with water [*5], having a mind of faith in my purpose [*6], to him Maddī I gave.
51. As Maddī was being given the devas in the heavens were rejoiced; the earth, garlanded with Sineru’s (celestial) Groves, trembled then too.
52. Jāli (my son), Kaṇhājinā my daughter, the lady Maddī, a
[page 14]
chaste wife—relinquishing them I did not think [*1]; it was for the sake of Awakening itself. [*2]
53. Neither child was disagreeable to me, the lady Maddī was not disagreeable. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave away those who were dear. [*3]
54. And again in the company of my parents [*4] in the vast forest, when they were lamenting compassionately and talking about my happiness and sorrow [*5],
55. I approached them both with shame and fear of blame, with reverence; the earth, garlanded with Sineru’s (celestial) Groves, trembled then too.
56. And again, having departed from the vast forest with my relations, [*6] I entered [*7] the delightful city Jetuttara, supreme among cities.
57. The seven (kinds of) gems rained down, a great rain-cloud showered down; the earth, garlanded with Sineru’s (celestial) Groves, trembled then too.
58. Even this cognizant earth, not knowing happiness or sorrow [*5], at the power of my giving quaked seven times. [*8]

1. And again, when I was a hare who roamed in the forest, feeding on grass, leaves, herbs and fruit, refraining from oppressing others,
[page 15]
2. A monkey, a jackal, a young otter and I dwelt then in the same neighbourhood and were to be seen evening and morning. [*1]
3. I instructed them as to lovely and evil deeds: “Shun the evil ones, keep to the lovely ones” [*2]
4. Seeing the moon at the full on an Observance day, I pointed it out to them there saying, “Today is an Observance (day).
5. Prepare gifts to give to one worthy of gifts; having given the gift to one worthy of gifts, observe the Observance (day).”
6. Saying “Very well” to me, having prepared gifts according to their ability, according to their means, they sought [*3] one worthy of gifts.
7. Seated there I thought about [*4] a worthy, suitable gift: “If I should get someone worthy of gifts, what would be my gift? 
8. I have no sesamum, gram or beans, [*5] rice, clarified butter. I keep myself going on grass; it is not possible to give grass. 
9. If anyone [*6] worthy of gifts comes into my presence for food I will give my own self; he will not go away empty.”
10. Knowing my intention, Sakka in the guise of a brahman approached my lair so as to test my giving.
11. When I saw him, elated I spoke these words, “It is good that for the sake of fodder you have reached my presence. [*7] 
12. Today I will give you a glorious gift not given before. You are furnished with moral virtue; unfitting in you is the oppressing of others.
13. Come, light a fire, collect different kinds of sticks. I will roast myself, you will devour (me) roasted.”
14. He saying “Very well”, exultant in mind, collected different
[page 16]
kinds of sticks; making a womb of embers he made a huge pyre.
15. He lit a fire there that would become big quickly. Shaking my dust covered limbs, [*1] I sat down at one side.
16. When the great pile [*2] of sticks was burning and roaring [*3], leaping up then I fell down into the middle of the blazing flames.
17. As anyone entering into cool water allays [*4] his distress and fever and finds [*5] satisfaction and zest, 
18. So did the burning fire when I entered it allay all my distress as though it were cool water.
19. I gave to the brahman the whole of my entire body, the outer skin, inner skin, flesh, sinews, bones, and the muscles of the heart. [*6]

II. 1 CONDUCT OF A MOTHER’S SUPPORTER [*1] (Mātiposakacariyaṃ)
1. When I was a lordly elephant [*2] in a forest supporting my mother there was none then on earth like me in respect of (moral) virtues. [*3] 
2. A forester, having seen me in the forest, informed the king about me: “Sire, an elephant [*4] befitting you is living in a forest-glade.
3. There is no need of precautions for him, nor even of pit or stake. [*5] If he is taken [*6] by the trunk he will come here himself.”
4. When he had heard his words the king, joyful in mind, sent an elephant-tamer, a skilful teacher, well-trained.
5. That elephant-tamer, going there, saw (me) in a lotus-pond pulling out lotus roots [*7] for my mother’s sustenance.
6. Discerning my moral virtue he looked out for distinguishing marks. Saying, ‘Come, son’, he held me by my trunk.
7. What was then the natural strength of my physical frame is today exactly the same as the strength of a thousand elephants.
8. Had I been angry with those who came to capture me I was
[page 19]
capable of crushing to death even the whole kingdom of men. [*1]
9. Yet I, for the sake of guarding morality, for fulfilling the perfection of Morality, would not change my mind (even though) they were tethering [*2] me to a stake [*3].
10. If they had attacked me there with axes and spears I would not even have been angry with them for fear of breaking my morality.

1. And again, when I was Bhūridatta [*5], of great psychic potency [*6], I went to a deva-world [*7] with the great king Virūpakkha [*8].
2. There I, seeing devas who were entirely given over to happiness, undertook the vow of morality for the sake of going to [*9] that heaven.
3. Having seen to my physical needs, [*10] having eaten enough to keep myself going, resolutely determining on the four factors [*11], I lay down on top of an anthill.
4. He who had some need of my inner skin, outer skin, flesh, sinews or bones, let him take it away, given as it was. [*12]
[page 20]
5. As I was lying down the ungrateful Ālampāna [*1] caught me. Having thrown me into a basket he made me perform in this place and that.
6. Even though thrown into a basket, even though crushed down by his hands, I was not angry with Ālampāna [*2] for fear of breaking my morality.
7. The sacrifice of my own life was (more) trifling to me than that of grass. The transgression of morality was to me like the earth inverted. [*3]
8. In a hundred successive births I could sacrifice my life rather than violate morality even for the sake of (reigning over) the four continents.
9. So I, for the sake of guarding morality, for fulfilling the perfection of Morality, would not change my mind even though they were throwing (me) into the basket. [*4]
  Notes:
4. Bhūridatta-jātaka, No. 543.

9. Ibid. arising in, i.e., in some future birth.
10. Ibid, such as washing the face. 
11. As at II. 10. 2. The four are the ‘fourfold energy’ of MA. iii. 194 on M. i. 481 = S. ii. 28=A. i. 50: “gladly would I be reduced to skin, sinews, bone and let my body’s flesh and blood dry up.” See next ver., and CpA. 117, which says chavicamma is one factor, the rest are to be taken separately. It is therefore misleading of BCL to annotate: “the four constituents are Sīla, Samādhi, Paññā, Vimutti”, though these form another 4 aṅga, factors, constituents, at A. ii. 79.

2. Even then, a snake-charmer [*8] catching me who was a Dhamma-farer [*9], who observed the Observance (days), made me perform [*10] at the royal gateway. [*11]
3. Assuming the colour he had thought of—blue, yellow or red [*12], I was obedient to his intention, carrying out his thoughts.

4. I could have turned dry land to water and turned water to dry land. If I had been angry with him I could have reduced him to ashes in a moment.
5. Had I been under the mastery of mind, I would have fallen away from morality; the supreme aim [*1] does not succeed for one who has fallen away in respect of morality.

1. And again, when I was Cūḷabodhi, very virtuous, seeing becoming as a peril, I departed on the Departure. [*4]
2. She who had been my wife [*5], a brahman lady of golden-coloured skin, without expectation in the round [*6] (of rebirths), departed on the Departure.
3. Without attachment, [*7] kinsmen [*8] cut off, without expectation from a family or company [*9], walking along to village and market-town, we reached Bārāṇasī.
4. There we lived prudently, not in association with a family (or) company; we both lived in the royal pleasaunce, undisturbed, (where there was) little noise. [*10]
5. When the king went to see the pleasaunce he saw the brahman lady. Approaching me he asked, “Is she yours? Whose wife is she?” [*11]
[page 22]
6. This said, I spoke these words to him, “She is not my wife [*1]; she is of the same persuasion, the one dispensation”.
7. Infatuated with her [*2] he had his hirelings [*3] seize her; compelling her by force he made her enter the inner appartments of the palace.
8. She who had been mine by touching a water-jar [*4], conatal [*5], of the one dispensation—when he dragged her along and she was being led away, anger arose in me.
9. With anger arising I recollected the observance of the vow of morality [*6]; then and there I held back (my) anger, I did not let it increase further [*7].
10. If anyone were to attack that brahman lady with a sharp knife, for the sake of Awakening itself never would I violate morality.

1. And again, when I was a buffalo roaming in a forest [*9], very well-grown in body, strong, large, terrifying to behold,
2. Here and there in a mountain-cave [*10], on a rough hillside and
[page 23]
at the root of a tree, near a water-course, there was some place or other for buffaloes.
3. Wandering about in the huge forest I saw a favourable place [*1]. Going to that place I stood and I lay down.
4. Then an evil, foul, nimble monkey came there and urinated and defecated over my shoulder, forehead and eyebrows.
5. And on one day, even on a second, a third and a fourth too, the polluted me. All the time I was distressed by him.
6. A yakkha, seeing my distress, said this to me, “Kill that vile evil one with horns and hoofs.”
7. This spoken, I said this then to that yakkha, “How is it that you (would) besmear me with a carcase, evil and foul [*2]?
8. If I were to be angry with him, from that I would become more degraded than him; [*3] and morality might be violated by me and wise men might censure me.
9. Better indeed is death through (leading a life of) purity [*4] than a life subject to disdain. How will I, even for the sake of life, do an injury to another?
10. This one, [*5] thinking thus of me, will do the same to others and they will kill him there; for me this will be freedom. [*6]
11. This one of wisdom, forgiving [*7] disrespect among low, middling, high, thus obtains, intent of mind, according as he aspired.” [*8]

1. And again, when I was Ruru, the deer-king, resembling fine burnished [*2] gold, concentrated on the highest morality, [*3]
2. I approached a pleasant region, delightful, secluded, without human beings, and dwelt there on a charming bank of the Ganges.
3. Then at the upper reaches of the Ganges a man, hard pressed by creditors, fell [*4] into the Ganges (thinking), “I live or I die”. [*5]
4. Day and night he, borne along in the great water of the Ganges, crying out a piteous cry, went on in the middle of the Ganges. 
5. I, hearing the piteous sound of his lament, standing on the bank of the Ganges, asked, “What man are you?” 
6. And he, asked by me, explained then his own action, “Terrified of creditors, I jumped, fearful, into the great river.”
7. Taking pity on him, sacrificing [*6] my life, entering (the river [*7]) I dragged him out in the darkness of the night. 
8. When I knew he had recovered [*8] I said this to him, “I ask one boon of you: tell no-one about me” [*9].
9. Going to the city, when questioned he conveyed (this news) for the sake of wealth. Bringing the king, he came close to me. 
10. All that had been done by me was told to the king. The king,
[page 25]
hearing the words fitted his arrow, “Here will I kill this ignoble betrayer of a friend.”
11. I, shielding him, substituted [*1] myself, “Let him be, sire, I will be he who carries out your will and pleasure”.
12. I guarded my morality, I did not guard my life, for I was then one of morality for the sake of Awakening itself.

4. If I had been angry [*6] with him, if I had not protected morality, I, by (merely) looking at him, could have made him like ashes.

So he instructed them to get a lump of clay and put it on the brahman’s head. Then he let the sun rise whereupon the lump of clay broke into seven pieces. So the brahman was freed from the recoil of his curse."

1. In the kingdom of Pañcāla in the city of Kampilā [*5], the incomparable city, the king named Jayaddisa [*6] had attained the qualities of morality.
2. I was that king’s son, well-instructed [*7], of great morality, Alīnasattu, having (virtuous) qualities [*8], always caring for the attendants. [*9]
3. My father who had gone deer-hunting met a man-eater [*10]. He seized my father (and said), “You are my prey, do not move.”
4. Hearing those words of his he was alarmed and trembled with terror; his thighs became rigid on seeing that man-eater.
5. “Taking the venison, let me go free”. Making a promise to return again and giving wealth to the brahman [*11], my father addressed me: 
6. “Son, take care of the kingdom, do not neglect this city. I promised the man-eater to return.”
[page 28]
7. Having honoured my mother and father, substituting myself, [*1] discarding bow and sword I approached the man-eater.
8. Approaching him with weapons in my hand perhaps he would be afraid. If I roused dread in him so would morality be violated.
9. I did not speak what was disagreeable to him for fear of breaking my morality. With a mind of loving-kindness, of benign speech [*2], I spoke these words:
10. “Kindle a great fire. I will fall (on it) from a tree [*3]. Knowing when the time has come you, grandfather [*4], can eat.”
11. Thus for the sake of moral vow I did not guard my life. And I banished forever his tendency for (making) onslaught on creatures.

3. He who had some need of my inner skin, outer skin, flesh, sinews or bones, let him take it away, given as it was. [*8]
4. Hunter-boys [*9], rough, harsh, pitiless, saw me and came up to me there, sticks and clubs in their hands.
5. Piercing my nostrils, tail and backbone, placing me on a carrying-pole, the hunter-boys bore me off. 
[page 29]
6. If I wishing it, I could have burnt there with the breath of my nose this sea-girt earth [*1] with the forests, with the mountains.
7. Though pierced by stakes, though hacked about by knives, I was not angry with the hunter-boys—this was my perfection of Morality. [*2]

III. 1 CONDUCT OF YUDHAÑJAYA [*1] (Yudhañjayacariyaṃ)
1. When I was Yudhañjaya, the king’s son, of immeasurable renown, I thrilled when I saw a dew-drop fallen down in the warmth of the sun. [*2]
2. Taking that itself as the sign I increased the thrill. Honouring my mother and father I requested (their consent) for the going forth.
3. Their hands folded, with the citizens, with the inhabitants of the kingdom, they begged me, “Son, this very day take care of the great estate [*3] which is rich and prosperous”. 
4. While the (multitude) together with the king, the court ladies, the citizens and the inhabitants of the kingdom, were lamenting piteously, I went forth [*4] without expectation.
5. It was for the sake of Awakening itself that, renouncing the sovereignty of the entire earth, relations, retinue, renown, I did not think (anything about it [*5]).
6. Mother and father were not disagreeable to me, and nor was the great retinue disagreeable to me [*6]. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave up the kingdom.

III. 2 CONDUCT OF SOMANASSA [*1] (Somanassacariyaṃ)
1. And again, when in the incomparable city of Indapatta [*2], I was the (king’s) son named Somanassa, I had been longed for (by in my parents), was dear (to them), widely famed. 
2. I was virtuous, possessed of (good) qualities [*3], of ready and lovely speech, paying respect to the elderly, modest, and proficient in the bases of sympathy. [*4]
3. An ascetic who was an imposter was [*5] that king’s favourite. He lived [*6] by cultivating the orchard and the flowering shrubs.
4. Seeing him to be an impostor like a heap of chaff without the rice-grain [*7], and [*8] a tree hollow inside, like a plantain-tree with no hard core I (thought),
5. “This one, for the sake of his livelihood, has no (virtuous) conduct [*9] towards what is good, has fallen away from recluse-ship, and abandoned modesty and pure conduct.”
6. The border district was [*10] disturbed by neighbouring wild tribes. My father, on going away to pacify it, instructed me,
7. “Do not you, my dear, neglect the matted-hair ascetic of severe penance. He is the giver of all (our) desires; act in conformity with his wishes.”
8. Going to attend on him, I spoke these words, “I hope you are well, [*11] householder [*12], or what may be brought to you?” [*13]
9. At this the impostor, stuck up with conceit, was angry [*14] and said, “I will have you slain today [*15] or banished from the kingdom.”
10. The king, having pacified the border district, said to the
[page 32]
impostor, “I hope, reverend sir, you are well and honour was paid to you?” The evil one told him why the prince should be killed.
11. When he had heard his words the lord of the earth commanded, “Cut off his head wherever he is [*1] and, with him [*2] in four pieces, display them from street to street—this is the fate [*3] of those who are contemptuous towards matted-hair ascetics.”
12. Accordingly the executioners [*4] fierce, harsh, pitiless, went off and, dragging me away as I was seated on my mother’s lap, [*5] led me away.
13. I spoke thus to them as they were binding me tightly, “Let me appear forthwith before the king—I have business with the king.”
14. They let me appear before the evil king, follower of the evil one. When I saw him I convinced him and brought him under my influence. 
15. He asked my forgiveness therein, he gave me the great kingdom. But I, having burst asunder [*6] the gloom [*7], went forth into homelessness.
16. It was not that the great kingdom was disagreeable to me, enjoyment of sense-pleasures was not disagreeable. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave up the kingdom.

1. And again, when I was own son of the king of Kāsi, grown up in an iron house [*9], I was Ayoghara by name.
2. (My father said), “Having obtained (your) life with difficulty,
[page 33]
nurtured in close confinement [*1], this very day, son, take charge of this whole earth [*2]
3. With the kingdoms, the townships, the people.” Paying homage to the warrior-noble, raising my clasped hands in salutation, I spoke these words,
4. “Whatever the beings on the earth [*3], low, high, middling, without protection they grow up each in his own home together with kinsmen. [*4]
5. This (way of) nurturing me in confinement is unique in the world. I have grown up in an iron house with no light from moon or sun.
6. Having been released from my mother’s womb which was full of obnoxious, offensive matter, from there again I was thrown into more frightful anguish in the iron house.
7. If I, having come to the cruellest anguish such as this, were to find pleasure in sovereignty [*5] I would be the most degraded [*6] of evil ones.
8. I am wearied of the body, I have no need of sovereignty. I shall seek for waning out where death shall not crush me.”
9. Thinking thus while the populace was wailing aloud [*7], like an elephant bursting asunder its bonds [*8] I entered the forest, the (great) wood.
10. Mother and father were not disagreeable to me, and nor was great renown disagreeable to me. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave up the kingdom. [*9]

1. And again, when I was in the glorious incomparable city of the Kāsis a sister and [*3] seven brothers had been born in a learned (brahman [*4]) family. 
2. I was the first-born of these, furnished with the pure (virtue of) conscientiousness. Seeing becoming as a peril, I greatly delighted in renunciation.
3. Sent by my mother and father, my friends unanimously invited me to sense-pleasures: “Maintain the family lineage”, they said.
4 Whatever they said regarding what brings happiness in the household state, to me was like a hard, heated ploughshare. [*5]
5. They then asked me, who was rejecting (the household state), about my aspiration, “What do you aspire for [*6], friend, that you do not enjoy sense-pleasure?”
6.  I, desiring my own good [*7], spoke thus to these who were seeking my welfare, “I do not aspire for the household state, I greatly delight in renunciation.”
7. When they had heard my words, they informed [*8] my father and mother. My mother and father spoke thus, “Then, good sirs [*9], we are all [*10] going forth.” 
8. We, both my mother and father, sister and [*11] the seven brothers, casting aside immense wealth, entered the great wood.

1. And again, when I was in the city of Brahmavaḍḍhana [*3] I was born there in a high family, eminent, very wealthy.
2. Even then, seeing that the (whole) world was blind, smothered in gloom [*4], my mind recoiled from becoming as if harshly pricked by a goad.

4. When I awoke after sleeping on the glorious bed I then saw the pale sunshade by means of which I had gone to purgatory. [*5]
5. At the sight of the sunshade a terrible dread arose in me. I reached the decision “How [*6] shall I release [*7] this [*8]?”
6. A devatā who formerly had been a blood-relation of mine [*9], desiring my weal, seeing me anguished, advised me about three (kinds of) behaviour [*10]:
[page 37]
7. “Show no intelligence [*1], to all creatures be like a fool [*2], let all people heap scorn on you [*3]—thus will there be weal for you. [4]”
8. [*5] When this had been said I spoke these words to her, “I will do your bidding as you [*6] say, devatā. You wish me weal, my dear, you wish me welfare, devatā.”
9. When I had heard her words I obtained as it were dry land in the sea. Exultant, thrilled in mind, I resolutely determined on the three factors:
10. I was dumb, deaf, a cripple—unable to walk. [*7] Resolutely determining on these factors I lived for sixteen years.
11. Then they, rubbing my hands, feet, tongue and ears [*8], seeing no defect in me designated me ‘inauspicious one’ [*9].
12. Then all the people of the country [*10], the generals and priests, all being unanimous, approved of casting me aside.
13. I, when I had heard their opinion, was exultant, thrilled in mind (for) the purpose for which I had practised austerity was a purpose that had prospered for me.
14. Having bathed me, rubbed me with ointment, fastened the royal diadem (to my head [*11]), having ceremonially anointed me, they had me make a circuit of the city under the sunshade. 
15. Holding it aloft for seven days, (one day) when the orb of the sun had arisen the charioteer, having taken me out in a chariot, came to a wood.
16. Keeping the chariot in an open space, the bridled horse set free from his hand [*12], the charioteer dug a pit to bury me in the ground.
17. Fearing [*13] for the resolute determination that in the various 
[page 38]
ways [*1] was resolutely determined on, I did not break that resolute determination which was for the sake of Awakening itself.
18. Mother and father were not disagreeable to me and nor was self disagreeable to me [*3]. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I resolutely determined on that itself. [*4]
19. Resolutely determining on those factors I lived for sixteen years. There was no one equal to me [*5] in resolute determination—this was my perfection of Resolute Determination.

III. 7 CONDUCT OF THE MONKEY-KING [*1] (Kapirājacariyaṃ)
1. When I was a monkey (living) in a lair in a cleft of a river-bank, harrassed by a crocodile [*2] I had no opportunity of going (to the island) [*3].
2. In that place where I used to stand [*4] (when I had jumped) from the hither bank and descended on the further (bank) [*5], there sat the crocodile, an enemy, [*6] a killer, fierce of aspect. [*7]
3. He spoke [*8] to me saying ‘Come’. ‘I am coming’ [*9] I said [*10] to him. Stepping on to his head, I gained [*11] the further bank.
4. No untruth was spoken to him, I acted according to my word [*12]. There was no one to equal me in truth—this was my perfection of Truth.

1. And again, when I was a young quail in Magadha, wings (as yet) not grown, newly hatched, a morsel of flesh in the nest,
2. My mother reared me (on food) she brought in her beak; I lived by means of contact with her, I had no bodily strength.
3. Every year in the hot season a forest-fire [*7] would blaze. (Once) the fire [*8], black-trailed, came close to us.
4 The great fire [*9], making sounds like Dhūma Dhūma [*10], a blazing fire [*11], gradually came close to me.
5. My mother and father, alarmed and terrified with fear at the ferocity of the fire [*11], abandoning me in the nest, saved themselves.
[page 41]
6. I strove [*1] with feet, with wings. I had no bodily strength. As I could not go [*2], there [*3] I thought thus then: 
7. Those to whom I, alarmed, terrified, trembling, should run, have gone leaving me behind. How should I act today?
8. In the world is the quality of morality, there is truth, purity, mercy. [*4] By this truth I will make a supreme asseveration of truth:
9. Reflecting on the power of Dhamma, remembering former Conquerors, relying on [*5] the power of truth, I made an asseveration of truth:
10 “Wings there are that fly not, feet there are that walk not [*6]. Mother and father are gone away. Jātaveda [*7], recede.”
11. With truth asseverated by me, the great burning fire [*8] drew back sixteen karīsas (and was) like a fire [*10] that has reached water. There was no one to equal me in truth—this was my perfection of Truth.

1. And again, when I was a fish-king in a large lake the water in the lake dried up in the hot season [*12] in the heat of the sun. 
[page 42]
2. Then crows and vultures and herons [*1], hawks and falcons, sitting near the fish [*2] devoured them day and night.
3. Oppressed there together with my relations, I thought thus, “Now, by what means can I set free my relations from suffering?”
4. Having considered the good in Dhamma [*3], I saw truth as a support. Standing firm in truth, I removed that great destruction of my relations. 
5. Having recollected the true Dhamma [*4], considering the highest good, I made an asseveration of truth that would be lasting, eternal in the world:
6. “As long as I (can) remember about myself, ever since I have come to (years of) discretion I am not aware of having hurt [*5] intentionally even one living thing. By this utterance of truth may Pajjunna [*6] pour down rain.
7. Thunder, Pajjunna! Destroy the treasure-trove of the crows [*7], besiege [*8] the crows with grief, set free the fishes [*9] from grief.”
8. And immediately after the glorious (asseveration of) truth was made, Pajjunna thundered out; and in a moment he poured down rain filling uplands and lowlands. [*10]
9. Putting forth [*11] the utmost energy for the glorious (asseveration of) truth, relying on the power and incandescence of truth, I made a great storm-cloud rain down. There was no one to equal me in truth—this was my perfection of Truth.

III. 11 CONDUCT OF KAṆHADĪPĀYANA [*1] (Kaṇhadīpāyanacariyaṃ)
1. And again, when I was Kaṇhadīpāyana [*2], a seer, I fared dissatisfied [*3] for more than fifty years.
2. No one knew of this dissatisfied mind of mine for [*4] I told no one; the dissatisfaction went on in my mind. [*5]
3. A fellow Brahma-farer, Maṇḍabya, a friend of mine, a great seer, in connexion with a former deed [*6] acquired impalement on a stake.
4. I, after attending to him, restored him to health. Having asked permission [*7] I went back to what was my own hermitage. 
5. A brahman friend of mine, bringing his wife and little son—the three people, coming together, approached as guests. 
6. While I was exchanging greetings with them, seated in my own hermitage, the youth threw a ball along [*8] (and) angered a poisonous snake [*9]. 
7. Then that little boy, looking for the way by which the ball had gone, touched the head of the poisonous snake with his hand. 
8. At his touch, the snake, angered, relying on its strong venom, angry with utmost anger, instantly bit the youth. 
9. As he was bitten by the poisonous snake [*10] the youth fell to the ground, whereby afflicted was I; that sorrow (of the parents) [*11] worked on [*12] mine. 
[page 44]
10. Comforting them that were afflicted, shaken by grief, first of all I made the highest, supremely glorious asseveration of truth:
11. [*1] “For just seven days I, with a mind of faith, desiring merit, fared the Brahma-faring. After that, this that was my [*2] faring for fifty years and more [*3]
12. I fared only unwillingly. By this truth may there be wellbeing [*4], the poison destroyed may Yaññadatta [*5] live.”
13. With this (asseveration of) truth made by me, the brahman youth who had trembled with the strength of the poison, rousing himself, stood up and was well. There was no one equal to me in truth—this was my perfection of Truth.

Notes:
1. Kaṇhadīpāyana-jātaka, No. 444.
2. CpA. 241 explains that the Bodhisatta’s name then was Dīpāyana, but because his body became black in colour as he sat under his friend Maṇḍabya’s body which, in paled on a stake, was dripping with blood, he was known as Dīpāyana the Black.

1. And again, when I was Sutasoma, lord of the earth, captured by a man-eater I remembered my promise [*7] to a brahman.
2. Having strung up a hundred warrior-nobles by the palms of their hands [*8], having let them dry out, [*9] he brought me for sacrifice.
3. The man-eater asked me, “Is it that you wish your release [*10]? I will act according to your pleasure if you will come to see me again.”
[page 45]
4. Having assured him of my return at dawn, approaching the delightful city, I renounced the kingdom then.
5. Recollecting the Dhamma of the good followed by former Conquerors, giving the wealth to the brahman, I approached the man-eater.
6. I had no doubt whether he would kill me or not. Protecting truth-speaking I approached to sacrifice my life. There was no one to equal me in truth—this was my perfection of Truth. [*1]

9. sampamilāpetvā. CpA pamilāpetvā, withered, visosetvā, desiccated, khedāpetvā, tortured. Or is it from the root mil, and not mlā, as suggested by CpA and adopted by PED? But cf. pamilāta at Miln. 303, obviously having the meaning of dried up, withered. 
10. Ee, CpA. 254 nissajjaṃ, Ce, Be nissajaṃ, i.e. from the man-eater’s hands. 
1. I do not see this ver in Jā. No. 537, nor the different one ascribed to it at Jā. i. 46, BvA. 60, ApA. 51 to exemplify the ultimate perfection of truth, paramatthapāramī, but BvA. 60 reads esā me saccapāramī."

III. 13 CONDUCT OF SUVAṆṆA-SĀMA [*1] (Suvaṇṇasāmacariyaṃ [*2])
1. When in a wood I was Sāma, created by Sakka [*3], I brought the lions and tigers in the forest to loving-kindness.
2. Surrounded by lions and tigers, by leopards [*4], bears, buffaloes and by spotted deer and wild boar I lived in the wood.
3. No one was frightened [*5] of me nor did I [*6] fear anyone [*7]; sustained by the power of loving-kindness I delighted in the forest then. [*8]

1. And again, when I was called Ekarājā, widely famed, resolutely determining on the supreme morality [*10], I governed [*11] the great earth.
[page 47]
2. Without exception I practised the ten skilled ways of acting, [*1] I treated the populace kindly with the four bases of generosity [*2].
3. While I was being diligent thus for the sake of this world and the next, Dabbasena, [*3] having approached, sacking my city [*4] (by force of arms),
4. Getting complete possession of the dependants of the king, the townspeople together with the armed forces and with the country-folk, buried [*5] me in a pit. [*6]
5. When he had captured the (whole) body of ministers, the prosperous kingdom, my inner city [*7], I saw even my dear son taken. There was no one to equal me in loving-kindness—this was my perfection of Loving-kindness.
  Notes:
9. Ekarāja-jātaka, No. 303. At DPPN, Jā. i. 47, BvA. 61 it is given as an 
example of a birth where the Bodhisatta practised mettā to the highest perfection. The verse quoted, however, is the last verse in the previous Cp story (III. 13) which is not a story concerning this perfection at its utmost limit. At ApA. 51 it is rightly ascribed to the Sāma-jātaka. 
10. As named in next verse.

III. 15. THE GREAT ASTOUNDING CONDUCT [*1] (Mahālomahaṃsacariyaṃ)
1. [*2] I lay down in a cemetery leaning against [*3] a skeleton. Crowds of rustic children [*4] approached me and displayed a great deal of derisive behaviour.
2. Others, exultant, thrilled in mind, brought (me) offerings of many perfumes and garlands [*5] and a variety of food.
3. Those who caused [*6] me anguish and those who gave me happiness—I was the same to them all; kindliness, anger [*7] did not exist.
4. Having become balanced toward happiness and anguish, toward honours and reproaches [*8], I was the same in all circumstances—this was my perfection of Equanimity.
  Notes:
1. The identification of this cariya with Lomahaṃsa-jātaka, No. 94, is open to doubt. See Intr. p. viii. 2. At Jā. i. 47, BvA. 61, ApA. 51 this verse is cited to illustrate the ultimate perfection of Equanimity, all three passages saying that the full meaning can be obtained from the Cariyāpiṭaka. At M. i. 79 in the Mahāsīhanāda Sta., No. 12, the episode of this verse is called ‘abiding in equanimity’. At the end of the Sta. the Buddha is recorded to advise Nāgasamāla that since his hair had stood on end while he was listening to it he should remember it as the Hair-raising (or Astounding) Disquisition, Lomahaṃsanapariyāya See Intr, p. viii, also my Ten Jātaka Stories, London, 1957, Intr. p. xxi.
