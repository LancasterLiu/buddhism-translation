The King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), observed the Bodhisattva’s kind nurturing of living beings and the multitudes he saved through his giving and he saw how such lofty merit and virtue was esteemed everywhere throughout the Ten Directions. Fearing his position would be usurped he conjured up an earth-prison before the Bodhisattva and said, “If you save multitudes by giving, then at the end of your life your spirit will enter the earth-prisons of Mount Tai, where you will broil and be subjected to ten thousand torments. Knowing that giving will bring you such hardship will you still do it with kindness?”
The Bodhisattva replied: “How could kind giving result in consignment to the earth-prisons of Mount Tai?”
Śakra said, “If you don’t believe me, ask the offenders!”
So the Bodhisattva asked a denizen, “Why were you consigned to the earth-prisons?”
The miscreant replied, “In the past when I dwelt in the world of men, I emptied the family coffers to save others from hardship, and now I receive serious punishments in Mount Tai’s prisons.”
The Bodhisattva asked, “If benevolence results in misfortune, what happens to the recipients?”
Śakra said, “They ascend to the Heavens at the end of their lives.”
The Bodhisattva responded, “My only motive is to bring relief to living beings; even if it is as you say, I sincerely vow to continue. Even if compassion brings punishment, I will certainly carry on. Endangering oneself to save others is the bodhisattva’s highest goal.” 
Śakra said, “But why do you still aspire to such lofty conduct?”
The Bodhisattva explained, “I seek buddhahood. I want to raise up and save all living beings so they obtain nirvana and so forever escape birth and death (saṃsāra).”
Śakra, on hearing of this sagely motivation, touched his head to the ground in obeisance saying, “In truth it is not the case that giving and compassionately saving living beings means forsaking good fortune and receiving the calamity of consignment to the prisons of Mount Tai. Your virtue moves the Heavens and the Earth, and fearful you would usurp my position, I showed you the earth-prisons to confound your resolve. I attempted to deceive a sage, please forgive this serious error.”
Then he repented of his transgression, bowed his head and left.

"《六度集經》卷1：「（二）「昔者菩薩為大國王，號薩[15]波達，布施眾生恣其所索，愍濟厄難常有悲愴。天帝釋覩王慈惠德被十方，天神鬼龍僉然而曰：『天帝尊位初無常人，戒具行高慈惠福隆，命盡神遷則為天[16]帝。』懼奪己位，欲往試之，以照真偽。帝命邊王曰：『今彼人王，慈潤霶霈福德巍巍，恐[17]于志求奪吾帝位。爾化為鴿，疾之王所，佯恐怖，求哀彼王。[18]彼王仁惠，必受爾歸；吾當尋後從王索爾。王終不還，必當市肉，以當其處。吾詭不止，王意清真，許終不違，會自割身肉以當其重也。若其秤肉隨而自重，肉盡身痛其必悔矣。意有悔者，所志不成。』「釋即化為鷹，邊王化為鴿。鴿疾飛趣于王足下，恐怖而云：『大王哀[19]我！吾命窮矣！』王曰：『莫恐莫恐！吾今活汝。』鷹尋後至，向王說曰：『吾鴿爾來，鴿是吾食，願王相還。』王曰：『鴿來以命相歸，已受其歸，吾言守信，終始無違。爾苟得[20]肉，吾自足爾，令重百倍。』鷹曰：『[21]吾唯欲鴿，不用餘肉，希王當相惠。而奪吾食乎？』王曰：『[22]已受彼歸，信重天地，何心違之乎？當以何物令[23]汝置鴿歡喜去矣？』鷹曰：『若王慈惠必[24]濟眾生者，割王肌肉令與鴿等，吾欣而受[25]之。』王曰：『大善！』即自割髀肉秤之令與鴿重等；鴿踰自重，自割如斯，身肉都盡未與重等，身瘡之痛其為無量。王以慈忍心願鴿活，又命近臣曰：『爾疾殺我，秤髓令與鴿重等。吾奉諸佛，受正真之重戒，濟眾生之危厄，雖有眾邪之惱，猶若微風，焉能動[26]太山乎？』「鷹照王懷守道不移，慈惠難齊，各復本身。帝釋、邊王稽首于地曰：『大王！欲何志尚，惱苦若茲？』人王曰：『吾不志天帝釋及飛行皇帝之位，吾覩眾生沒于盲冥，不覩三尊、不聞佛教，恣心于凶禍之行，投身于無擇之獄。覩斯愚惑，為之惻愴。誓願求佛，拔濟眾生之困厄，令得泥洹。』天帝驚曰：『愚謂大王欲奪吾位，[27]故相擾耳。將何勅誨？』王曰：『使吾身瘡[28]愈復如舊，令吾志尚布施濟眾行高踰今。』天帝即使天醫神藥，傳身瘡愈、色力踰前，身瘡斯須[29]豁然都愈。釋却稽首，遶王三匝歡喜而去。自是之後，布施踰前。菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」」(CBETA 2022.Q4, T03, no. 152, p. 1b12-c25)[15] 波【大】，婆【宋】【元】【明】。　[16] 帝【大】，帝釋【宋】【元】【明】。　[17] 于【大】，子【宋】【元】【明】。　[18] 彼王【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】。　[19] 我【大】，哉【宋】【元】【明】。　[20] 肉【大】，食【明】。　[21] 吾唯…王【大】，惟欲得鴿不以餘肉王豈【元】【明】，惟欲得鴿不以餘肉王希【宋】。　[22] 已受彼【大】，受彼自【宋】【元】【明】。　[23] 汝【大】，爾【宋】【元】【明】。　[24] 濟【大】，哀【宋】【元】【明】。　[25] 之【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】。　[26] 太【大】，大【元】【明】。　[27] 故【大】，是以【宋】【元】【明】。　[28] 愈【大】，瘳【宋】【元】【明】。　[29] 豁【大】，霍【宋】【元】【明】。","In former times the Bodhisattva was the ruler of a great kingdom. His name was Saboda (薩波達) and he gave to all living beings, indulging them with whatever they sought. He relieved those in distress, always deeply grieved by their plight. The King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), observed the King’s compassion, his virtue encompassing the Ten Directions. The heavenly beings (devas), ghosts, and dragons (nāgas) all agreed and said, “The position of King of the Gods is certainly not permanently vested in the incumbent. Should there be one who keeps all the rules, maintains lofty conduct, and whose compassion has generated great merit, on reaching the end of his life he may become Lord of the Heaven.”
Fearful that he would be stripped of his position Śakra wanted to go and test the King and determine whether he was sincere or a fake. He issued orders to a neighbouring god saying, “Now this person who is regarded as sovereign by the people, has compassion that enriches all like a heavy rainfall, and his moral conduct is lofty. I fear his ambition is to usurp my position as ruler. Transform yourself into a pigeon, and swiftly proceed to the King’s abode and feigning terror throw yourself on the King’s mercy. The King will look kindly upon you and will certainly give refuge. I will follow right behind and demand you back from the King. The King, ultimately, will refuse to return you but he will certainly offer to buy flesh in the market to take your place. I will pretend that that won’t do, and if the King’s intentions are pure and sincere, he will agree and ultimately will not renege on his promise to protect you. He will slice off your weight in his own flesh as a substitute for you. As he weighs his flesh, you can make yourself heavier. When his flesh is used up, he will be in agony and will certainly regret this course of action. Once he has regrets, his ambition cannot be fulfilled!”
Śakra then transformed into a hawk and the neighbouring king transformed into a pigeon. The pigeon flew speedily to the feet of the king and feigning terror, said, “Great Monarch! Take pity on me! My life is about to end!”
The King said, “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid! I will ensure your survival!”
The hawk arrived straight afterwards and said to the King, “My pigeon came to you. That pigeon is my dinner and I want Your Majesty to return him.”
The King said, “That pigeon came seeking refuge in fear of his life and I have already assured him a safe refuge. I have given my word and will never violate my promise. If you want flesh, I will personally see to it that you have one hundred times the weight of this pigeon.”
The hawk said, “Only pigeon will do! I have no use for any other kind of flesh! I hope Your Majesty will hand him over so I can take my meal!”
The King said, “I have already granted him refuge, and my pledge is more weighty than Heaven and Earth! How could I have the heart to violate it? Now what can I give you so will you relinquish the pigeon and leave satisfied?”
The hawk said, “If Your Majesty is compassionate and truly seeks to save living beings, were you to slice off your flesh and give me the equivalent of the pigeon, then I would be pleased to accept it.”
The King replied, “Very good!”
Straight away he began to slice off flesh from his thigh, weighing it with a view to equalling the weight of the pigeon, but as the pigeon made himself heavier, he kept slicing flesh from himself like this and, in the end, there was none left. Yet it still did not equal the weight of the pigeon. The agony of his wounds was beyond measure. The King in his compassionate forbearance wanted the pigeon to live so he ordered his courtiers saying,
“Quickly kill me, measure my marrow and equal the weight of the pigeon. I serve the Buddha and I have accepted the weighty rules of the correct and true teachings and the dangers attendant on the saving of living beings. Although there are difficulties caused by all sorts of evils, they affect me like a gentle breeze; how could such move Mount Tai?”
The hawk realised the King held fast to the Way; he was immovable, his compassion difficult to match. Hawk and pigeon each returned to his original form. Śakra and the neighbouring king knelt and touched their heads to the floor and said, “Great King! We want to know what ambition causes you to bear such torments as these?”
The human king said, “I do not aspire to the status of Śakra, King of the Gods, or that of a Flying Emperor (cakravartin). I observe living beings, mired in darkness and ignorance; neither seeing the Three Honoured Ones nor hearing the Buddhas’ teachings, wilfully indulging in catastrophic conduct, casting themselves into the inescapable prison. I see the foolish and deluded and I grieve for them. I vowed to seek buddhahood to alleviate the difficulties of living beings and cause them to attain nirvāṇa.”
Śakra, alarmed, said, “In my stupidity I thought your Great Majesty wanted to usurp my position and this is why I gave you such trouble. Please explain what I can do to make to make amends.”
The King said, “Heal my wounds and restore my body enable my resolve to give and save living beings to surpass its current state.”
Śakra immediately dispatched a heavenly doctor with his divine medicine to treat his wounds and his strength soon surpassed what it had been previously. Very quickly his wounds were completely healed. Śakra immediately touched his head to the ground in respect and circumambulated the King three times and left happily. From this time on, the King’s giving surpassed the levels reached previously.

"《六度集經》卷1：「（三）「昔者菩薩貧窶尤困，與諸商人俱之他國，其眾皆有信佛之志，布施窮乏濟度眾生。等人僉曰：『眾皆慈惠，爾將何施？』答曰：『夫身假借之類靡不棄捐，吾覩海魚，巨細相吞，心為[1]愴愴。吾當以身代其小者，令得須臾之命也。』即自投海。[2]海大魚飽，小者得活。魂靈化為鱣魚之王，身[3]有里數。「海邊有國，其國枯旱，黎庶飢饉更相吞噉。魚為流淚曰：『眾生擾擾，其苦痛哉？吾身有[4]里數之肉，可供黎民旬月之乏。』即自[5]盪身上于國渚，舉國噉之以存生命，輦肉數月而魚猶生。天神下曰：『爾為忍苦，其可堪[6]哉？何不放壽，可離斯痛也？』魚曰：『吾自絕命神逝身腐，民後飢饉將復相噉，吾不忍覩。』心為其感矣，天曰：『菩薩懷慈難齊。』天為傷心[7]曰：『爾必得佛，度[8]吾眾生矣。』「有人以斧斫取其首，魚時死矣。魂靈即感為王太子。生有上聖之明，四恩弘慈，潤齊二儀。愍民困窮，言之哽[9]咽。然國尚旱，[＊]靖心[10]齊肅，退食絕獻，頓首悔過曰：『民之不善，咎在我身，願喪吾命惠民雨澤。』日[11]日哀慟，猶至孝之子遭聖父之喪矣。精誠達遠，即[12]有各佛五百人來之其國界。「王聞心喜，悅若無身，奉迎稽首，請歸正殿。皇后、太子靡不肅虔，最味法服供足所乏，五體投地稽首叩頭，涕泣而曰：『吾心穢行濁，不合三尊四恩之教，苦酷人民，罪當伐己。流被下劣，枯旱累載，黎庶飢饉怨痛傷情。願除民灾，以禍罪我。』諸[13]各佛曰：『爾為仁君，慈惻仁惠，德齊帝釋，諸佛普知。今授汝福，慎無慼也。便疾勅民，皆令種穀。』王即如命，男女就業，家無不修，稻化為蓏，農臣以聞。王曰：『須熟。』蓏實覆國，皆含稻穬，中容數斛，其[14]味苾芬，香聞一國；舉國欣懌，歎詠王德。四境讎國皆稱臣妾，黎民雲集，國界日長。率土持戒，歸命三尊，王及臣民壽終之後，皆生天上。」佛言：「時貧人者，吾身是也。累劫仁惠拯濟眾生，功不徒朽，今果得佛，號天中天，為三界雄。菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」」(CBETA 2022.Q4, T03, no. 152, pp. 1c26-2b8)[1] 愴【大】，惻【宋】【元】【明】。　[2] 海【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】。　[3] 有里數【大】，長數里【元】【明】。　[4] 里數【大】，數里【元】【明】。　[5] 盪【大】，蕩【宋】【元】【明】。　[6] 哉【大】，乎【宋】【元】【明】。　[7] 曰【大】，〔－〕【宋】。　[8] 吾【大】，苦【宋】【元】【明】。　[9] 咽【大】＊，噎【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊。　[＊8-1] 靖【大】＊，靜【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊。　[10] 齊【大】，齋【宋】【元】【明】。　[11] 日【大】，月【宋】【元】【明】。　[12] 有各【大】，各有【宋】【元】【明】。　[13] 各【大】，咎【宋】【元】【明】。　[14] 味【大】，米【宋】【元】【明】。","In former times the Bodhisattva was impoverished and facing exceptional difficulties. He joined a group of merchants travelling to another kingdom all of whom had resolved to place their trust in the Buddha and donate to the poor and give succour to all living beings. They said, “Each one of our group has been charitable, what will you be donating?”
He replied, “This body is but on loan; it can be discarded. I have observed fish in the sea, big and small, eating one another, and I feel sorely grieved. I will use my body as substitute for the small fish and allow them a moment of life.”
With that, he threw himself into the sea. The big fish gorged on him and the small fish got to live on. His spirit transferred into an enormous sturgeon more than a mile long. By the seaboard was a kingdom suffering severe drought. The common folk were starving and had begun to eat one another.
The fish wept for them, saying, “Living beings are running amok in their terrible suffering! My body is more than a mile of flesh; I could supply the common folk an entire months’ worth of the food they lack.”
So right then he beached himself on the shore of the kingdom. The entire populace fed off him and their lives were saved. Cartloads of his flesh were taken over several months, yet the fish lived on. A deity (deva) descended and said, “You suffer for them with such forbearance, how can you stand it? Why don’t you relinquish life and put an end this agony?”
The fish said, “If I were to end my own life my spirit would leave and my body would rot. The people would start eating one another again; I can’t bear to think about it!”
Moved, the deity declared, “The compassion of the Bodhisattva is difficult to match!”
 Grieving for him, the deity continued, “You will certainly attain buddhahood and save living beings from suffering.”[1]
The time came when someone chopped his head off with an axe and the fish died. His spirit immediately moved and become a royal prince. From birth, he possessed the utmost sagely wisdom; through the Four Kindnesses [2] he broadened his compassion, enriching equally the Two Powers [3]. His sympathy for the people’s difficulties was extreme and he spoke of them, sobbing.
When he ascended to the throne the kingdom was still plagued with drought. He settled his mind and fasted, sending back food and refusing anything offered. Bowing his head to the ground in repentance, he said, “The blame for shortcomings of my people rests with me. I vow to renounce my life so the people will be favoured with rain.”
Day after day he was grief-stricken, like the most filial son mourning the death of his sagely father. His sincerity was so far-reaching that soon five hundred independent Buddhas (pratyekabuddhas) arrived at the boundaries of his kingdom. When the king heard this his heart was joyful, as happy as if he had no body. He respectfully welcomed them kneeling and touching his head to the ground and invited them into the main hall of the palace. The queen and the crown prince were solemn and respectful, giving them the tastiest fare, robes, and whatever else they lacked. The King threw himself to the floor and touched the ground with his forehead and with tears flowing said, “My thoughts are sullied and my conduct impure. I have failed to conform with the teachings of the Four Kindnesses of the Three Honoured Ones. The bitter suffering of the people is a crime for which I should be punished, yet it has spread to the lowest; the drought has continued for years, the common folk are starving and I grieve, sick at heart. I vow to eradicate the people’s suffering taking the blame for their ill-fortune on myself.”
All the independent Buddhas said, “You are a humane ruler, benevolent and compassionate, in virtue the equal of Lord Śakra, and the Buddhas know this. Now we will confer blessings on you - you must not worry. Issue an order compelling the people to plant grain immediately!”
The King promptly did as he was ordered. Men and women got to work and not one household did not do as they were told. The agricultural officials reported the rice had transformed into squash. The King declared, “They must be left to ripen.”
The squash covered the kingdom and they each contained several pecks of rice and barley. Their flavour was fragrant and their perfume permeated the kingdom; the entire kingdom was elated and praised the King’s virtue. All the neighbouring enemy kingdoms declared themselves vassals and servants of the King. The common folk converged on the kingdom in droves and its boundaries expanded daily. The lands within these borders upheld the Buddhas’ rules and surrendered their lives to the Three Honoured Ones. The King and his officials and people were all born in the Heavens after the end of their lives.
  The Buddha said, “At that time the impoverished man was me. The merit earned over many kalpas of benevolently saving beings simply does not decay and now I have obtained the fruits of Buddhahood, called God among Gods, the Hero of the Three Realms.”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.

Eating fruits and drinking water, he stored not the slightest surplus. He thought compassionately about the harms living beings inflicted on themselves through ignorance and stupidity; seeing any creature in dangerous or difficult circumstances he would risk his life to save it.
When searching for fruits he encountered a tigress feeding her cubs. Feeding over, tired and lacking food, she was crazed with hunger and about to turn and eat her children. The Bodhisattva observed this and, sorrowful, was deeply moved. His pity for living beings, born in this world of care and suffering, was beyond measure and his anguish for a mother eating her child was difficult put into words. He choked with sobs as tears flowed. He turned and searched for something to feed the tiger and so save the cubs’ lives, but there was nothing to be seen anywhere. He thought to himself, “Tigers are flesh-eating animals,” and considering this deeply said, “My established ambition is to study the Way. If I were to die for living beings mired in extreme suffering desirous of saving them, I would rid myself of the calamity that is life and gain eternal peace. When I get old, I will die anyway and my body will be discarded. It would be better to give it compassionately to save the multitude and so perfect my virtue.”
Thereupon he placed his head in the mouth of the tigress, hoping that by doing so he would die swiftly without experiencing any pain. The tigers, mother and cubs, were all kept safe.
All the Buddhas sighed at his virtue, equating his merit with that of the consummate sages. Among the heavenly beings (devas), dragons (nāgas), good divinities and those possessed of an ambition to attain the Way, none were not moved and advanced, some became stream-entrants, others once-returners, non-returners, arhats, or ones Awakened to Causation Alone (pratyekabuddhas), and there were those who gave rise to the aspiration for supreme, perfect awakening.
By his fierce resolve, the Bodhisattva overtook all other Bodhisattvas by nine kalpas, vowing to be born in the Age of the Fivefold Impurities as the Teacher of Gods and Men to save defiant evildoers and cause those in error to follow the Way.

The kingdom was called Ganyi (乾夷), and the king’s name was Pianyue (偏悅), ‘Inclined to Happiness’; he was inwardly wise, outwardly humane, his countenance agreeable and his demeanour impartial. The common folk had fallen under his transformative influence and prisons were without inmates. When the common folk were in need, he gave them what they wanted; his compassion enriched all, his kindness like that of Śakra.
A brahmin from another kingdom admired the King’s humane giving, supplying whatever the multitude desired. Yet as the wicked and jealous seek to destroy the true by means of the false, he approached the palace gates and said, “I have heard your sagacious ruler saves the common folk from their difficulties, akin to Heaven’s all-encompassing bounty.”
He asked the guard, “Can you report my arrival?”
The courtiers heard of this and the King immediately appeared.
The brahmin explained, “Your Sagacious Majesty’s humane grace has covered kingdoms in the four directions; of those who know of him none do not gasp in admiration. I dare to bring my desire to your attention.”
The King said, “Very good!”
The brahmin said, “Your Heavenly Majesty values giving; supplicants are never refused. There is a particular matter for which I need a person’s head, and I wish to request the royal head to assist my aspiration.”
The King said, “What’s so good about my head that you want it so much? I have a multitude of treasures you could benefit from were I to give them to you.”
The brahmin would not accept any alternative, so the King commissioned a craftsman to make a head encrusted with the several hundred of each of the Seven Treasures and presented it to the brahmin.
The brahmin refused it said, “Only Your Majesty’s head will do!”
The King, who had never refused anyone anything, immediately left the royal hall, tied himself to a tree with his hair, and said, “I present you my head.”
The brahmin drew his blade and advanced swiftly, but the tree spirit saw him and enraged at his immoral conduct slapped his cheek. His body immediately spun round till he faced in the opposite direction; his hand fell and he dropped his knife.
The King continued to reign in peace and prosperity. His officials and subjects wished him long life, their sadness and happiness shared. The gods sighed at his virtue saying, “This is giving from the heart!”
The Four Kings of Heaven defended and protected him and multitudinous poisons were eliminated and within the borders of his realm there was no sickness. The five grains flourished, jails were torn down, and ruler and people prospered.
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “At that time the ruler of the kingdom of Ganyi was me, and the brahmin was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this."
"《六度集經》卷1：「（六）「昔者菩薩為大國王，理民以慈，恕[A1]己度彼，[25]月月巡行貧乏，拔濟鰥寡、疾藥糜粥。每出巡狩，[26]則命後車具載眾寶衣被醫藥，死者葬之。每覩貧民輙自咎責：『君貧德，民窮矣；君富德，民家足。今民貧，則吾貧矣。』王慈若斯，名被十方。「第二帝釋坐為其熱，釋心即懼曰：『彼德巍巍，必奪吾位。吾壞其志，行即畢乎！』便自變化為老梵志，從王乞銀錢一千，王即惠之。曰：『[27]吾西[28]𥥧，恐人盜之。願以寄王。』王曰：『吾國無盜。』重曰：『寄王。』王即受之。「[1]天又化為梵志詣宮門，近臣以聞，王即現之。梵志歎曰：『大王功名流布八極，德行希有。今故遠來，欲有所乞。』王曰：『甚善！』曰：『吾宿薄祐生在凡庶，欣慕尊榮，欲乞斯國。』王曰：『大善！』即與妻子，[2]輙輕乘而去。「天帝復化為梵志，從王乞車；以車馬惠之。與妻子進路，依山止宿。有五通道士與王為友，[3]侻憶王德[4]仰視其宿，覩之失國，[＊]靖心禪息，覩天帝釋，貪嫉奪國委頓[5]疲疵。道士以神足忽然之王所，曰：『將欲何求，勞志若茲？』曰：『吾志所存，子具知之。』道士即化為一轅之車，以送王還，晨各離矣。「天化為梵志復乞其車，即[6]復惠之。轉進未至彼國數十里，天復化為前梵志來索銀錢。王曰：『吾以國惠人，[7]侻忘子錢。』梵志[8]曰：『三日必還吾錢。』王即以妻子各質一家，得銀錢一千以還梵志。妻侍質家女，女浴脫身珠璣眾寶以懸著架，天化為鷹撮衣寶去。女云：『[9]婢盜！』錄之繫獄。其兒與質家兒俱臥，天夜往殺質家兒矣。死家取兒付獄，母子[10]俱繫，飢[11]饉毀形，呼嗟無救，[12]吟泣終日，罪成棄市。「王賃得銀錢一千，行贖妻、子，歷市覩之，即存念十方諸佛，自悔過曰：『吾宿命惡乃致茲乎！』[＊]靖心入禪，神通之明覩天所為。空中有聲曰：『何不急殺之乎？』王曰：『吾聞，帝釋普濟眾生，赤心惻愴，育過慈母，含血之類莫不蒙祐，爾為無惡緣獲帝位乎？』釋懷重毒惡熟罪成，生入太山；天人龍鬼莫不稱善。「地主之王，即釋妻、子之罪。二王相見，尋問其[13]原，具陳所由，國無巨細靡不墮淚。地主之王分國而治；故國臣民尋王所在，率土奉迎。二國君民，一哀一喜。「時王者，吾身是。妻者，俱夷是。子者，羅[14]云是。天帝[15]者，調達是。山中梵志，舍利弗是。彼國王者，彌勒是。菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」」(CBETA 2022.Q4, T03, no. 152, pp. 2c21-3b8)[A1] 己【CB】，已【大】(cf.

Each month he would make a tour to monitor the condition of the poor and needy. He would assist widowers, widows and the sick, providing medicine and millet gruel. Each time he set out on such a tour he would order that the attending carts all be loaded with a multitude of jewels, clothing, bedding and medicaments. Any dead were buried. Whenever he observed a poor person he would invariably reproach himself: “If their lord is of impoverished virtue, the people will live in penury; if their lord has abundant virtue, the people will have a sufficiency. If my people are impoverished, it is my impoverished virtue to blame.”
 The reputation of the King for such compassion was known throughout the Ten Directions and this made the throne of Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), the sovereign of the Second Heaven [1], grow hot and Śakra became fearful, saying, “One of such lofty virtue will surely usurp my position. If I destroy his resolve this will stop him!”
So he transformed himself into an aged brahmin and asked for 1000 silver coins which the king gave him immediately. Śakra then asked, “I am old and infirm and I am fearful someone will steal these. Might I entrust them to Your Majesty?”
The King replied, “But there are no thieves in my kingdom!” 
Śakra repeated his request, “Might I entrust them to Your Majesty?”
The King then agreed. Śakra transformed into another brahmin and went to the door of the palace. The courtiers informed the King who granted him an audience. This brahmin sighed admiringly, “Fame of your Great Majesty’s achievements has spread to the Eight Extremities - such virtuous conduct is so rare! Now the reason I have come from afar is there is something I wish to ask of you.”
The King said, “Excellent!”
Śakra explained, “In the past I have received scant blessings and have been born among the common folk. I have admired and envied rank and glory and I wish to request you give me this kingdom.”
The King said, “Very good!”
He departed immediately in a light carriage with his wife and son. The King of the Gods, Śakra yet again transformed into a brahmin and requested the carriage from the King who gave him the carriage and the horses. With his wife and son he continued his journey and stopped hard by a mountain to spend the night. There was an ascetic possessed of the Five Supernatural Penetrations (abhijñā),  a friend of the king, who recalled his virtue with pleasure, looked up and observed the lunar lodge which governed the King’s fate and perceived he had lost his kingdom. He stilled his mind with dhyāna and breathing and observed the King of the Gods Śakra with envious greed take the kingdom, and the King exhausted and unwell. The ascetic used his supernatural power to travel anywhere at will to go immediately to the King’s side, and said, “What do you want to achieve, labouring so hard in this way?”
The King said, “You know all about my ambitions!”
The adept conjured up a one-shaft cart for him to use for his return. In the morning, each went their separate ways.
Śakra transformed into a brahmin and once again requested the King’s cart which he gave him immediately. The King turned around and proceed on his way. He was still a few dozen miles from his destination when Śakra once again transformed into the first brahmin and came to demand the return of his silver. The King said, “I have favoured another with my kingdom. I’m afraid I simply forgot about your money.”
The brahmin said, “I’ll give you three days then I demand you return my money.”
So the King used his wife and his son as collateral with different families and gave the 1000 pieces of silver cash he had raised back to the brahmin.
The King’s wife waited on the woman of the family who had taken her as collateral. The woman was bathing and took off her many jewels and hung them on a rack. Śakra transformed into a hawk and snatched away her clothes and jewels. The woman shrieked, “My servant is a thief!”
The King’s wife was arrested and imprisoned.
The King’s son slept in the same room as the son of the family who had accepted him as collateral. Śakra came during the night and killed him. The family of the deceased grabbed the King’s son and he was committed to prison. Mother and son were bound together. Starving, their bodies were in a state of collapse. They cried out sorrowfully, but no one came to their rescue. They wept all day as their punishment was soon to end with execution in the marketplace.
The King had earned 1000 pieces of silver and was on his way to redeem his wife and son when passing through the marketplace he saw them. Immediately he concentrated his mind on the Buddhas of the Ten Directions, and repenting his transgressions, said, “In former lives I did evil deeds so it has come to this!”
He stilled his mind and entered dhyāna. With the clarity of supernatural penetration he observed what the god was doing. Then from mid-air came a voice suggesting, “Why not kill him right now?”
The King replied, “I have heard that Śakra is the universal saviour of sentient beings. For those whose sincere heart is grieved, his nurturing surpasses that of a loving mother; for those beings within whom blood flows, all fall under his protection. He acted without evil intent imagining I wanted to usurp his position!”
Śakra had harboured serious evil intent, and when his wickedness ripened his punishment culminated in his entering the earth prisons of Mount Tai while still living; gods, men, dragons and ghosts, none did not agree this was appropriate.
The ruler of the kingdom in which these events took place immediately pardoned the wife and son of their crimes. The King met with this ruler and each enquired after the other’s origins, and the King explained everything. In that kingdom there were none, high ranking or low, who did not weep. The ruler divided his state and they each governed a part. The officials and common folk of the King’s original domain sought out their King and were welcomed. The ruler and the peoples of the two kingdoms were united in mourning and united in joy.
             “At that time, the King was I, the wife was Gopikā (Yaśodharā; Juyi 俱夷) and the son was Rāhula (Luoyun 羅云). The King of the Gods, Śakra was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達); the brahmin in the mountains was Śāriputra (Shelifu 舍利弗). The king of the other kingdom was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒).”

He governed the people with rectitude and was totally impartial. However, he neglected to undertake regular tours of inspection. The Chief Minister petitioned saying, “It is my hope that you will undertake a tour of your domain.”
The king said, “Very good!”
The next day he set out promptly. Has people appeared happy, everyone having obtained an appropriate position. The King observed the exquisite elegance of the residences of the rich clans of the kingdom; their roofs tiled with gold and silver, their apparel and adornments illuminating the roadways. Overjoyed, he declared, “My kingdom is really rich!”
On his return to his palace he had a chance to think about this, and asked himself, “How do these wealthy households benefit my kingdom?”
He decreed a levy be raised against their wealth to fund supplies for the army. One such wealthy householder, with a private fortune of thirty million, gave a scanty offering when at an audience with the King. The King raged, “How dare you cheat me to my face?”
He replied, “I have always governed my own affairs and have amassed a personal fortune. Those precious things in my residence, are the share of the Five Classes of Threat. They do not belong to me.”
The King asked, “Then what do mean by ‘personal fortune’?”
He replied, “I keep in mind the enterprise of the Buddha, tell others of the teachings of the Buddha and perform the practice of the Buddha. I donate the portion of the Five Classes to support Buddha temples, and respectfully serve the worthy assembly of monks offering them clothing and food. I compassionately nurture things that fly, wriggle and crawl; whatever causes disquiet, I do not exacerbate, and so good fortune follows me wherever I go as shadow follows form. That is what I mean by ‘personal fortune’. The share of the Five Classes is that taken by water, fire, robbers, officials and death. My body and the family fortune will be left in the world and at the end, I will depart alone. I do not yet know where the gates to disaster and good fortune are located, but I look on the world as an illusion so for this reason I dare not lay claim to any of it. The share of the Five Classes is around a billion, this is an incubator of calamity. I am in constant fear of endangering myself; how could I dare to lay claim to it? I beg you to have some of your men cart it away and so rid me of my troubles.”
The King said, “Indeed, you speak the truth.”
He was promptly dismissed and left. The King retired to his practice room, settled his mind and concentrated his thoughts, and immediately awoke to reality. He exclaimed, “I cannot even protect myself! How could I ever hope to protect my territory or my wives and children for any length of time?”
Without delay he collected and recorded the Buddha's scriptures, reciting them and commenting on their meaning. The impurities of his mind were examined and eliminated. He advanced faithful officials and accepted loyal admonishment. He declared an amnesty throughout the kingdom and returned the peoples’ valuables. With the ranks of officials he deliberated on generosity and rectitude, saying, “Those who do not observe the profound import of the Buddha's scriptures and give weight to the precepts are deaf and blind! That wealthy householder is rich; it is me who was impoverished!”
Then he ordered his wealth be distributed throughout the kingdom, relieving the poor and needy, giving them whatever they desired, establishing Buddhist monasteries, hanging silk banners and burning incense, feeding śramaṇas and observing the six fast days himself.
It was like this for three years. Within his boundaries all was peaceful, banditry ceased, the five grains ripened, and the people were neither hungry nor cold. When the King died at the end of a long life, he was immediately born in the Second Heaven of the Realm of Desire [1].
  The Buddha told all the śramaṇas: “At that time the king was me, the wealthy householder was Śāriputra (Qiuliuzi 秋鷺子). The one urging the king to inspect his kingdom was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難).”

"《六度集經》卷1：「（八）「昔者菩薩為大理家，名曰仙歎，財富無數。覩佛明典，覺世無常，榮命難保，財非己有，[＊]唯有布施功德不朽。令告黎民：『若有貧乏，恣願取之。』如斯數月。時，[26]政寬民[27]富無[28]財乏者。仙歎念曰：『惟[29]當市藥，供護眾疾耳。』即市良藥濟眾生命，慈育普至，恩無不周。累年之惠，德香遠熏，四方病者馳來，首尾歎其弘潤，以德配天。「財賄都盡身行採寶，去家百餘里，於一水上逢數乘車載重病者，曰：『爾所之乎？』答曰：『之仙歎所，庶全餘命。』仙歎即還，從王貸金五百兩，市藥以[30]療，病者悉瘳。自與商人入海採寶，所獲弘多。還國置舟步行，道乏無水，仙歎得一井水，呼[31]等人汲之，却自取飲。商人覩其所得白珠，光耀絕眾，貪為[32]尤惡，毀聖殘仁，共排仙歎投之于井。菩薩仁德感神動祇，天神接承令不毀傷。「商人還國，王曰：『仙歎何之？』對曰：『去國即別，不知所之。』曰：『爾乃殺之乎！』曰：『不也。』「仙歎[1]於井覩空傍穴，尋之而進出彼家井，[2]准七[3]日行得其本國。王曰：『何緣空還乎？』對曰：『不遇。』王[＊]靖思曰：『其必有以[4]乎！』召商人問：『爾誠首之即活，欺者死矣。』即皆首之，[5]付獄定罪。仙歎涕泣，馳詣宮門叩頭請罪。王曰：『違政也。』又重請曰：『愚者倒見，未足明責。原其無知也。』王嘉仙歎之仁覆，原商人之凶罪，勅令還物。商人僉曰：『仙歎不奉佛者，豈有斯仁乎？』各擇名寶以還之矣。仙歎各受其半，商人叩頭曰：『蒙祐命全，願盡納焉。』於斯受之，以還王金，又大布施。王逮臣民，相率受戒，子孝臣忠，天神[6]榮衛，國豐民康，四境服德，靡不稱善。」佛言：「時仙歎者，是我身也。菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」」(CBETA 2022.Q4, T03, no. 152, pp. 3c12-4a16)[＊14-3] 唯【大】＊，惟【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊。　[26] 政【大】，正【宋】。　[27] 富【大】，富足【元】【明】。　[28] 財乏【大】，乏財【宋】，取財【元】【明】。　[29] 當【大】，常【宋】。　[30] 療【大】，療彼病【宋】【元】【明】。　[31] 等【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】。　[32] 尤【大】，無【宋】，元【元】【明】。　[1] 於【大】，于【宋】【元】【明】。　[2] 准【大】，唯【元】【明】。　[3] 日【大】，日而【宋】【元】【明】。　[＊8-6] 靖【大】＊，靜【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊。　[4] 乎【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】。　[5] 付【大】，執【宋】【元】【明】。　[6] 榮【大】，營【宋】【元】【明】。","In former times the Bodhisattva was a very wealthy householder named Xiantan (仙歎), his riches incalculable. He paid close attention to the Buddha’s insightful texts and realised that the world was impermanent, that a flourishing life is difficult to preserve, that wealth is not one’s own, and that it is only the merit accrued from giving that does not decay. He ordered the common folk be told, “If you are in need, whatever it is you desire you will obtain it.”
This situation pertained for several months. But at that time, governance was lenient and the people prosperous; there were none who lacked means. Xiantan considered this and decided, “I should just buy medicine to supply and protect the sick.”
He promptly bought good medicine and saved the lives of living beings, compassionately nurturing all comers, none falling without his kind embrace. Year upon year of giving followed and the fragrance of his virtue perfumed far distant places. The sick of all four quarters of the world hastened to him and praised the vast reach of his nurturing and his virtue that matched that of the gods.
Once his wealth had been exhausted he set off to collect more precious things. Dozens of miles from home, by the shore, he came across several cartloads of seriously ill people. He asked them, “Where are you going?”
They replied, “To Xiantan’s place in the hope that we can be cured and live out the remainder of our lives in good health.”
Xiantan returned straight away, borrowed 500 ounces of gold from the King and bought medicine to treat them. The sick all recovered.
He went to sea with some merchants to gather precious items and collected a great quantity. Returning to the kingdom, they moored the boat and set out on foot. The route lacked any source of water, but Xiantan found a well and called on his companions to draw from it and they immediately helped themselves. But the merchants then caught sight of the white pearls he had found, their brilliant lustre surpassing any ordinary ones. Alas, greed is particularly evil; it is destructive of wisdom and is injurious to the humane. They ganged up on Xiantan and shoved him down the well. The Bodhisattva’s humane virtue moved the spirits of Heaven and Earth and the gods intervened to ensure he came to no harm.
When the merchants arrived back in the kingdom the King enquired, “Where is Xiantan?”
They replied, “Once we left the kingdom, we parted ways; we have no idea where he went.”
The King said, “You killed him, didn’t you?”
They responded, “We did no such thing!”
In the well, Xiantan observed an opening off the to the side, and investigating it he passed in and out through the wells of other households. In around seven days, he made it back to his own kingdom. The King asked him, “Why do you return empty handed?”
He replied, “I found nothing of worth.”
The King thought to himself, “He must have his reasons for staying quiet.”
He summoned the merchants and said, “If you sincerely admit your guilt, I will let you live; those who deceive me will be put to death!”
They all promptly admitted their guilt and were committed to prison convicted of their crimes. Xiantan wept and hurried to the gates of the palace and, prostrating himself, pleaded that the punishment fall on him. The King said, “That would offend against the rule of law!”
Once again, he begged, explaining, “The ignorant have distorted views — it is not enough to prove they were responsible! Please forgive their lack of understanding.”
The King praised Xiantan’s humane response and forgave the merchants’ evil crime, decreeing that they return the goods. The merchants all said, “Would Xiantan be this humane if he did not worship the Buddha?”
Each selected rare gems and handed them over to him. Xiantan only took half he was offered. The merchants prostrated themselves and said, “Thanks to your blessing our lives were saved. Please accept it all!”
He accepted it to repay the King’s loan and used the rest to make generous donations.
One after another the King, his officials and his subjects took the precepts. Children were filial and officials loyal, and the gods provided protection. The kingdom was wealthy and the people healthy. Bordering kingdoms submitted to this virtuous rule, none not full of praise.

"《六度集經》卷1：「（九）「昔者菩薩從四姓生，墮地即曰：『眾生萬禍，吾當濟焉。不覩佛儀，不聞明法，吾[7]當開其[8]耳目，除其盲聾，令之覩聞無上正真，眾聖之王、明範之[9]原也。布施誘進靡不服從矣。』九親驚曰：『古世之來未聞幼孩而為斯[10]云，將是天龍鬼神之靈乎！當卜之焉。』即答親曰：『吾為上聖之所化，懷普明之自然，非彼眾妖，慎無疑矣。』言畢即默。親曰：『兒有乾坤弘潤之志，將非凡夫乎！』名兒曰普施。「年有十歲，佛諸典籍、流俗眾術靡不貫綜，辭親濟眾布施貧乏。親曰：『吾有最[11]福之上名也，爾可恣意布施眾貧矣。』對曰：『不足。』乞作沙門：『賜[12]吾法服、應器、[13]策杖，以斯濟眾，即[14]吾生願也。』親憶兒始生之誓，無辭[15]禦焉，即從其願聽為沙門。「周[16]旋教化經一大國，國有豪姓，亦明眾書，覩普施儀容堂堂光華[17]韑曄，厥[18]性惔怕淨若天金，有上聖之表，將為世雄也。謂普施曰：『有欲相告，願足聖人，吾有陋女願給箕[A3]箒之使。』答曰：『大善！須吾還也。』即進路之海邊，附載度海，上岸入山，[19]到無人處，遙覩銀城宮殿明好。時，有毒蛇遶城七匝體大百圍，見普施來仰然舉首。普施念曰：『斯含毒類必有害心，吾當興無蓋之慈以消彼毒也。夫兇即火也，慈即水[20]矣，以水滅火，何[21]嘗不滅！』即坐興慈定，『願令眾生早離八難，心去惡念逢佛見法，與沙門會，得聞無上正真明道，心開垢滅，如吾所見也。』興斯慈定，蛇毒即滅垂首而眠。「普施登其首入城，城中有天神，覩普施來，欣豫而曰：『久服聖德，今來翔茲，[22]成吾本心也。願留一時九十日。』普施然許。天王即以[23]正事委付近臣，身自供饌，朝夕肅懷，稟受諸佛非常、苦、空、非身之高行，濟[24]眾之明法。時，日[25]食畢，普施進路，天王以明月真珠一枚送之[26]曰：『以珠自隨，明四十里。志願發[27]云，眾寶滿足。若後得佛，願為弟子親侍聖側。』普施曰可。「即復前行，覩黃金城，嚴飾踰銀，又有毒蛇圍城十四[28]匝，巨[29]軀倍前舉首數丈。普施復思弘慈之定，蛇毒即消垂首而眠。登之入城中，有天人，覩普施歡喜曰：『久服靈耀，翔茲甚善，願留二時百八十日，吾願盡養，惟留威神。』即然許之，留為說法無上明行，訖即辭退。天人復以神珠一枚送之，明耀八十里，志之所願，眾寶滿其里數。『若子得道，願為弟子，神足無上。』「受其神珠，即復進路，覩琉璃城，光耀踰前，又有毒蛇巨軀甚大，遶城二十一匝，仰首[30]瞋目當彼城門，復坐深思普慈之定，誓濟眾生，毒歇垂首。登之而入城中。[31]有天人喜辭猶前，『請留三時，願供所志。』期竟辭退，又送神珠一枚，明耀百六十里，珠之所在，眾寶尋從滿其明內，在志所欲無求不獲。『子若得無上正真覺道者，吾願為弟子，有最明之智。』曰：『必獲爾願。』普施得珠曰：『斯足以濟眾生之困乏。』[32]返其舊居。「海諸龍神僉會議曰：『吾等巨海，[＊]唯斯三珠為吾榮華。道士悉得，吾等何榮？寧都亡諸寶，不失斯珠。』海神化為凡人，當普施前立曰：『吾聞仁者獲世上寶，可得觀乎？』即以示之。神[33]搏其首即取其珠。普施惟曰：『吾歷險阻經跨巨海乃獲斯寶，欲以拯濟眾生困乏，反為斯神所見奪乎？』曰：『爾還吾珠，不者吾竭爾海。』海神答曰：『爾言何虛？斯之巨海，深廣難測，孰能盡之？天日可殞，巨風可却，海之難竭猶空難毀也。』「普施曰：『昔吾[34]錠光佛前願得道力，反覆眾海指擢須彌，震[35]動天地又移諸剎。佛從吾志與吾願，吾今得之。今爾鬼[36]𩲐糸髮之邪力，焉能遏吾正真之勢乎？』即說：經曰：『吾自無數劫來，飲母乳湩、啼哭之淚、身死血流，海所不受。恩愛難絕、生死難止，吾尚欲絕恩愛之本、止生死之神。今世抒之不盡，世世抒之。』[1]即住併兩足，瓢抒海水投鐵圍外。「有天名遍淨，遙聞之，深自惟曰：『昔吾於[＊]錠光佛前，聞斯人獲其志願，必為世尊度[2]吾眾生。』天[3]即下，助其抒水，十分去八。海神悔怖曰：『斯何人哉？而有無極之靈乎！斯水盡矣，吾居壞也。』即出眾寶空其諸藏以與普施。普施不受，曰：『[＊]唯欲得吾珠耳。』諸神[4]還其珠，普施返其水。「旋其本土，尋路布施，所過之國，國無貧民，處處諸[5]國無不改操[6]五戒十善[7]以為[8]國政，開獄大赦，潤逮眾生，遂至得佛。」佛告諸沙門：「普施[9]者，我身[10]是。父[11]者，白淨王是。母者，即吾母舍妙是。[12]道士女者，今俱夷是。時，銀城中天者，[13]今現阿難是。金城中天者，[14]目連是。琉璃城中天者，舍利弗是。菩薩累劫勤行四恩，誓願求佛，拯濟眾生。菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q1, T03, no. 152, pp. 4a17-5a19)[7] 當【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 耳【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 原【大】，源【宋】【元】【明】　[10] 云【大】，矣【宋】　[11] 福【大】，富【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 吾【大】，我【明】　[13] 策【大】，錫【宋】【元】【明】　[14] 吾【大】，吾仁【宋】　[15] 禦【大】，抑【元】【明】　[16] 旋【大】，遊【宋】【元】【明】　[17] 韑【大】，耀【宋】　[18] 性惔【大】，姓淡【宋】　[A3] [竺-二+帚]【CB】【麗-CB】，菷【大】(cf.

No sooner was he delivered did he declare, “Living beings face myriad misfortunes; I will bring succour to them. For those who have neither observed the Buddha’s comportment, nor heard his enlightening teachings, I will open their eyes and ears, curing their blindness and deafness, thus allow them to see and hear of the supreme perfection of the king among sages, the source of the model of enlightenment. My giving will provide the lead, and none will not follow.”
All his relations were shocked and said, “Since ancient times an infant has never been heard to speak like this; this must be the spirit of a god, a dragon or some other supernatural being! We should conduct a divination on this.”
He immediately responded to his relations, saying, “I have received the teachings of a Higher Sage, and have embraced the all-pervading radiance of the self-existent. I am no demon, have no doubts!”
He finished speaking and fell silent. His relations said, “The child has the ambition to greatly enrich the heavens and the earth; he will be no ordinary person.”
They named the child Pushi (普施 ‘Universal Giving’). By the time he was ten he had thoroughly mastered the Buddhist scriptures, customs and arts. He wanted to bid farewell to his family intending to save living beings by giving to those who were poor and in need.
His relations said, “We have the well-deserved reputation for being the most fortunate of families, you may give to the poor without restraint!”
He replied, “It is not enough. I beg that I be permitted to become a śramaṇa. Give me robes, a begging bowl and a bamboo staff. With these I can save the multitude and fulfil the oath I made at birth.”
His relations recalled the vow he made when he was first born and were unable to refuse him, and promptly acceded to his wish and allowed him to become a śramaṇa in accordance with his oath.
  Travelling around teaching and converting, he passed through a great kingdom. The kingdom had a wealthy householder who was also wise and well-read. He observed Pushi’s wonderful appearance, radiant and shining, his serene nature, pure like heavenly gold, that made him look like a Higher Sage destined to become a World Hero. He said to Pushi, “I have a request that I beg you to accept, Sagely One. I have a homely daughter and I’d like to give her to you to do your housework.”
He replied, “Very good! But this must await my return!”
Immediately, he set off to the seaboard, then travelled across the ocean. Coming ashore he entered the mountains and reached an uninhabited spot. In the distance he observed a silver city, its palaces and halls shining and beautiful. A venomous snake had wound itself around the city seven times, its body as thick as a huge tree trunk. It saw Pushi coming and raised its head, looking up. Pushi thought to himself: “Such a venomous beast surely has the intention to cause harm, I will generate unlimited kindness and thus destroy this poison. The baleful is ‘fire’, and kindness is ‘water’. Water extinguishes fire; whenever has this not eliminated the problem?”
He promptly sat and began meditating on kindness. “I vow to assist all beings swiftly avoid the Eight Difficulties and to cause their minds to dispel evil thoughts and bring about an encounter with a Buddha so they listen to the teachings, meet with śramaṇas, and get to hear of the enlightening Way of Supreme Perfection, and that they open their minds, their defilements are destroyed, and they see things as I do.”
He began this meditation on kindness and the snake’s venom was eliminated; he lowered his head and fell asleep. Pushi climbed onto his head and entered the city. In the city there was a deity who saw Pushi coming and said happily, “Long have we acknowledged the sagely virtue of the Buddha, now you have arrived we can perfect our original mind. We hope you will stay for a season, for ninety days.”
Pushi agreed. The deity king immediately used proper channels to entrust this matter to his courtiers, he himself offered him meals morning and night, respectfully looking after his needs. He accepted the teaching of the buddhas that the lofty practice of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self were the enlightening teachings that save all beings. One day, after the meal was finished, Pushi set off once again on his journey. The deity king saw him off with the gift of a pearl as bright as the moon, saying, “Carry this about your person, it illuminates a dozen square miles. It will satisfy your need for valuables to donate. If you later become a buddha, I want to be your disciple and attend the sage as a close relative.”
Pushi said, “You can.”
He recommenced his journey and soon observed a golden city, its magnificence surpassing that of the silver. Once again there was a venomous snake, this one encircling the city fourteen times, its gargantuan body twice the size of the previous one. It lifted its head to a height several times that of a man. Pushi once again turned his attention to meditating on wide-ranging kindness and the snake’s venom dissipated, he lowered his head and went to sleep. Pushi climbed up onto it and entered the city. A deity saw Pushi and exclaimed happily, “Long have we acknowledged the numinous brightness of the Buddha. Your arrival here is really wonderful. I hope you will stay for two seasons, for one hundred and eighty days. I yearn to well care for you, Powerful Spirit, and urge you to stay!”
 Pushi immediately assented to this request and remained to preach the teachings of the Buddha, the unsurpassed wisdom and practice. When finished, he took leave of his hosts. Again the deity saw him off with the gift of a divine pearl, whose brightness illuminated two dozen square miles saying, “Whatever it is you have set your mind on, treasures will fill this area. If you attain the Way, I want to be your disciple with spiritual powers unexcelled.”
 Pushi accepted the divine pearl and set off on his journey once again. He saw a city of beryl, its brilliance surpassing that of the previous cities. It also had a venomous snake of gargantuan proportions, this one wrapped around the city twenty-one times. It raised its head and glowered, in effect the gateway to this city. Once again Pushi sat and entered deeply into meditation on universal kindness, vowing to save living beings. The poison disappeared and the snake lowered its head. Pushi climbed upon it and entered the city. A deity happily greeted him as those before had done: “Please stay for three seasons. We will supply whatever you want.”
Once this period came to an end, he took leave of his hosts, and once again was given a divine pearl. Its brightness illuminated four dozen square miles. The deity told him,
“Wherever the pearl is, treasures of all kinds will search for and follow its bright inner light; whatever it is you desire you will obtain it. If you attain the Supreme, Perfect Awakening, I want to be your disciple with the most perspicacious wisdom.”
Pushi said, “I will certainly grant your request.”
Pushi took the pearls saying, “These will be sufficient for me to save living beings from their difficulties.”
Then he embarked on his journey home.
  The dragon deities of the ocean all met to discuss this situation, saying, “In our vast oceans, it is precisely these three pearls that make us glorious and magnificent. Now this ascetic has them all, how are we going to appear glorious? We would rather lose all our other precious possessions than lose those pearls!”
One of the sea deities transformed into an ordinary person and stood before Pushi and said, “I have heard that you, kind sir, have obtained the best jewels in the world, may I see them?”
Pushi showed them to him immediately and the deity beat him round the head and snatched the pearls. Pushi thought to himself: “I passed through dangers and difficulties crossing a vast ocean to get these jewels. I want to them to save living beings from difficulties, can I allow them to be snatched away by this deity?”
He said, “Give me back my pearls! If you do not, I will dry up your ocean!”
The sea deity said, “What vacuous talk! The depths and breadths of this vast ocean are difficult to plumb or measure, who could empty it? Could the sky and sun fall down? Could the great winds come to a standstill? It would be as hard to dry up the oceans as it would to destroy the void.”
Pushi said, “In the past I made a vow before Dīpaṃkara Buddha (Dingguang Fo 錠光佛) that I would strive to attain the power of the Way enabling me to upend the oceans and uproot Mount Sumeru (Xumi 須彌), to shake the heavens and the earth and move all the lands. The Buddha appreciated my resolve, granted me my wish and I have attained my goal. Now with your evil power, akin in strength to a silken thread or a strand of hair, how could you stand against the strength of my perfection?”
He immediately expounded the scriptures saying, “The sea could not contain the volume of mothers’ milk I have produced, the tears I have shed, and the blood which has flowed on my deaths over the innumerable kalpas of my existence. The shoots of love and affection are hard to sever, the round of life and death is hard to halt. I have yet to sever the roots of love and affection and stop the spirit’s round of life and death. In this life I may not be able to remove all the water, but over the course of many, many lives I will.”
Then standing on his two feet Pushi began removing the water with a ladle and throwing it over the Iron Surround (Tiewei 鐵圍).
There was a heavenly being called Bianjing (遍淨 ‘Pervasive Purity’) who heard of this from afar. He thought deeply to himself: “In the past, I heard this man express his aspiration in front of Dīpaṃkara Buddha; he will certainly become a World Honoured One and save all living beings.”
The deity promptly descended to help with the removal of the water. When they had removed eight tenths of it, the sea deities said with fear and regret, “What manner of man is this? He is possessed of limitless spiritual power! Once the waters are gone, our home will be destroyed.”
They emptied their storehouses of all their valuables to give to Pushi, but he refused to accept them, saying, “I only want my pearls! Only they will do!”
The deities returned his pearls and Pushi put the water back. While travelling home he looked out for those to give to, so that once he had passed through a kingdom it no longer had any needy. In each and every such kingdom the rulers altered their behaviour and adopted the Five Rules and implemented the Ten Kinds of Good Behaviour to govern the kingdom. Prisons gates were opened and amnesties granted. Thus, Pushi’s influence reached all living beings, and consequently he attained Buddhahood.
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “Pushi was me. The father is now King Śuddhodana (Baijing wang 白淨王). The mother is now my mother Māyā (Shemiao 舍妙). The ascetic’s daughter is now Gopikā (Juyi 俱夷). The deity in the silver city is now Ānanda (A’nan 阿難), that in the gold city Maudgalyāyana (Mulian 目連) and that in the beryl city, Śāriputra (Shelifu 舍利弗). The Bodhisattva practiced the Four Kindnesses and vowed to seek Buddhahood and save living beings.”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this."

The winds and rains came at the right times and precious grains were plentiful. In a neighbouring kingdom, a lesser king maintained a tyrannous regime where greed and brutality were the norm. The kingdom was a wasteland and the people were impoverished. He said to his assembled officials, “I have heard Changshou’s kingdom is prosperous and wealthy, and not far from here. He embraces humaneness and does not kill and has made no preparations for warfare. I want to take his kingdom by force, could it be done?”
His officials replied, “It could.”
So, he raised an army and advanced on the borders of the great kingdom. The officials charged with guarding the border promptly made a report of the situation and requested permission to make military preparations. Changshou then summoned his ministers for discussions and said, “That king has come because he covets my kingdom’s large population and many treasures. If we go to war with him this will inevitably be injurious to the lives of the people. To benefit oneself and harm the people is greedy and inhumane, I will not act in this way.”
His ministers all said, “We, your servants, are long practiced in military strategy and the rules of warfare, let us take their destruction into our own hands. There is no need for Your Sagely Majesty to trouble yourself further on this matter.”
The King said, “In victory others perish, in defeat I alone die. Both the other side’s troops and my own people were all given life and nourished by Heaven. They consider themselves important and value their lives. Who does not think that? To protect oneself and harm one’s people in the process is something the worthy will not do.”
The officials retired and said, “We cannot risk losing a ruler of such divine humanity!”
They decided among themselves to restrain the enemy king and use soldiers to repel this serious threat. Changshou became aware of this and said to the Crown Prince, “They covet my kingdom and come with evil intent. The officials will harm the peoples’ lives by saving me, One Man [1]. Now I renounce my claim to the throne of this kingdom in the hope of protecting heaven’s people. Do you think that is the right thing to do?”
The Crown Prince replied, “I do.”
Father and son climbed over the city wall, changed their names and hid in the mountain wilderness. When the covetous king entered the kingdom, the officials and the common folk mourned their old ruler like filial sons do the loss of their parents. In every household, grief-stricken, they beat their breasts and stamped their feet in sorrow. The covetous king put a bounty of one thousand ounces of gold and cash worth millions on Changshou’s head.
Changshou went out and, sitting beneath a tree at the side of the road, concentrated his thoughts, feeling compassion for living beings toiling and suffering through life and death, unaware of the Buddhist teachings of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self, deluded by desire, their sufferings incalculable. A brahmin from a distant kingdom, who had heard the king was fond of giving and saving the lives of the common people had come a great distance to seek refuge with Changshou as an indigent and he also took some rest beneath this tree. They respectfully greeted one another and each told the other all about themselves. The brahmin was astonished and said, “Your Heavenly Highness, what has led to this?”
Tears fell as he explained his own situation, “I have but a few years left, so I came to beg in the hope of preserving what’s left of my allotted life-span, but your Great Majesty has lost his kingdom. My life is at an end!”
The brahmin was inconsolable.
The King said, “You came seeking refuge as a destitute just at the time I lost my kingdom and so have no means of helping you. What a disaster!”
Wiping away his tears he said, “I have heard the new king has placed a great price on my head. If you take it to him, you could obtain a rich reward!”
The brahmin answered, “That will not do. From afar I recognised Your Heavenly Majesty’s giving humane succour to living beings, providing sustenance equal to the heavens and the earth. So, I gave up my native land in the hope I could save myself by receiving your care. Now you order me to chop off your head! I dare not accept that order!”
The King said, “The body is but a rotting vessel, how dare I seek to preserve it? In life there is death, who can last forever? If you do not take it, it will merely turn to dust.”
The brahmin said, “Your Heavenly Majesty, you spread the largess of your heavenly kindness, it is inevitable you would die in order to save this lowly being. Please release my hands and follow me as we leave here.”
The King promptly followed him and they went to the gates of his old city. The guard ordered he be bound and reported his arrival. The people of the kingdom saw their King and their sorrowful wailing shook the kingdom. The brahmin obtained his reward and the covetous king ordered that Changshou be burned alive at the crossroads. All his officials asked, “We, the officials of the old ruler who is about to be put to death, beg to be permitted to make a small offering of food to chase away the spirit of the dead.”
The covetous king said, “You may do so.”
All the officials and the common folk thronged the roads, wandering around beating their breasts and stamping their feet in their extreme grief, everyone crying out to the Heavens. The Crown Prince Changsheng pretended to be a firewood seller and stood before his father. His father saw him, and looking heavenward said, “If you go against the teachings bequeathed to you by your father and, filled with poison, harbour murderous feelings, the accumulation of resentment that will ensue will mean passing through ten thousand calamitous years. This would not be the behaviour of a filial son. The benefits of the Buddha’s four types of wide-ranging compassion and its virtuous power envelopes the heavens and the earth. I took this path, sacrificing myself to save the masses. I even fear you will veer slightly from the path of filiality; how much more do I fear your reaping a terrible revenge on an enemy! Do not ignore my words; only then you can be called filial.”
The son could not bear to see his father die and he returned the depths of the mountains. The King’s life ended, and the Crown Prince cried out in mourning till blood flowed from his mouth. He said, “My Lord, although close to death, issued an admonition to exercise utmost humaneness, but I must contravene his wishes and remove one poison with another.”
So he emerged from the mountains and was hired as a labourer growing vegetables for a minister. The minister chanced to be walking in the garden, saw that the vegetables were coming on extremely well and asked about them. The garden superintendent replied, “I hired a man in the marketplace who turned out to be a marvellous gardener.”
The minister asked Changsheng, “What other skills do you have?”
He replied, “I excel at any number of arts.”
The minister invited the King and ordered Changsheng to prepare a meal superior to one prepared by the Grand Provisioner [2]. The King asked, “Who prepared this food?”
The minister explained the situation and the king took Changsheng and appointed him head of his royal kitchen. As he competently dealt with all manner of things, he was selected to become a courtier and the King told him, “King Changshou’s son is my greatest enemy and I regard you as one of my defenders.”
Changsheng responded, “Indeed I am.”
The King asked, “Are you fond of hunting?”
Changsheng replied, “Yes, I am.”
The King took him out hunting, and while galloping in pursuit of wild animals they became separated from the others and the King spent three days alone in the mountains with Changsheng. The King, hungry and exhausted, untied his sword, handed it to Changsheng, laid his head on his knees and slept. Changsheng said, “Now you are at my mercy, aren’t you?”
He unsheathed the sword intending to sever his head, but suddenly remembered his father’s instructions, and said, “This would go against the teachings of my father and render me unfilial.”
He desisted and sheathed his sword. When the King awoke, he said, “Just now I dreamed you were about to chop my head off, what’s going on?”
Changsheng replied, “In the mountain there are powerful demons who delight in inducing fevers. I am guarding you myself, what do you have to fear?”
The King lay down again. This happened three times, and Changsheng finally
threw aside his sword and said, “For the sake of my humane father, I forgive you.”
The King awoke and said, “In my dream I saw you forgive me and allow me to live.”
The Crown Prince said, “I am Changsheng. Remembering my father’s fate, I pursued his enemy till I stand before you today. But as he faced death my father left me with an admonition to be humane and ordered me to honour the Buddhas’ Way by showing forbearance in the face of insult and repaying evil with good. Consumed with stupidity I wanted to harm you, thus mixing two poisons. But three times I thought of my father’s admonition and three times I let go my sword. I hope your August Majesty will act quickly and execute me to rid himself of this serious danger. When I am dead my spirit will disperse and this evil intent will arise no more.”
The King was full of remorse and said, “I have acted tyrannically failing to distinguish good and bad. Your late father whose lofty conduct and was perfectly pure lost his kingdom but did not lose his integrity. He can be truly be called a Higher Sage! You have preserved your parent’s conduct intact and can truly be called filial! Behaving like a jackal or a wolf, I destroyed life as I pleased, and took my fill. Now my life was in your hands yet you forgave me and did not put me to death, how can I act against you? Now I want to return to my kingdom, which way shall I take?”
Changsheng said, “It was I who confused you about the way.”
And he led the King out of the forest and took him to meet with his officials. The King said, “Gentlemen, would you recognise Changsheng?”
They all replied, “We would not.”
The King declared, “This is Changsheng! Now I return his kingdom to him and I will return to my original home. From now on we are brothers and will share good fortune and bad.”
The day he was installed as Crown Prince, within the borders of the kingdom grief and joy mingled, and none did not wish him long life. The covetous king returned to his kingdom. The kingdoms sent tribute to one another, and a prosperous peace ensued.
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “At that time King Changshou was me. The Crown Prince was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難). The covetous king was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達). Lifetime after lifetime Devadatta harboured poisonous intent towards me and yet I saved him time and again. Ānanda and Devadatta never harboured enmity for one another and so they do one another no harm. Lifetime after lifetime I bore the unbearable, but controlled my will and maintained appropriate conduct, thus now I have attained Buddhahood, one honoured throughout the Three Realms.

None lamented on the roads, living beings having each having obtained an appropriate position. The gods all sighed admiringly at this kingdom’s prospering and its people’s flourishing. The royal city walls were over one hundred miles in diameter, and over four hundred miles in circumference, and each day the King fed the people within these walls, each according to his desires. The ruler of the neighbouring domain heard of this kingdom’s abundant harvests and lack of calamites and consulted with his ministers, saying, “That kingdom has had bumper harvests and the common folk are prosperous and happy: I want it. If we were to advance on it, we would certainly be capable of conquering it.”
His officials and attendants all said, “We will happily go along with Your Majesty’s desires.”
So, an army was immediately raised and despatched to that humane kingdom. Its officials heard of this and wanted to resist the attack. The humane king was saddened and said: “Because of me, One Man [1], they will slaughter the common folk; if I remain attached to my life, the lives of the common folk will be damaged. One mouth needs but two meals, one body just a few garments. How could I remonstrate with the times if I depart from the virtue of the springtime [2] and adopt the viciousness of jackals and wolves? I would rather depart this life than depart from my great ambition, to refrain from inflicting on others that which I would not wish on myself and to bring peace to living beings. This is surely heaven’s humaneness.”
As an expedient, he addressed his officials saying, “Return home. We will discuss this further tomorrow.”
When night fell, he climbed over the wall and fled far into the mountains, where he sat beneath a tree. A brahmin of some sixty years old arrived and asked the King, “Is that ruler of the humane kingdom still well blessed and in good health?
He replied, “That King is already dead.”
The brahmin heard this and fell to the ground, grief-stricken. The King asked him,
“Why are you so very upset?” 
He replied, “I heard that King’s humaneness reached all living beings, his kindness like that of Śakra, that is the reason I hastened here to surrender my life to him, but he is dead, and I am old and impoverished.”
The King said, “That king is me. The king of a neighbouring domain heard that my kingdom had bounteous harvests, a flourishing populace and great riches and has ordered his soldiers, saying, ‘Whoever brings me his head will be rewarded with a thousand servants of each sex, one thousand horses, one thousand cattle, and one thousand ounces of each gold and silver.’ Now, if you were to take my head, my crown and my sword to the ruler as proof, your rewards would be huge. You will have wealth to pass on to your descendants, and
I would be delighted.”
He replied, “That would be inhumane and contravene the Way! I would rather die!”
The King said, “Old man! You entrusted your life to me – how can I be responsible for your poverty?  I will give you my head and you will commit no crime.”
He rose and made obeisance to the Ten Directions, tears flowing as he vowed, “I will save all living beings in danger; I will cause those who turn their back on truth and turn towards the wicked to take refuge in the Three Honoured Ones. Now with my head I will uproot your difficulties and ensure you commit no crime.”
He drew his sword and killed himself to save another from difficulty. The brahmin took the head, crown and sword to that other ruler’s residence. This ruler asked the former officials of the old King, “The humane king’s strength matched that of one thousand men. How did this man acquire his head?”
The former officials banged their heads on the floor in a state of collapse. In their extreme mental anguish, none were able to reply. They then asked the brahmin what had happened and he told them the whole story. The common people thronged the streets, crying in the lanes. Some were spitting blood, and some had stopped breathing and looked like corpses. The ruler together with his officials and soldiers, high ranking and low, none did not wail sorrowfully. The ruler looked skyward and sighed deeply, “I have acted without morality. I have destroyed Heaven’s humane son!” [3]
He took the King’s corpse and head and connected them with gold leaf and sat his body at the head of the palace hall. He reigned for thirty-two years as the Son of Heaven [3] and later this ruler established the son of the dead King as the ruler. In the neighbouring kingdoms none did not love him like they would a son. At the end of the humane king’s life he was immediately born in the heavens.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “The humane king was me. The king of the neighbouring kingdom was Maudgalyāyana (Mulian 目連). The kingdom’s officials were today’s bhikṣus.”

  Notes:
[1] ‘One man’ (yiren 一人) is a designation for a ruler – it may be used here as a pun.
[2] This very unusual phrase ‘virtue of the spring’ (chuntian zhi de  春天之德) may refer to the idea common in pre-Buddhist texts that during the spring, when animals give birth, killing should be avoided.  A similar expression, the ‘humaneness of spring’ (chuntian zhi ren 春天之仁), appears in LDJJ 51 and in LDJJ 54.
[3] The Chinese ruler is frequently referred to as the ‘Son of Heaven’ tianzi  天子. Here we see the ruler called “Heaven’s humane son” (tianrenzi 天仁子) and the kingdom referred to as the “humane kingdom”. “Humane” translates ren 仁  a concept much used by Confucian thinkers to mean the very best of human behaviour: on this complex concept see Lai 2017, Chapter 2."

He was one of a pair of brothers and when the King died, he yielded the throne to his younger brother seeing himself as unsuitable for the position. The elder brother took his wife and fled to a distant place. He entered the mountains to study the Way as an ascetic and settled on the banks of a river.
At that time in another kingdom there was a criminal who on the order of the Chamberlain had his hands and feet severed and his nose and ears cut off. He was abandoned in a boat which carried him downstream. The criminal cried out to the heavens continually and the ascetic heard his laments, and grieved, said, “Who is that? He is in extreme distress. Now, one of wide-ranging kindness desirous of treating others as one would like to be treated oneself will attempt to save living beings from their distress, even at risk to their own life; this is the way a Great Being behaves.”
He threw himself into the water and charged into the surge. He intercepted the drifting boat and pulled it ashore. He carried the criminal home on his back and assiduously cared for him and his wounds healed and his life was saved. Four years passed as he looked after him with unflagging kindness. However, his wife’s lasciviousness knew no bounds and she embarked on an affair with the criminal. Plotting to kill her husband, she suggested to her lover, “If you kill him, then I can live with you.”
The criminal said, “He is a man of such virtue! How could I kill him?”
The wife repeated her previous suggestion and the criminal said, “I have neither hands nor feet! I couldn’t kill anyone!”
The wife said, “You stay put. I have a plan.”
She pretended to have a headache and told her husband, “This is certainly the doing of the mountain deity. I want to get rid of it. Tomorrow I will go with you and seek the deity’s blessing.”
Her husband said, “Very good.”
The next day they set off up the precipitous cliff overlooking the river ascending a dozen or so miles. These cliffs rose like walls on three sides, very frightening to all who saw them. The wife told him, “The method requires you stand facing the sun while I will make the offering.”
The husband faced the sun and the wife pretended she was going to walk round him several times, but instead she shoved him off the mountain. Half-way down the mountainside there was a tree whose foliage was dense and soft. The ascetic caught hold of its branches and found a foothold. The fruit of the tree was delicious and eating it saved him. Next to the tree there was a turtle who also ate the fruit every day. He saw there was a person in the tree and was fearful and dared not come close. After five days his hunger emboldened him and he darted to the fruit. As the two were unharmed they gradually they drew closer to one another until one day the ascetic jumped astride the turtle and, frightened, it leapt to the ground. Only the protection of the gods ensured the pair were uninjured.
Following this he returned to his former kingdom and the younger brother yielded the throne to the elder. The elder saved living beings with his wide-ranging kindness and his principle of treating others as he would like to be treated himself. The King governed the country well; every day he came out and made gifts to those within his city walls which stretched some hundred miles in diameter. Carriages, horses, many precious things and food were freely given. Those from all directions, east, west, south and north, were also nurtured with kindness in this way. The king’s meritorious reputation spread and throughout the ten directions his virtue was praised.
The wife, assuming her husband was dead and that the people of the kingdom would not recognise her, carried her amputee husband into the kingdom. She explained herself saying that after marriage they had experienced a period of decline and chaos and horrendous cruelties had been inflicted on her husband. They had come here to throw themselves on the mercy of the King, intending to beg for his help. The people of the kingdom praised her behaviour and instructed them saying, “Our King’s universal kindness reaches all living beings. Tomorrow he will come out of the East Gate to distribute alms. If you go there and meet him, he will value your good conduct and will certainly reward you handsomely.”
The next day they begged from the King. The King recognised them but remained silent and explained to his officials the whole story of his wife. One official said, “We should burn her alive!”
Another official said, “Chop her head off!”
The Minister of Justice said, “There is no greater crime than departing from the right entering the wicked then acting in a treasonable fashion. We ought to nail this wicked man fast onto this poisonous woman’s back so she carries him forever.”
All the gathered officials said, “Quite right! Acting in accordance with her preferred conduct is surely the wise thing to do.”
But the King converted them all using the Ten Kinds of Good Behaviour and there were none among the people who did not joyfully give him their support. The King together with his officials and people all ascended to the heavenly realms on death and the criminal and his wife entered the earth-prisons when they died.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “At that time the king was me. The criminal was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達). The wife was the woman Huaiyu (懷杅 “Embrace-a-bowl”).

《六度集經》卷2：「（一三）薩和檀王經「昔[10]者國王號薩和檀，解曰一切施也，有所求索不逆人意。布施如是，其王名字流聞八方，莫不聞知。時，文殊師利欲往試之，化作年少婆羅門，從異國來詣王宮門，語守門者：『我從遠來，欲見大王。』時守門者即白如[11]此。王甚歡喜，即出奉迎，如子見父，前為作禮，便請令坐。問訊：『道人所從來耶？冒涉塗路得無疲倦？』逝心言：『我在他國聞王功德，故來相見，今欲乞匃。』王言：『大善！所欲得者，莫自疑難。今我名為一切之施，欲求何等？』婆羅門言：『我不用餘，欲得王身與我作奴，及王夫人為我作婢。若能爾者，便隨我去。』王甚[12]歡悅，報言：『大善！今我身者，定自可得，願屬道人供給使令。其夫人者，大國王女，當往問之。』「時，王即入語夫人言：『今有道人，年少端正，從遠方來，欲乞我身持用作奴，今復并欲索卿作婢，當如之何？』其夫人言：『王報云何？』王言：『我[13]已許之作奴，未許卿耳。』時夫人言：『王為相棄，獨自得便，[14]不念度我。』是時夫人即隨王出，白道人言：『願得以身[15]供道人使。』「時婆羅門復語王言：『審實爾不？吾今欲去。』王白道人：『我生布施，未曾有悔，從道人耳。』逝心[16]曰：『汝當隨我，皆悉[17]徒跣，不得著[18]履，當如奴法，莫得[19]不掩。』王與夫人，皆言：『唯諾。從大家教，不敢違命。』時，婆羅門便將奴婢涉道而去。文殊師利即以化人，代其王處及夫人身，領理國事令其如故。「王夫人者，本[20]大國王女，端正無雙，手足柔軟，生長深宮不更寒苦。又復重身懷妊數月，步隨大家舉身皆痛，足底[21]破傷不能復前，疲極在後。時，婆羅門還顧罵言：『汝今作婢，當如婢法，不可以汝本時之態。』夫人長跪白言：『不敢！但小疲極住止息耳。』㖑言：『疾來，促隨我後。』前到國市別賣奴婢，各與一主相去數里。「時，有長者買得此奴，使守斯舍，諸有[22]埋者令收其稅不得妄動。是時婢者，所屬大家夫人甚妒，晨夜令作初不懈息。其後數日時婢[A1]㝃[23]娠所生男兒，夫人恚言：『汝為婢使，那得此兒？』[24]促取殺之。隨大家教，即殺其兒，持行埋之。往到奴所，得共相見，言：『生一男兒，今日已死。不持錢來，今寧[25]可得唐埋之不？』[26]其奴報[27]曰：『大家甚急！備聞此者，罪我不小。卿[28]促持去，更索餘處，不須住此。』王與夫人雖得相見，不說勤苦，各無怨心。「如是言語須臾之頃，恍惚如夢，王及夫人自然還在本國[29]中宮正殿上坐，如前不異，及諸群臣後宮[30]婇女，皆悉如故，所生太子亦自然活。王及夫人心內自疑，何緣致此？文殊師利在虛空中，坐[31]七寶蓮華[32]上，現身色相，讚言：『善哉！今汝布施，至誠如是。』王與夫人踊躍歡喜，即前作禮。文殊師利為說經法，三千剎土為大震動，覆一國人，皆發無上正真道意，王與夫人應時即得不起法忍。」佛告阿難：「是時王者，[33]即我身是。時夫人者，今俱夷是。時太子者今羅[34]云是。」佛[35]言：「阿難！我宿命時，布施如是，用一切人故不惜身命，至無數劫無有恨悔，無所榮冀，自致正覺。菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」」 [10] 者【大】，有【宋】【元】【明】　[11] 此【大】，是【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 歡【大】，懽【明】　[13] 已【大】，以【宋】　[14] 不【大】，不復【宋】【元】【明】　[15] 供【大】，給【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 曰【大】，言【宋】【元】【明】　[17] 徒【大】，度【宋】，踱【元】【明】　[18] 履【大】，屐【元】【明】　[19] 不【大】，而【明】　[20] 大國【大】，國大【宋】【元】【明】　[21] 破傷【大】，傷破【宋】【元】【明】　[22] 埋【大】，理【宋】【元】【明】　[A1] 㝃【CB】【麗-CB】，挽【大】(cf.

His giving was such that whatever was sought, he would never frustrate expectations. The King’s fame spread throughout the eight directions; everyone had heard of him. Once Mañjuśrī (Wenshushili 文殊師利) went to test him, transforming into a young brāhmaṇa and arriving at the King’s palace gates as if from another country. He told the guards, “I have come a great distance desirous of an audience with his Great Majesty.”
The guards promptly reported this and the King, absolutely delighted, came out to welcome the visitor like a son greeting his father. He prostrated himself in obeisance before him and then invited him to sit in the finest seat. The King greeting him respectfully said, “Where have you come from, Master?  Are you not fatigued having braved the roads?” 
The brahmin said, “When I was in another kingdom I heard of your virtue and I came to seek an audience. I have something to ask of you.”
The King said, “Very good. Whatever you desire, do not hesitate to ask for it. My name is ‘Giving Everything’ after all! What is it you want?”
The brāhmaṇa said, “Nothing else will do - I want Your Majesty to be my slave and his Queen to be my maidservant. If you can accede to this request, then let’s leave immediately!”
The King was really delighted and replied, “Very good! You can certainly take me. I want to be your subordinate and follow your bidding. But my wife is the daughter of the king of a great kingdom, so I will have to go and ask her permission.”
The king went straight to the women’s quarters and said to his wife, “Now, there is a brahmin ascetic, young and upright, who has come from afar, and wants to take possession of me as his slave. He also requests you become his maidservant, what do you think of this proposition?”
His wife asked, “How has Your Majesty responded?”
The King said, “I have already consented to act as his slave, but I have yet to consent in respect of you.”
His wife then responded, “If Your Majesty leaves me behind, he alone will reap the benefits. You are not concerned with saving me!”
The wife then followed her husband and set off. They told the brahmin ascetic, “We want to devote ourselves to your service, Master.”
Then the brāhmaṇa spoke again to the King saying, “Are you really sure? I want to leave now.”
The King replied, “I have never had any regrets about giving! I will follow you, Master.”
The brahmin said, “You both must follow me barefoot, you cannot wear shoes. You must behave like slaves, and none of them get to cover their feet.”
The King and his wife both said, “Of course! We will follow our master’s instruction! We would dare not violate your command!”
Then the brāhmaṇa took his slave and maidservant and they set off on their journey. Mañjuśrī then magically conjured two persons to stand in for the King and his wife, who governed the affairs of the kingdom just as before.
The King’s wife was originally the daughter of the ruler of a great kingdom and her rectitude was peerless. But having been born in the confines of the palace her hands and feet were soft and she had never experienced cold nor hardship. Further, she was several months pregnant and as she followed her master on foot her entire body was wracked with pain, the soles of her feet were feet battered and bruised. Unable to go any further, she fell behind exhausted. The brāhmaṇa then turned and cursed her, saying, “You are a maidservant now, act like one! You cannot maintain the airs of your former status!”
The wife knelt and said, “I would not dare! It’s just I am a little tired and stopped to rest.”
Berating her he said, “Come quickly and keep close behind me!”
They went on and when they reached the kingdom’s market, the slave and maidservant were sold on to others, each went with a new master ending up several miles apart.
A householder purchased the slave and ordered him to guard a graveyard and to exact a duty from all comers seeking to carry out a burial and to prevent them from acting as they pleased. Meanwhile, the maidservant was part of a household where her master’s wife was extremely jealous. Day and night, she ordered her about. At first, she worked tirelessly, but after a few days she gave birth to a son. The wife of her owner said furiously, “You are a maidservant, how can you have a child? Quickly go and kill it!” 
Following her mistress’ orders, she immediately killed her son and went to bury him. She arrived at the place the slave was guarding and they saw each other. She told him, “I gave birth to a son, but now he is dead. I have no money. Would it be possible to give him a decent burial?”
The servant said, “My master is extremely irritable. If he gets to hear about this, he will blame me in no small measure. Take him away quickly and find another place, you can’t stay here.” 
Although they got to see one another, they did not talk of their struggles and suffering, and neither harboured any resentment towards the other.
As they spoke, in an instant, things became hazy and dreamlike. The King and his wife found themselves spontaneously returned to their thrones in the central hall of their palace in their kingdom, just as they had been before the arrival of the brāhmaṇa. All the officials and all the women of the Rear Palace were all just as they had been. The prince who had been born also revived spontaneously. The King and his wife asked themselves what had brought this about. Mañjuśrī appeared in the air before them sitting on a seven-jewelled lotus, manifesting all the bodily marks, and praised them saying, “Excellent! Your giving was done with the utmost sincerity.”
The King and his wife were elated and did obeisance before him. Mañjuśrī preached the scriptures of the Buddha’s law, and the triple-thousand Buddha field shook with force. Mañjuśrī’s teachings reached all the kingdom’s people each one of whom one of whom conceived an intention to achieve the Supreme, Perfect Awakening. The King and his wife instantly attained the forbearance associated with the non-arising of phenomena.
The Buddha told Ānanda (A’nan 阿難): “The king of that time is now me, his wife is now Gopikā (Juyi 俱夷), and the prince is now Rāhula (Luoyun 羅云).”
The Buddha said, “Ānanda! In my previous lives my giving was like this. For the sake of all people I did not value my life; for innumerable kalpas, I had no regrets, yearned for no glory, and through these efforts of mine I achieved true awareness.”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this."
"《六度集經》卷2：「（一四）須大拏經「昔者葉波[36]國王號曰濕隨，其名薩闍，治國以正，黎庶無怨。王有太子，名須大拏，容儀光世，慈孝難齊，四等普護，言不傷人。王有一子寶之無量，太子事親同之於天。有知之來，『常願布施拯濟群生，令吾後世受福無窮。愚者不覩非常之變，謂之可保。有智之士照有五家，乃尚布施之士。十方諸佛、緣一覺、無所著尊，靡不歎施為世上寶。』太子遂隆普施，惠逮[1]眾生。欲得衣食者應聲惠之，金銀眾珍、車馬田宅，無求不與。光馨遠被，四海咨嗟。父王有一白象，威猛武勢躃六十象，怨國來戰，象輙得勝。「諸王議曰：『太子賢聖無求不惠。遣梵志八人之太子所，令乞白象。若能得之，吾重謝子。』受命即行，著鹿皮衣履屣執瓶，[2]𨱜杖遠涉，歷諸郡縣千有餘里，到葉波國，俱柱杖翹一脚向宮門立，謂衛士曰：『吾聞太子布施貧乏潤逮群生，故自遠涉乞吾所乏。』衛士即入，如事表聞。太子聞之欣然馳迎，猶子覩親，稽首接足慰勞之曰：『所由來乎苦體如何？欲所求索以一脚住乎？』對曰：『太子德光周聞八方，上達蒼天下至黃泉，巍巍如太山，靡不歎仰。卿為天人之子，吐言必信。審[3]尚布施不違眾願者，今欲乞匃行蓮華上白象，象名羅闍惒[4]大檀。』太子曰：『大善！[5]唯上諸君金銀雜寶恣心所求，無以自難。』即勅侍者，疾[6]被白象金銀鞍勒牽之來矣。左持象勒，右持金甕，澡梵志手，慈歡授象。梵志大喜，即呪願竟，俱[7]升騎象含笑而去。「相國百揆靡不悵然，僉曰：『斯象猛力之雄，國恃以寧，敵仇交戰，輙為震奔。而今惠讎國，將何恃？』俱現陳曰：『夫白象者，勢力能躃六十象，斯國却敵之寶。而太子以惠重怨，中藏日虛，太子自恣布施不休，數年之間，臣等懼舉國妻子必為施惠之物矣。』王聞其言，慘然久而曰：『太子好喜佛道，以[8]賙窮濟乏慈育群生，為行之元首。[9]縱得禁止假使拘罰，斯為無道矣。』百揆僉曰：『切[10]磋之教儀無失矣，拘罰為虐臣敢聞之？逐令出國置于田野，十年之間令慙自悔，臣等之願也。』王即遣使者就[11]誥之曰：『象是國寶，惠怨胡為？不忍加罰，疾出國去。』使者奉命[＊]誥之如斯。太子對曰：『不敢違天命。願乞布施濟乏七日，出國無恨。』使者以聞，王曰：『疾去，不聽汝也。』使者[12]反曰：『王命不從。』太子重曰：『不敢違天命。吾有私財，不敢侵國。』使者又聞，王即聽之。「太子欣然勅侍者：『國中黎庶有窮乏者，勸之疾來，從其所欲恣之無違。國土官爵、田宅財寶，幻夢之類，靡不磨滅。』兆民巨細奔詣宮門，太子以飲食衣被、七寶諸珍，恣民所欲布施訖竟，貧者皆富。妻名[13]曼坻，諸王之女，顏華[14]韑耀，一國無雙，自首至足皆以七寶瓔珞。謂其妻曰：『起聽吾言，大王徙吾著檀特山，十年為限。汝知之乎？』妻驚而起，視太子淚出，且云：『將有何罪乃見[15]迸逐，捐國尊榮處深山乎？』答其妻曰：『以吾布施虛耗國內，名象戰寶以施怨家。王逮群臣恚逐我耳。』妻即稱願：『使國豐熟，王臣兆民富壽無極，惟當建志於彼山澤成道弘誓矣。』「太子曰：『惟彼山澤恐怖之處，虎狼害獸難為止矣。又有毒蟲魍魎[16]斃鬼、雷電霹靂風雨雲霧，其甚可畏。寒暑過度，樹木難依，蒺䔧礫石非[17]卿所堪。爾王者之子，生[18]於榮樂、長於中宮，衣[19]則細軟，飲食甘美，臥則帷帳，眾樂聒耳，願[＊]則恣心。今處山澤，臥[＊]則草蓐、食[＊]則果蓏，非人所忍，何以堪之乎？』妻曰：『細靡眾寶帷帳甘美，何益於己？而與太子生離居乎？大王出時以幡為[20]幟，火以煙為[＊]幟，婦人以夫為[＊]幟，吾恃太子猶孩恃親，太子在國布施四遠，吾輙同願。今當歷[21]嶮而[22]猶留守榮，豈仁道哉？儻有來乞不覩所[23]天，心之感[24]絕，必死無疑。』太子曰：『遠國之人來乞妻子，吾無逆心。爾為情戀，儻違惠道都絕洪潤，壞吾重任也。』妻曰：『太子布施覩世希有，當[25]卒弘誓慎無倦矣。百千萬世，無人如卿[26]逮佛重任，吾不敢違也。』太子曰：『善！』即將妻子詣母辭別，稽首于地愍然辭曰：『願捐重[27]思，保寧[28]玉體，國事鞅掌[29]願數慈諫，無以自由枉彼天民。當忍不可忍，含忍為寶。』母聞訣辭顧謂侍曰：『吾身如石、心猶剛鐵，今有一子而見迸逐，吾何心哉？未有子時結願求嗣，懷妊之日如樹含華，日須其成，天不奪願令吾有子，今育成就而當生離乎？』夫人嬪妾，嫉者快喜不復相敬。「[30]大子妻兒稽首拜退，宮內巨細靡不哽[31]噎，出與百揆吏民哀訣，俱出城去，靡不竊云：『[＊]大子國之聖靈、眾寶之尊，二親何心而逐之乎？』[＊]大子坐城外謝諸送者，遣之還居。兆民拜伏，僉然舉哀，或有躃踊呼天，音響[1]振國。與妻進道，自知去本國遠，坐一樹下。有梵志自遠來乞，解身寶服、妻子珠璣，盡以惠之，令妻子昇車執轡而去。始欲就道，又逢梵志來從[2]乞馬，以馬惠之；自於轅中[3]挽車進道。又逢梵志來匃其車，即下妻子，以車惠之。太子車馬衣裘身寶雜物，都盡無餘，令妻嬰女，己自抱男。處國之時，施彼名象眾寶車馬，至見毀逐，未曾[4]恚悔，和心相隨，歡喜入山。三七二十一日乃到檀特山中。「太子覩山樹木茂盛，流泉美水甘果備焉，鳧鴈鴛鴦遊戲其間，百鳥嚶嚶相和悲鳴。太子覩之謂其妻曰：『爾觀斯山，樹木[5]參天尠有折傷，群鳥悲鳴，每處有泉，眾果甚多以為飲食；[＊]唯道是務，無[6]以違誓。』山中道士皆守節好學，有一道士名阿[7]周陀，久處山間有玄妙之德。即與妻子詣之稽首，却叉手立，向道士曰：『吾將妻子來斯學道，願垂洪慈，誨成吾志也。』道士誨之，太子則焉，柴草為屋，結髮葌服，食果飲泉。男名耶利，衣小草服，從父出入；女名罽拏延，著鹿皮衣，從母出入。處山一宿，天為增泉其味重甘，生藥樹木名果茂盛。「後有鳩留縣老貧梵志，其妻年豐，顏華端正，提瓶行汲。道逢年少遮要，調曰：『爾[8]居貧乎無以自全，貪彼老財庶以歸居。彼翁學道內否不[9]通，教化之紀，希成一人。[10]專愚𢤱[11]悷，爾將所貪乎？顏狀醜黑，鼻正匾𠥶，身體繚戾，面皺脣䫂[12](丁可反)，言語[13]蹇吃，兩目又青，狀類[14]若鬼，舉身無好，孰不[15]僫憎？爾為室家，將無愧厭乎？』婦聞調[16]婿，流淚而[17]云：『吾覩彼翁[18]鬢鬚正白，猶霜著樹。朝夕[19]希心，欲其早喪。未即從願，無如之何？』歸向其婿，如事具云，曰：『子有奴使，妾不行汲。若其如今，吾[20]去子矣。』婿曰：『吾貧，緣獲給使乎？』妻曰：『吾聞布施上士名須大拏，洪慈濟眾虛耗其國。王逮群臣，徙著山中。其有兩兒，乞則惠卿。』「妻數有言，[21]愛婦難違，即用其言，到葉波國，詣宮門曰：『太子安之乎？』衛士上聞。王聞斯言，心結內塞，涕泣交流，有頃而曰：『太子見逐，惟為斯輩；而今復來乎？』請現勞倈，問其所以。對曰：『太子潤馨，遐邇詠歌，故遠歸命，庶自穌息。』王曰：『太子眾寶布施都盡，今處深山，衣食不充，何以惠子？』對曰：『德徽巍巍，遠自[22]竭慕，貴覩光顏，沒齒無恨也。』王使人示其徑路。「道逢獵士，曰：『子經歷諸山，寧覩太子不？』獵士素知太子[23]迸逐所由，勃然罵曰：『吾斬爾首，問太子為乎？』梵志恧然而懼曰：『吾必為子所殺矣！當權而詭之耳。』曰：『王逮群臣令呼太子還國為王。』答曰：『大善！』喜示其處。「遙見小屋，太子亦覩其來。兩兒覩之中心怛懼，兄弟俱曰：『吾父尚施，而斯子來，財盡無副，必以吾兄弟惠[24]與之。』擕手俱[25]逃。母故[26]掘[27]蔭其埳容人，二兒入中以柴覆上，自相誡曰：『父呼無應也。』「太子仰問，請其前坐，果漿置前。食果[28]飲畢，慰勞之曰：『歷遠疲倦矣！』對曰：『吾自彼來，舉身[29]惱痛，又大飢渴。太子光馨，八方歎懿，巍巍遠照。有如太山，天神地祇，孰不甚[30]善，今故[31]遠歸窮，庶延微命。』太子惻然曰：『財盡無惜矣。』梵志曰：『可以二兒給養吾老矣。』答曰：『子遠來求兒，吾無違心。』太子呼焉，兄弟懼矣。又相謂曰：『吾父呼求，必以惠鬼也。』違命無應。太子隱其在埳，發柴覩之，兒出抱父戰慄涕泣，呼號且言：『彼是鬼也！非梵志矣！吾數覩梵志，顏類未有若茲，無以吾等為鬼作食。吾母採果來歸何遲？今日定死，為鬼所噉。母歸索吾，當如牛母索其犢子，狂走哀慟。父必悔矣。』太子曰：『自生布施未甞微悔，吾以許焉，爾無違矣。』梵志曰：『子以普慈相惠，兒母歸者即敗子[32]洪潤違吾本願，不如早[33]去。』太子曰：『卿願求兒，故自遠來，終不敢[34]違，便可速邁。』「太子右手沃澡，左手持兒，授彼梵志。梵志曰：『吾老氣微，兒捨[35]遁邁之其母所，吾緣獲之乎？太子弘惠，縛以相付。』太子持兒令梵志縛，自[36]手[37]執繩端，兩兒躃身宛轉[38]父前，哀號呼母曰：『天神地祇山樹諸神一哀，告吾母意云：「兩兒以惠人，[39]宜急捨彼菓，可一相見。」』哀感二儀，山神愴然，為作大響有若雷震。母時採果，心為[40]忪忪，仰看[41]蒼天不覩雲雨，右目瞤左[42]腋痒，兩乳湩流出相屬，母惟之曰：『斯怪甚大！吾[1]用菓為？急歸視兒，將有他乎？』委菓旋歸，惶惶如狂。「[2]帝釋念曰：『菩薩志隆，欲成其弘誓之重[3]任，妻到壞其高志也。』化為師子，當道而蹲。婦曰：『卿是獸中之王，吾亦人中[4]王子，俱[5]止斯山，吾有兩兒皆尚微細，朝來未食須望我耳。』師子避之，婦得進路。迴復於前化作白狼，婦辭如前，狼又避焉。又化為虎，適梵志遠，乃遂退矣。「婦還，覩太子獨坐，慘然怖曰：『吾兒如之而今獨坐，兒常望覩吾以菓歸，奔走趣吾，躃地復起，跳踉喜笑，曰：「母歸矣，飢兒飽矣。」今不覩之，將以惠人乎？吾坐兒立各在左右，覩身有塵，競[6]共拂拭。今兒不來，又不覩處，卿以惠誰？可早相語。禱祀乾坤，情實難云，乃致良嗣。今兒戲具，泥象泥牛、泥馬泥猪，雜巧諸物[7]縱橫于地，覩之心感，吾且發狂，將為虎狼鬼[8]𩲐盜賊[9]吞乎？疾釋斯結，吾必死矣！』太子久而乃言：『有一梵志來索兩兒云：「年盡命微欲以自濟。」吾以惠之。』婦聞斯言，感踊躃地，宛轉哀慟流淚且云：『審如所夢，一夜之中夢覩老[10]𥥧貧窶梵志，割吾兩乳執之疾馳；正為今也。』哀慟呼天，動一山間。云：『吾子如之，當如行求乎？』「太子覩妻哀[11]慟尤甚，[12]而謂之曰：『吾本[13]盟爾隆孝奉遵，吾志大道，尚濟眾生，無求不惠，[14]言誓甚明。而今哀慟，以亂[15]我心？』妻曰：『太子求道，厥勞何甚？夫[16]士[17]家尊在于妻子之間，靡不自由，豈況人尊乎？願曰：「所索必獲，如一切智。」』「帝釋諸天僉然議曰：『太子[18]弘道普施無[19]蓋，試之以妻觀心如何。』釋化為梵志來之其前，曰：『吾聞子懷[20]以乾坤之仁，普濟群生布施無逆，故來歸情，子妻賢貞德馨遠聞，故來乞匃，儻肯相惠乎？』答曰：『大善！』以右手持水澡梵志手，左手提妻適欲授之。諸天稱壽莫不歎善，天地卒然大動，人鬼靡不驚焉。梵志曰：『止！吾不取也。』答曰：『斯[21]婦豈有惡耶？婦人之惡斯都無有，婦人之禮斯為備首矣。然其父王[＊]唯有斯女，盡禮事婿不避塗炭，衣食趣可不求細甘，勤力精健顏華踰輩。卿取吾喜，除患最善。』梵志曰：『婦之賢快誠如子言，敬諾受之。吾以寄子，無以惠人。』又曰：『吾是天帝[22]釋，非世庸人也，故來試子。子尚佛慧影，範難雙矣，今欲何願，恣求必從。』太子曰：『願獲大富，常好布施無貪踰今；令吾父王及國臣民思得相見。』天帝[＊]釋曰：『善！』應時不現。「梵志喜獲其志，行不覺疲，連牽兩兒欲得望使。兒王者之孫，榮樂自由，去其二親為繩所縛，結處皆傷，哀號呼母，鞭而走之。梵志晝寢，二兒迸逃，自沈池中，荷[23]蒻覆上，水蟲編身。寤行尋求，又得兒矣；捶杖[＊]縱橫，血流丹地。天神愍念，解縛[24]愈傷，為生甘果，令地柔軟。兄弟摘果，更相授[25]噉，曰：『斯果之甘猶苑中果，斯地柔軟如王邊[26]縕綖矣。』兄弟相扶仰天呼母，涕泣流身。梵志所行，其地岑巖，礫石刺棘，身及足蹠，其瘡毒痛，若覩樹果，或苦且辛，梵志皮骨相連，兩兒肌膚光[27]澤，顏色復故。「歸到其家，喜笑且云：『吾為爾得奴婢二人，自從所使。』妻覩兒曰：『奴婢不爾，斯兒端正，手足悅澤不任作勞，[28]孚行衒賣，更買所使。』又為妻使，欲之異國。天惑其路，乃之本土。兆民識焉，僉曰：『斯太子兒也！大王孫矣！』哽噎詣門上聞。王呼梵志將兒入宮，宮人巨細靡不噓唏！王呼欲抱，兩兒不就。王曰：『何以？』兒曰：『昔為王孫，今為奴婢。奴婢之賤，緣坐王膝乎？』問梵志曰：『緣得斯兒？』對之如事。曰：『賣兒幾錢？』梵志未答，男孫[29]勦曰：『男直銀錢一千，特[30]牛百頭；女直金錢二[31]千，牸[32]牛二百頭。』王曰：『男長而賤，女幼而貴。其有緣乎？』對曰：『太子既聖且仁，潤齊二儀天下喜附，猶孩依親，斯獲天下之明圖，而見遠逐捐處山澤，虎狼毒蟲與之為隣，食菓衣草，雷雨震人，夫財幣草芥之類耳，坐見[33]迸棄，故知男賤也。黎庶之女，苟以華色處在深宮，臥即[34]縕綖，蓋以寶帳，衣天下之名服，食天下之貢獻，[35]故女貴也。』王曰：『年八[36]孩童，有高士之論，豈況其父乎？』宮人巨細聞其諷諫莫不舉哀。梵志曰：『直銀錢一千，特牛、[37]牸牛各百頭。惠爾者善，不者自已。』王曰：『諾。』即[38]雇如數，梵志退矣。「王抱兩孫坐之于膝，[39]王曰：『屬不就抱，今來何疾乎？』對曰：『屬是奴婢，今為王孫。』曰：『汝父處山，何食自供？』兩兒俱曰：『薇菜樹果以自給耳。日與禽獸百鳥相娛，亦無愁心。』王遣使者迎焉。使者就道，山中樹木俯仰屈伸，似有跪起之禮，百鳥悲鳴哀音感情。太子曰：『斯者何瑞？』妻臥地曰：『[1]父意解釋，使者來迎，神祇助喜，故興[A2]此瑞。』妻自亡兒臥地，使者到乃起拜王命矣。使者曰：『王逮皇后[2]捐食[3]銜泣，身命日衰，思覩太子。』太子左右顧望，戀慕山中樹木流泉，[4]收淚昇車。「自使者發，舉國歡喜，治道掃除[5]豫施帳幔，燒香散[6]華伎樂幢蓋，舉國趍蹌，稱壽無量。[＊]大子入城頓首謝過，退[7]勞起居。王復以國藏珍寶都付太子，勸令布施。隣國困民歸化首尾，猶眾川之歸海。宿怨[8]都然，拜表稱臣，貢獻相[9]銜。賊寇尚仁，偷[10]賊競施，干戈戢藏，囹圄毀矣。群生永康，十方稱善。積德不休，遂獲如來、無所著、正真道、最正覺、道法御、天人師，獨步三界為眾聖王矣。」佛告諸比丘：「吾受諸佛重任誓濟群生，[11]雖嬰極苦，今為無蓋尊矣。太子後終，生兜術天；自天來下，[12]由白淨王生，今吾身是也。父王者，阿難是。妻[13]者，[14]俱夷是。子男羅云是，女者羅漢[15]朱遲母是。天帝釋者，彌勒是。射獵者，優陀耶是。阿[16]周陀者，大迦葉是。賣兒梵志者，調達是。妻[17]者，今調達妻旃遮是。吾宿命來勤苦無數，終不恐懼而違弘誓矣。以布施法為弟子說之，菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」」(CBETA

His crown prince was named Xudana (須大拏, Sudāna), and his countenance lit the world. His kindness and filiality were hard to match; his practice of the Four Equalities [1] protected all and his words never hurt others. The King had but one son, and he treasured him beyond measure; the Crown Prince served his parents as if they were gods.
A wise man arrived and announced, “A constant desire to give and save living beings, will cause one to receive limitless blessings in future lives. The foolish do not understand the inconstant, changing nature of things and assume they can be preserved; the wise perceive there are Five Classes of Threat [1], yet still give. The Buddhas of the Ten Directions, those who have Awakened to Causation Alone (pratyekabuddhas), and those Respected Ones Unbound by Ties (arhats), all without exception admire giving as the most highly prized quality.”
The Crown Prince thereupon increased his already widespread giving, his favour reaching all living beings. To those who wanted clothes and food, he responded by giving them what they wanted. Gold, silver, any other type of precious rarity, carriages, horses, fields and dwellings; there was nothing sought which was not given. His glowing reputation reached far, and across the four seas all praised him.
His royal father had a white elephant, brave and fierce in battle with the power to topple sixty elephants; when enemy kingdoms came to wage war the elephant would invariably ensure victory. The kings of enemy states discussed this saying, “The Crown Prince is a worthy sage, he gives anything he is asked for.  Let’s send eight brahmins to the Crown Prince and get them to beg for the white elephant.”
They said to the brahmins, “If you are able to get it, we will liberally show our thanks.”
The brahmins received their orders and set off, wearing deer skin clothing and shoes, holding bottles and carrying sticks for the long and arduous journey. They passed through many commanderies and districts and having travelled several hundred miles reached the kingdom of the Śibis. Holding their sticks aloft they approached the palace gate as one, stopped and said to the guard, “We have heard that the Crown Prince gives to the poor, and enriches all beings; this is why we have travelled from afar to beg for what we lack.”
The guard immediately entered the palace confines and reported this matter to his superiors. When the Crown Prince heard he joyfully hurried to greet them as a son would having caught sight of his parents. He touched his head to the floor and respectfully took their feet in his hands and concerned, asked them, “From whence have you come? How are your suffering limbs? What have you come here for?”
They replied, “The light of the Crown Prince’s virtue illuminates the eight directions; it reaches the cerulean heavens and penetrates to the Yellow Springs; it is lofty like Mount Tai! None do not praise and admire you! You are the son of a heavenly being, your words are certainly trustworthy! You hold giving in high esteem and refuse no request. Now we would like to ask for the white elephant who rides on a lotus flower, the elephant by the name of Luoduhuodatan (羅闍惒大檀) [2]”
The Crown Prince said, “Excellent! And I’ll throw in whatever else you gentlemen desire — gold, silver, precious jewels—you’ll have no opposition from me.”
Immediately he ordered his attendants to see to the request and they promptly led out the white elephant caparisoned in gold and silver. An attendant on the left held the elephant’s bridle and the one on the right held a golden urn for washing the hands of the brahmins. The Prince happily handed over the elephant. The brahmins were delighted, and gave an invocation in thanks, got onto the elephant and left, smirking.
The prime minister and the officials were all very upset. They said, “The kingdom has relied on this elephant’s fierce and powerful virility to keep the peace. When our enemies waged war it always the elephant that made them retreat, and now it has been given to our foes. What will we rely on in the future?”
They all made their position known to the King, saying, “This white elephant had the power to topple sixty elephants, it was our kingdom’s enemy-repelling treasure, yet the Crown Prince has given it to our enemies! The royal coffers grow emptier by the day! If the Crown Prince continues to indulge himself in this ceaseless giving, we fear that at this rate within a few years it will be the kingdom’s wives and children being given away.”
The King listened to their words and looked grieved for a long while then said, “The Crown Prince is fond of the Way of the Buddha. He regards relieving the poverty-stricken and assisting those in need and kindly nurturing living beings, as the ultimate in good conduct. If I forbade him or had him imprisoned this would not be in accordance with the Way.”
The ministers told him, “We have thoroughly discussed the matter and believe we have found a way whereby the rules of the teachings will not be infringed. We dare not ask you to capture him and punish his excesses, but if the Crown Prince were to be expelled, made to leave the kingdom and settle in the wilderness, within ten years he will come to regret his actions. We are all agreed on this course of action.”
The King immediately dispatched an envoy to go and inform the Crown Prince who asked on behalf of the ruler, “That elephant was a treasure of our kingdom, why did you give it to our enemies? We cannot bear to punish you so request you leave the kingdom forthwith.”
The envoy acting under orders conveyed this message to him. The Crown Prince replied, “I do not dare to go against Heaven’s Decree, but may I be permitted to give and help the needy for seven days? Then I can leave the kingdom without regret.”
The envoy reported this and the King said, “Tell him to leave immediately! I do not permit this.”
The envoy returned and said, “The King orders you not to do this.”
The Crown Prince repeated, “I do not dare to go against Heaven’s Decree, but I do have private assets. I would not dare to use the state’s!”
The envoy once again reported this to the King who immediately gave his permission. The Crown Prince joyfully ordered his attendants to encourage the poor among the common people of the kingdom to come quickly and ask for whatever they want assuring them there would be no objections: royal lands, official rank, fields and dwellings, money and valuables – whatever they dreamt of having they need dream no longer. The people, young and old, hastened to the palace gates. The Crown Prince gave the people whatever they desired, food and drink, clothing, the seven precious things and all kinds of rarities, giving until there was nothing left to give and the poor had all been made wealthy.
  The Crown Prince’s wife was a woman of royal blood named Mandi (曼坻, Madrī). Her beautiful countenance shone; she was without peer in the entire kingdom. From head to toe she was garlanded in the seven precious materials, jade and gemstones. He said to his wife, “Come and listen to me. His Majesty has ordered me to live at Mount Tante (檀特山, Dantaloka) for ten years. Do you understand what this means?”
His wife stood up, alarmed. Looking at the Crown Prince tears flowed and she said, “What crime sees you banished, made to abandon your kingdom, your rank, and your honour and live deep in the mountains?”
He replied to his wife, “My giving has used up all the kingdom’s resources and I gave our famed elephant, so treasured in war, to our enemies. The King and his officials were furious and banished me!”
The wife immediately spoke her mind saying, “I want the kingdom to be prosperous, and the King, his officials, and the common folk to live lives of unlimited length and good fortune. This will only come about if you fulfil your aim in the wilderness and honouring your Great Vow to perfect the Way.”
The Crown Prince said, “But the wilderness is a terrifying place: tigers, wolves and other dangerous beasts make living there hard. Many other extremely frightening things are found there – poisonous insects, vengeful wraiths, ghosts of the dead, thunder and lightning, winds, rains, clouds and fog. The cold and heat are excessive, and trees have to be relied on for shelter. Thorny vines and pebbles cover the ground. You couldn’t stand it.  You were born in a line of kings amidst splendour and happiness and grew up in the Central Palace with fine, soft clothing and sweet tasting food, sleeping behind curtains with music assailing your ears, your every fancy indulged. In the wilderness you would sleep on grass and rushes and eat fruit; a normal person couldn’t bear this, how could you?”
His wife replied, “How would fine, soft and precious things, bed-curtains, and sweet fare benefit me were I to be separated from the Crown Prince? When a great king sets out, he uses pennants to mark his position, as fire uses smoke, and a wife her husband. I rely on the Crown Prince as a child does her parents; when the Crown Prince gave to the four corners of the kingdom, I was always in agreement with this. Would it be appropriate for me to remain here in luxury while you undergo these perils? Is that the humane Way? What if a supplicant comes and does not get to see my royal husband? [3] Cut off from he who moves my heart I will die without a doubt!”
The Crown Prince said, “If a person comes from afar and begs for my wife and children, I will not frustrate their desires. You are the one I yearn for, but were I to violate the Way of Giving, that would end my great bounty and destroy my weighty undertaking.”
His wife said, “The Crown Prince’s giving is such as is rarely seen in this world, you ought to fulfil your Great Vow, meticulously and untiringly. For millions of generations there has been no one who can compare with you. When it comes to the Buddha’s weighty undertaking, I do not dare oppose.”
The Crown Prince said, “Excellent!”
  The Crown Prince took his wife and children to visit his mother to bid farewell. Bowing his head to the ground, grieved he bade her farewell saying, “I hope you will abandon all thoughts of me and take care of your gracious person. The affairs of state are multitudinous so I hope you will kindly admonish the king frequently. I have no way to save myself from being treated unjustly by the people. I will bear the unbearable and treat the bearing of it as precious.”
His mother heard this farewell speech and turned to her attendants and said, “My body is like stone, my heart like unyielding iron. But I have just one son and I now see him banished. What about me? Before I had a son, I made a vow begging for posterity and from the day I became pregnant, I was like a tree in bud, daily awaiting the ripening. The gods did not snatch away what I so desired and allowed me to bear a son; now having nourished him to adulthood, must I be parted from him in life?”
Among the lady’s palace women, the jealous delighted in her misfortune and no longer showed her any respect. The Crown Prince, his wife and children bowed their heads to the ground in respect and withdrew. Within the palace there were none, of high rank or low, who did not choke with sobs.
The family went beyond the city walls with all the officials and commoners to mournfully bid farewell. None did not secretly think to themselves, “The Crown Prince is the sage of our kingdom, the most venerated of many treasures; how can his parents have the heart to banish him?”
The Crown Prince sat outside the walls bidding farewell to those who came to see him off. He sent them back home, and the common folk prostrated themselves, all wailing with grief, some beat their chest and stamped their feet cursing the gods. The sound rocked the kingdom as the Crown Prince and his wife set off on their journey.
  Knowing they had travelled far from their homeland the Crown Prince sat to rest beneath a tree. A brahmin had come from afar to beg, so he took off his own bejewelled garments, and took his wife and children’s jewels and gave them to him, then ordered his wife and children to climb on board the carriage and took up the reins and readied himself to leave. Just as he was about to set off, another brahmin appeared who had come to ask for his horse. He gave it to him and placing himself within the traces pulled the carriage along the road. Again, he met another brahmin who had come to ask for the carriage so he told his wife and children to get down and gave it to him. Now the Crown Prince’s carriage, horse, summer and winter clothing, body ornaments and all manner of other things were completely gone – nothing was left. He told his wife to carry their daughter and he carried the boy himself. When in his kingdom, he had given away that famous elephant, assorted jewels, carriages and horses, and even when he met with ruin and was expelled, he had never felt any regret; mental equanimity followed his actions and he was happy to enter the mountains.
  After three weeks they arrived at Mount Tante. The Crown Prince observed the mountains, replete with luxuriant trees. Fine water was flowing in the streams and sweet-tasting fruits were growing. Wild geese and mandarin ducks frolicked and the birds sang, their mournful cries in harmony. The Crown Prince saw all this and said to his wife, “Look at these mountains! The trees reach high into the sky with barely a blemish, flocks of birds cry mournfully; there are springs everywhere and fruits grow in abundance; these will provide us with food and drink. I will concentrate solely on the Way and there will be nothing which might cause me to violate my vow.”
  The ascetics living on the mountain were all morally upstanding and fond of study. There was one scholar called Azhoutou (阿周陀, Accuta) who had long lived among the mountains and whose virtue was particularly profound. Without delay, the Crown Prince went to visit him with his wife and children and bowing his head, stepped back and stood with his hands together in respect and said to the ascetic, “I have come with my wife and children to study the Way. It is my hope that you will deign in your vast compassion to instruct me how to fulfil my aspiration.”
The ascetic instructed him and the Crown Prince modelled himself on him, building his dwelling from brushwood and grass, tying up his hair, using cogon grass for clothing, eating fruits and drinking spring water. His son was called Yali (耶利, Jālin); clad in small grass clothing, he followed his father everywhere. His daughter was called Jinayan (罽拏延, Kṛṣṇājinā); wearing deer-skin clothing, she followed her mother everywhere. Their first night on the mountain, the gods increased the flow of the spring water and made it sweeter and induced a medicinal tree called the ""fruits of abundance"" to grow.
  Sometime later, in Jiuliu (鳩留縣) district, there was an old, impoverished brahmin. His young and very beautiful wife picked up her pitcher and went to draw water. On the way she met with some youngsters who barred her way and taunted her saying: “You live in poverty! You have no way to protect yourself! Lusted after by that miser, you should go back home to your parents! That old man studies the Way, but blocked, he hasn’t got what it takes to understand the teachings he hopes will make a man of him! Such stupidity cannot be trained. How can you desire that? Ugly and dark, with a straight, flat nose, and a body bent and twisted. Wrinkled face and unsightly lips, he stammers and stutters. With his two black eyes, he looks like a ghost. He has no redeeming features and everyone hates him! You are his wife - don’t you feel shame or disgust?”
The woman heard them mocking her husband and tears flowing, she thought to herself, “I see this old man, whose temples are totally white like frost cladding a tree, and night and day my hopeful heart desires his early death, but my wish has yet to be fulfilled. What can I do?”
She returned to her husband and told him all that had happened, saying: “If you had a servant your wife would not have to go to the well to draw water herself. If things stay the same, I’m going to leave you!”
Her husband said, “I am poor, how can I acquire a servant?”
The woman said, “I have heard of a giver of the highest calibre named Xudana. Of vast generosity, his saving living beings used up all his kingdom resources. The King and all his officials banished him to the mountains. He has two children, beg for them and he will give them to you.”
The woman went on and on about this, and as he loved his wife and found it hard to oppose her, he conceded and went to the Shebi kingdom and at the palace gates asked, “Where is the Crown Prince?”
The guards reported this to their superiors. When the King heard he was overcome with sadness, his heart felt constricted and his innards blocked; tears flowed. After a while he spoke, “The Crown Prince was exiled precisely because of this type of person, yet they still come!”
He requested that the visitor reveal the hardships he underwent on his journey and asked his reasons for coming. He replied, “The Crown Prince’s influence and renown are praised in song far and near, thus I came a great distance to put myself at his mercy in the hope of some respite.”
The King said, “The Crown Prince’s riches have all been given away. He now lives deep in the mountains, and even his clothing and food are insufficient. What could he give you?”
He replied, “His virtue is excellent and lofty and I came from afar, exhausted myself in my yearning to meet him. I need to see his radiant countenance so I can live out the rest of my life without regret.”
The King ordered someone to show him the route the Crown Prince had taken.
On the way he encountered a hunter, and said, “You often pass through these mountains, have you seen anything of the Crown Prince?”
The hunter completely understood the reasons the Crown Prince had been banished, and agitated, he cursed saying, “Why are you asking about the Crown Prince? I’ll chop your head off if you aren’t careful!”
The brahmin shamefaced and afraid said to himself, “He will certainly kill me! I will just have to adopt an expedient to trick him!”
He said, “The King and his officials order the Crown Prince to return home and to take the throne.”
The hunter replied, “Ah! That’s wonderful!”
And he happily showed him where the prince lived.
  In the distance he saw a small hut, and the Crown Prince also saw him coming. The two children saw him and fear struck their hearts. Older and younger both said, “Our father loves giving and as he has already given away everything he had and has nothing more to give – it’s us who are going to be given away!”
Holding hands, they fled. Their mother had dug out a shelter and the hole was big enough for both of them. The two children got in and covered themselves with brushwood. They warned one another, “If father calls don’t respond!”
The Crown Prince looked up respectfully at the brahmin and bid him take a seat and placed fruit and broth before him. Having greeted him and seen to his needs, he said, “Such a long journey must have left you exhausted!”
He replied, “Coming so far, my entire body aches, and I was very hungry and thirsty. The Crown Prince has a glowing reputation – in all quarters his virtue is praised. It illuminates the lofty heights and distant places, just like Mount Tai. Who could better you among the heavenly divinities and earthbound spirits? Because I have come so far and expended all I have, I hope you can extend your generosity to this lowly creature.”
The Crown Prince said sadly, “But I have nothing left of value.”
The brahmin said, “You could give your two children to look after an old man.”
The Prince replied, “You have come such a great distance to ask for my children. I cannot refuse you!”
The Crown Prince called out to them. The siblings were frightened saying, “Our father is calling us. He wants to give us to that demon.”
Disobediently they did not respond. The Crown Prince guessed they were in the pit, lifted the brushwood and saw them. The children came out and clung to their father, trembling and weeping, wailing in distress they cried, “That is a demon! He’s not a brahmin! We have seen brahmins many times and we have never seen one who looked like this! Don’t make us a demon’s meal! Why is our mother so late back from gathering fruit? Now we will certainly perish, devoured by a demon! When our mother returns and looks for us, she will be like a cow searching for her calves, running around crazed with grief! Father, you will certainly regret this!”
The Crown Prince said, “I have been giving all my life and have never had even the slightest regret. I accede to his request, do not disobey!”
The brahmin said, “You give them to me with universal kindness, but if their mother returns she will immediately object to your great bounty and frustrate my original desire. Better we leave sooner rather than later.”
The Crown Prince said, “You came a great distance for my children - I dare not frustrate you. Quick be on your way!”
With his right hand the Crown Prince ritually washed the hands of the brahmin, while holding his children in his left about to hand them over. The brahmin said, “I am old and feeble. If your children are released, they will escape and run off to their mother, how could I catch them? Would the Crown Prince be so kind as to tie them up before presenting them to me?”
The Crown Prince held his children and allowed the brahmin to tie them up,
holding the end of the rope in his own hand. Both children threw themselves to the ground and writhed about in front of their father, wailing they cried out for their mother, saying, “Heavenly divinities, earthbound spirits, mountain and tree spirits, let our mother know what’s going on; tell her, ‘Your two children are being given away. Just leave the fruit and come and see what’s going on.’”
Their sorrow moved heaven and earth and the spirit of the mountain was so moved he created a thunderous noise for them.
At that time their mother was gathering fruits and became alarmed. She looked up at the azure sky, but saw no clouds or rain; her right eye twitched and her left armpit itched, and milk flowed from both her breasts. The mother thought about this, and said, “This is extremely strange! What will I do with the fruit? I must quickly go back and see my children. There will be other fruit!”
She gave the fruit away and returned home crazed with anxiety.
  Lord Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋) pondered the matter and declared, “The Bodhisattva’s resolve is magnificent. He wants to complete the weighty undertaking of his Great Vow, but the arrival of his wife will wreck his lofty resolve!”
He transformed into a lion and crouched in the middle of the path. The woman appealed to him saying, “You are the king of the beasts - I am also the child of kings. We both live on this mountain. I have two very young children. Morning has arrived and they have not yet eaten and must be waiting for me.”
The lion yielded to her and she continued her journey. Śakra then returned having transformed into a white wolf. The woman said exactly what she had said to the lion and the wolf also yielded. Then he transformed into a tiger, but by now the brahmin was far away so he withdrew.
  When the woman arrived, she saw the Crown Prince sitting alone. Distressed and full of dread she asked, “Why are you sitting by yourself? Where are my children? My children always wait to see me appear in the distance and come rushing over to me for fruit. They fall to the ground and then leap up again, jumping up and down and laughing joyfully saying, ‘Mama has returned! Her hungry children will eat their fill!’ Now I do not see them; have you given them away? I sit and my children stand, one to my left, one to my right. Seeing I am dusty, they compete to dust me down. Today my children did not come, and I cannot see where they are; who have you given them to? You should have told me earlier! I have prayed and made offerings to heaven and earth. However difficult it is you must tell me the truth – have you given our beautiful offspring away?  Now the children’s toys, clay elephants, oxen horses and pigs, all those beautifully made playthings lie scattered on the ground. My heart is moved with fear – I am going mad? Have they been taken by a tiger or a wolf, by a ghost or a demon, a robber or a bandit? Quickly tell me what has happened or I will die!”
The Crown Prince took some time before he spoke, “There was a brahmin who came looking for two children, who said, ‘As I grow old and decline, I need them to help me.’ So I gave them to him.”
When his wife heard these words, moved, she leapt up then fell to the ground. Writhing in extreme distress, tears coursing, she cried, “This is just as I dreamt! During the night I dreamt I met an aged, poverty-stricken brahmin who sliced off my breasts and quickly ran away clutching them. This is exactly what has come to pass!”
Grief-stricken she cried to the heavens, shaking the entire mountain. She cried, “How am I going to find my children?”
The Crown Prince observed his wife’s extreme grief, and he said to her, “You respected my original vow and the children complied out of filial devotion. My aim is to attain the Great Way and saving sentient beings is my priority and there is nothing sought which I will not give. The words of my vow were very clear, yet now you are grief-stricken and you unsettle my mind.”
His wife said, “The Crown Prince seeks the Way, but why must it be so hard? The leader of a noble family, respected by his wife and children, can do whatever he likes, how much more so when you are a ruler of men? Your vow said, ‘That which is sought will certainly be obtained’, and that accords with the universal wisdom of the Buddha.”
  Śakra and the assembled gods all discussed this saying, “The Crown Prince widens the Way by giving to all without limit. Let’s test him with his wife and see what his resolve is like!”
Śakra transformed into a brahmin and approaching the Bodhisattva, and said, “I have heard you embody the humaneness of heaven and earth, universally saving living beings by giving without opposition. Thus, I have come to appeal to your feelings. Your wife is of worthy and steadfast character, her reputation for virtue has spread far and so I have come to ask for her. Might you be willing to give her to me?”
He replied, “Very well!”
With his right hand he scooped up some water and washed the brahmin’s hands, with his left hand he led his wife forward to hand her over and accede to his request. The gods wished him long life, none did not admire his excellence. The heavens and the earth shook suddenly startling men and ghosts. The brahmin cried, “Stop! I cannot take her!”
The Crown Prince replied, “Do you think there is something wrong with this woman? I can assure you she has no bad qualities – her propriety is second to none. In fact, she is the only daughter of her royal father, and has served her husband with the utmost propriety. She does not try to avoid hardship and will take whatever clothing and food is available and will not seek out the fine and the sweet. Hardworking, capable and strong, she is very beautiful –much better looking than any others of her class. I would be delighted if you would take her – it would save me a great deal of worry!”
The brahmin said, “Your wife’s worth and diligence are exactly as you say. I respectfully accept her, but I entrust her to you. Do not give her to someone else!”
He continued, “I am the god Śakra, I am no ordinary mortal. I came to test you. You aspire to reflect the Buddha’s wisdom and that model is hard to match. Now tell me what you want and I will certainly grant your request.”
The Crown Prince said, “I want to obtain great wealth and constantly enjoy giving, being even less covetous than I am now. So I want you to induce my royal father, his officials and the people to give me an audience.”
The god Śakra said, “Very well!”
Immediately he was gone.
  The brahmin, delighted he had achieved his aim, untiringly made his way with the two children eager to bask in his wife’s admiration for the completion of his mission. These children, the ruler’s grandchildren, once so very happy in their freedom had been taken from their parents bound in ropes. Where the knots chaffed it hurt and they cried piteously for their mother, but he drove them on with a whipping. One day as the brahmin napped, the children broke free and ran away. They hid themselves in a pond and covered themselves with lotus leaves and arranged water creatures over their bodies. When he awoke, he searched and when he found them, he beat them from head to toe till blood flowed and turned the ground red. The deities took pity and released them from their bonds, curing their wounds, producing sweet fruits, and making the ground soft for them. The siblings took the fruit, and fed each other, saying, “This fruit is as sweet as that from a royal estate, and this ground is as soft as the cushions beside a ruler.”
The siblings supported each other, looking up at the sky cried out for their mother, tears flowing over their bodies. Wherever the brahmin trod the ground was perilous, with small stones and thorny brambles. The infected lacerations on his body and the soles of his feet were agony. When he saw fruit on a tree, it was either bitter or hard. While the brahmin was but skin clinging to bone, the children’s skin was just as glowing and glossy as it used to be. Arriving home, he smiled happily and announced, “I have got two servants for you, just as you directed.”
The wife looked at the children and exclaimed, “They don’t look like servants! These children look wonderful, their hands and feet smooth and pleasing; they won’t be able to endure hard work! Quickly sell them and buy ones like I asked for.”
So, in accordance with his wife’s orders, he set off to a particular kingdom, but the gods made him confused about his route, and he took the children to their native land. The common folk recognised them and all cried, “These are the children of the Crown Prince! The grandchildren of our Great King!”
Sobbing they went to the palace gates reported to the King. The King summoned the brahmin to bring the children into the palace. Everyone in the palace, of high rank and low, was choking with sobs. The King called out to them wanting to embrace them, but the children wouldn’t come to him. The King asked, “Why?”
The children said, “In the past we were grandchildren of the King, now we are servants. Should the lowly servant sit on the royal knee?”
The King asked the brahmin, “How did you get these children?”
He told him what had happened.
The king said, “How much do you want for them?”
The brahmin had not yet answered, when the grandson piped up and said, “The boy is worth one thousand silver pieces, and one hundred head of oxen; the girl is worth two thousand gold pieces, and two hundred cows.”
The King said, “The boy is older, yet cheaper; the girl younger, yet more expensive. How come?”
The boy replied, “The Crown Prince is sagely and humane, enriching the heavens and the earth equally. All-under-Heaven was happy to submit to him, just as children depend on their parents. Then this bright chart providing guidance to All-under-Heaven was taken and driven far away, expelled to the wilderness, where tigers, wolves and poisonous insects were his neighbours, eating fruit and wearing grasses, terrified by thunder and rain. His only wealth now lies in grasses and small plants, and he has been convicted, banished and cast aside. This is how I know boys are of low value. Common girls, if fair of face, will find themselves residing in the forbidden part of the palace, sleeping on cushions behind jewelled curtains wearing All-under-Heaven’s most renowned garments, eating All-under-Heaven’s tributes. This is how I know girls are valuable.”
The King said, “This eight-year-old child argues like a senior scholar. He’s even better than his father!” 
All in the palace, of high and low status, heard this admonition and cried out in sympathy.
The brahmin said, “They are worth one thousand pieces of silver, and one hundred head of each oxen and cows. Accept this offer, I will give them to you, and all will be well. If you don’t accept then you will be to blame for whatever happens next.”
The King said, “Agreed.”
He paid him that amount forthwith, and the brahmin withdrew. The King embraced his two grandchildren and they sat on his knee, the King said, “Just now you wouldn’t come to receive my embrace, why have you come so quickly now?”
They replied, “Then we were servants, now we are the King’s grandchildren.”
He said, “When you are with your father in the mountains what food do you gather for yourselves?”
The two children said, “We find ferns, vegetation and fruits for ourselves, that is all. Every day we live in amity with the wild beasts and the birds; we have absolutely no worries at all.”
  The King dispatched an envoy to invite them to return. The envoy set off, and as he passed through the mountains the trees looked up and down and bent and stretched, as if trying to perform a respectful ritual bow. The mournful cries of the birds were very affecting; “What auspicious signs are these?”, asked the Crown Prince.
His wife lying on the ground said, “Your father intends to release us from our banishment, the envoy must be on his way to invite us to return home and the deities are enhancing our happiness with auspicious signs.”
The woman had been lying on ground since her children had gone.
The envoy arrived and rising from his bow, he carried out the King’s command and announced. “The King and the Queen have nearly stopped eating and can hardly stop weeping. Their lives fade by the day and they think constantly about the Crown Prince.”
The Crown Prince looked all around him, to the left and to the right, feeling tender towards the trees and the flowing springs of the mountains, staunched his tears as he ascended the carriage.
  Since the envoy had set off the entire kingdom had been rejoicing; they fixed the roads and cleaned up and in anticipation of the Prince’s return, hung curtains, burned incense and scattered flowers. There was singing and dancing and banners and canopies were hung. The entire kingdom hastened to wish them immeasurably long lives. The Crown Prince entered the city walls, knelt and touched his head to the ground apologising for his excesses, and returned to the labours of daily life. The King gave the precious contents of the treasury to the Crown Prince, urging him to distribute it. Troubled peoples in neighbouring kingdoms pledged allegiance one after another just as the myriad watercourses return to the sea. Old enemies all sent reports to the throne declaring their vassalage and queued up to present tribute. Robbers placed value on humaneness, thieves competed to give, weaponry went into storage, and places of incarceration were destroyed. All living beings were at peace in the kingdom, and in all directions it was celebrated. They never ceased accumulating merit, and came to trust in the Thus-Come One, the One Bound by No Ties, he who has attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening, the Charioteer of the Way, the Teacher of Gods and Men, the unrivalled King of all Sages in the triple-world.
The Buddha told the bhikṣus, “I received the weighty undertaking of all Buddhas, vowing to save sentient beings. Although the suffering has been extremely bitter, now I am the unrivalled leader. The Crown Prince was born in the Tuṣita Heaven (Duoshu Tian 兜術天) after his death, and from that heaven he descended, born to King Śuddhodana (Baijing wang 白淨王) and now is me; my father the king, was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難); my wife was Gopikā (Juyi 俱夷); my son was Rāhula (Luoyun 羅云); my daughter was the mother of the arhat Zhuchi (朱遲); Śakra was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒); the hunter was Youtuoya (優陀耶 Udāya?); Accuta was Mahākāśyapa (Da Jiashe 大迦葉); the brahmin who sold the children was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達) and his wife was Devadatta’s wife Zhanzhe (旃遮, Sundarī?). In past lives I assiduously suffered innumerable times and in the end there was no fear of me infringing the Great Vow, therefore I explain the law of giving for my disciples.”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.
  Notes:
[1] The Four Equalities (si deng 四等) or Four Equal States of Mind (si deng xin 四等心) are the apramānas, four states of mind a Buddha manifests to all, later translated as the Four Immeasurable States of Mind (si wuliang xin 四無量心). They are loving-kindness (maitrī; ci 慈), compassion (karuṇā; bei 悲), sympathetic joy (muditā; xi 喜), and equanimity (upekṣā; she 捨).

[3] The Chinese of the elephant's name suggests an underlying term similar to Rājevarrdam, which is perhaps due to the tradition in some Indic versions of the story of referring to the elephant as the ""bringer of prosperity to the kingdom"" (eg raṭṭhavaḍḍhana in Jātakatthavaṇṇanā 547, where the epithet is also used of Vessantara and his father).

Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國), at his monastery in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu 祇樹) among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada (Jiguduyuan 給孤獨園). The Buddha told the bhikṣus, “In the past there was a ruler of a kingdom, his name was Hemo (和默 ‘Harmonious Silence’), who conducted himself with humaneness and impartiality, cherishing his people as if they were his own children. The Correct Law [of the Buddha] was used to govern the kingdom and the people had no discontents. The territory of the kingdom was extensive, and the commanderies and prefectures extremely numerous. The realm flourished, the five grains ripened in abundance, the kingdom experienced neither disasters nor calamities, and the life span was eighty-thousand years. Hemo, a sagely ruler, decreed that within the palace confines his royal consort, nobles, officials and attendants, and all ministers responsible for upholding the rules and regulations, should each instruct their own department to implement the Correct Law. The King always maintained a compassionate mind taking pity on living beings, saddened by the ignorance and delusion which leads to the crazed perversity that precipitates their own fall. He sought out the origins of the Way and was happy when there was nothing more to add. Feeling pity, he wanted to protect all living beings in the same manner as the King of the Gods, Śakra. No trace of malefic behaviour such as killing, stealing, and lustful dissolution, nor of inconstant, wicked, lying, or flattering speech, nor of envious, angry or deluded thought remained in his mind. [1] Showing filial obedience to his parents and love and respect all his relations, he searched out and pursued the worthy and venerated, and praised sages. He placed his trust in the Buddha, the Law and the words [2] of the śramaṇas, trusting that the good will be fortunate and the evil will meet with calamity. He wholeheartedly exerted himself in pursuit of good governance, conducting himself in accordance with of the Ten Kinds of Good Behaviour of the enlightening Law. He strongly counselled his principal wife, concubines, and even the most lowly maidservant, to venerate them as he did, and one after the other they became good. He made them known these ten all within the Four Garrisons of the kingdom, to officials and people, of high rank and low, spreading word of them and causing them to keep them in mind and put them into practice.
In the kingdom there was an impoverished man, who, unable to bear his destitute situation, misguidedly carried out a robbery. His wealthy victim caught him and informed the King who asked him, “Are you the thief?”
The thief replied, “Truly, I am.”
The king asked, “Why did you steal?”
The thief explained, “Truly I am so impoverished I have no means to support myself, so I flouted your sagely laws and walked over fire to thieve.” [3]
Dismayed, the King pitied him and praised his great sincerity, but felt ashamed and reproached himself. He sighed deeply and said, “If among my subjects there are those who hunger, it is I who starve them, if there are those who are cold; it is I who strip them bare.”
He went on, “With my power I should be able to rid the kingdom of poverty – I am responsible for the people’s joys and sorrows.”
He immediately issued a general amnesty and removed the treasures from his storehouses and distributed them to the poor. The hungry and thirsty were promptly fed and watered, the cold were clothed and the sick were given medicine; fields, gardens and residences, gold, silver and pearls, carts, horses, oxen and money, whatever they desired they received. All birds that fly and beasts that run, even down to the creepy-crawlies, they also all obtained whatever they liked – the five grains, hay, or grass.
After the King did all this giving, the kingdom flourished and the people prospered taking the right path one after the other. Those dreadful stupidities of mind fell silent and dissipated and there were no killers, robbers or dissolutes, no inconstant, wicked, lying or flattering speech, and none were envious, angry or deluded, all putting their trust in the Buddha, the Law and the śramaṇas, trusting that doing good would result in good fortune and acting wickedly would bring calamity. The entire kingdom was peaceful and happy; neither whip nor staff were utilised in punishment, enemies declared themselves vassals, weapons of war rotted in storerooms, and prisons had no inmates. The people declared that this was a good time to be alive. Gods, dragons, spirits and ghosts, all played their part in creating happiness by blessing and protecting the kingdom. Calamities completely ceased, the five grains ripened in abundance, and families held surplus. The King was uniquely happy having obtained the Five Good Fortunes: first, longevity; second, each day his countenance grew more splendid; third, his virtue perfumed the Eight Directions, the zenith and the nadir; fourth, his ability to resist disease daily grew stronger; and fifth, within his borders all were at peace and everyone was always happy.
When the King latterly came to the end of his days he was still like a strong healthy man, able to eat his fill and fall asleep quickly. All of a sudden, he ascended and was born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven (Daoli Tian 忉利天).
The people of the kingdom received with deference the ten injunctions to good behaviour and none entered the pathway of denizen of the earth-prisons, the hungry ghost or the beast, and at the end of their long lives, they all ascended to the heavens.
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “At that time King Hemo was me.”
All the śramaṇas who heard this sūtra were delighted, made obeisance to the Buddha and departed.

"《六度集經》卷3：「（一六）佛說四姓經
  聞如是：
一時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。是時[33]四姓家遭宿命殃，貧窶尤困，草衣[34]草席，菜糜自供；雖為極困，足不蹈無道之宅，手不執無道之惠，志行清淨，眾邪不能染其心。朝稟暮講，經戒不釋於口，世尊所歎，眾智所敬，雖衣食不供於身口，奉養聖眾，隨家所有菜糜草席，不[35]忽一日。諸沙門曰：「四姓貧困，常有飢色，吾等不可受彼常食。經說沙門一心守真，戒具行高，志如天金，不珍財色[36]唯經是寶，絕滅六飢故誓除饉，何耻分衛而不行乎？」共詣佛所，本末陳之。世尊默然。後日四姓身詣精舍，稽首畢一面坐。佛念諸沙門前所啟事，問四姓曰：「寧日慈施供養比丘不？」對曰：「唯然。舉門日供，但恨居貧，菜糜草席，枉屈聖賢以為默默。」眾祐曰：「布施之行，惟在四意，慈心向彼，悲心追愍，喜彼成度，護濟眾生。雖施微薄，其後所生天上人中二道為常，所願自然，眼色、耳聽、鼻香、口味，身服上衣，心皆欣懌，不懼[1]乏無也。若施葌薄，心又不悅，後得其福，福中之薄。官位七寶，得不足榮；處在薄中，心又慳儉不敢衣食，惴惴恰恰未嘗歡喜，腹飢身寒有似乞人，徒生徒死，無善以自祐也。若施以好，心不懇誠，憍慠自恃，身不[2]供恪，綺求華名，欲遠揚己。後有少財，世人空稱，以為巨億；內懼劫奪，衣常葌薄，食未甞甘，亦為空生空死。比丘未甞履其門，遠離三尊，恒近惡道。惠以好物，四等敬奉，[3]手自斟酌，存[4]意三尊，誓令眾生逢佛昇天，苦毒消滅，後世所生願無不得，值佛生天必如志願也。」[5](此章，別本在《薩和檀王經》後)」(CBETA 2023.Q1, T03, no. 152, pp. 11c19-12a23)[33] 四姓【大】，孤獨【宋】【元】【明】　[34] 草【大】，茅【宋】【元】【明】　[35] 忽【大】，忘【元】【明】　[36] 唯【大】，惟【宋】【元】【明】　[1] 乏【大】，之【宋】【元】【明】　[2] 供【大】，恭【宋】【元】【明】　[3] 手自【大】，自手【宋】【元】【明】　[4] 意【大】，憶【宋】【元】【明】　[5] 此章…後【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】","I heard it thus:
Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國), in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu 祇樹) among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada (Jiguduyuan 給孤獨園).  At that time a household of one of the Four Great Clans had encountered predestined misfortune. They had fallen on hard times and were experiencing exceptional difficulties. They wore grass clothing and slept on grass mats, reliant on their own vegetables and rice gruel. Despite experiencing these extreme difficulties, they would not set foot in a residence which did not conform with the Way, nor touch any gifts which did not conform with the Way. Their aspirations and conduct were pure and the multifarious evils could not stain their mind. At sunrise they made offerings, at sunset they discussed the teachings. The scriptures and the rules for living were never out of their mouths; they revered the World Honoured One and respected his manifold wisdom. Even though they could barely clothe and feed themselves, never a day passed where they did not make offerings of whatever they could spare from their vegetables, rice gruel and grass mats to the multitude of sagely monks . All the śramaṇas said, “This household of the Four Clans is impoverished and always look malnourished. We cannot accept their daily offerings of food. The scriptures state that śramaṇas should wholeheartedly ‘preserve the true’ and the precepts require high standards. Our ambition should be like heavenly gold; we should prize neither wealth nor beauty as only the scriptures are precious. The reason we made a vow to ‘eliminate want’ [1] was to extinguish the ‘six hungers’ [2]. Should we feel ashamed of accepting this food for alms and not do so?”
Together they went to the Buddha and explained the situation from start to finish.
The World Honoured One remained silent.
The following day a member of the clan went himself to the Buddha’s residence. When he had finished his prostrations, he sat to one side. The Buddha had in mind the matter the śramaṇas has raised previously and asked him, saying, “You give to the bhikṣus with kindness each day, do you not?”
He replied, “Of course. Our entire household gives each day only regretting that we are so poor we have only vegetables, rice gruel and grass mats to give. We insult the sagely monks by making such trifling gifts!”
The Blessed One said, “When giving only four states of mind count: a kind attitude towards others, a feeling of pity for other living beings, a delight in others being saved, and a desire to protect all living beings. Although your offerings are meagre, after doing this you will long be born into the paths of heavenly beings or men. Whatever you want will appear spontaneously, whatever form you want to see, sound you want to hear, fragrance you want to smell and flavour you want to taste; you will be clothed and your thoughts will all be happy and you need not fear lack or want. If, however, you were to give a meagre gift, but begrudged doing so, while you would obtain good fortune afterwards, but it will be but meagre good fortune. High official position and the seven precious substances will never bring enough glory to satisfy you. You will dwell in scarcity, parsimonious, not daring to clothe and feed yourself. Fearful and timid, you will never experience happiness. With a hungry belly and a cold body, you will be like a beggar, and will live and die in vain without anything good coming from your blessings. If you give something fine without sincerity, or if you are arrogant, proud or over-confident and give without respect, this is like the plain hoping for the reputation of the sumptuous. It is merely self-aggrandisement. Later there will be some small reward, the people of the world praise you, but it will be empty praise. They will assume you are hugely wealthy and you will fear they will snatch what’s yours. So, your clothing will always made of cogon grass or thin weeds and your food will never taste sweet, you will also live and die in vain; bhikṣus will never set foot across your threshold, and you will distance yourself from the Three Honoured Ones and you will always be reborn in the evil paths. If you give good things in the four respectful ways, that is scooping it up with one’s own hands, keeping in mind the Three Honoured Ones, vowing that all living beings will encounter a buddha and ascend to heaven, and that all suffering will be eliminated, then in later lives you will get whatever you want. Encountering a buddha and being born in heaven will be an inevitable result of your vow.”
  Notes: 
[1] The term ‘eliminate want’ (chujin 除饉) means to became a monk or nun.
[2] The ‘six hungers’ (liuji 六飢) is a very obscure term. Chavannes states, “Ce sont les appétits de l’œil, de l’oreille, du nez, de la bouche, du corps, de la pensée.”"
"《六度集經》卷3：「（一七）昔有梵志，名曰維藍，榮尊位高，為飛行皇帝，財難籌算，體好布施：名女上色，服飾光世，以施與人；金鉢盛銀粟，銀鉢盛金粟，澡甕盥槃四寶交錯；金銀食鼎，中有百味；[6]秦水名牛皆以黃金韜衣，其角一牛者日出四升湩；皆從犢子，織成寶服，明珠綻綴；床榻[7]幃帳，寶[8]絡光目；名象良馬，金銀鞍勒，[9]絡以眾寶；諸車華蓋，虎皮為座，彫文[10]刻鏤無好不有。自名女以下至于寶車，事事各有千八十四枚，以施與人。維藍慈惠，八方上下天龍善神無不助喜。「如維藍惠，以濟凡庶，畢其壽命無日[11]疲懈，不如一日飯一清信具戒之女，其福倍彼不可籌算。又為前施并清信女百，不如清信具戒男一飯。具戒男百，不如具戒女除饉一飯。女除饉百，不如高行沙彌一人飯。沙彌百，不[12]如沙門一人，具戒行者，心無穢濁內外清潔。凡人猶瓦石，具戒高行者，若明月珠也；瓦石滿四天下，猶不如真珠一矣。「又如維藍布施之多，逮于具戒眾多之施，不如飯溝[13]港一。溝[＊]港百，不如頻來一。頻來百，不如不還一。不還百，不如飯應真一人。「又如維藍前施及飯諸賢聖，不如孝事其親。孝者盡[14]其心無外私。百世孝親，不如飯一辟支佛。辟支佛百。不如飯一佛。佛百，不如立一剎、守三自歸，歸佛歸法歸比丘僧。盡仁不殺，守清不盜，執貞不犯他妻，奉信不欺，孝順不醉，持五戒，月六齋，其福巍巍，勝維藍布施萬種名物，及飯賢聖，甚為難算矣。「持戒不如等心慈育眾生，其福無盡也。雖為菜糜草[15]席，執三自歸，懷四等心，具持五戒，山海可[16]秤量，斯福難籌算也。」佛告四姓：「欲知維藍者，[17]我身是。」四姓聞經，心大歡喜，作禮而去。」(CBETA 2023.Q1, T03, no. 152, p. 12a23-b29)[6] 秦【大】，𤚩【元】【明】　[7] 幃【大】，帷【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 絡【大】，珞【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 絡【大】，給【宋】　[10] 刻【大】，剋【宋】　[11] 疲【大】，廢【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 如【大】，如具戒【宋】【元】【明】　[13] 港【大】＊，巷【宋】＊　[＊13-1] 港【大】＊，巷【宋】＊　[14] 其【大】，真【宋】【元】【明】　[15] 席【大】，蓆【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 秤【大】，稱【宋】【元】【明】　[17] 我身是【大】，是我身【宋】【元】【明】","In the past there was a brahmin called Velāma (Weilan 維藍). Honoured and respected he achieved high status and became a Flying Emperor [1]. Of incalculable wealth, he personified the love of giving. Women famed for their superior beauty, with garments and adornments illuminating the world with their lustre, were given away. Golden bowls brimming with silver grains, silver bowls brimming with golden grains, washing vessels inlayed with the four precious gems intertwining, gold and silver food cauldrons containing the one hundred wonderful flavours, renowned cattle from the Qin river, their horns wrapped in golden coverings, each producing four pints of milk per day and with a calf in tow, precious clothes made of patterned silks embroidered with bright pearls, bed curtains decorated with dazzling pearls and jade, famed elephants and fine horses with gold and silver saddles and bridles threaded with a multitude of jewels, carriages covered with luxuriant canopies with seats made of tiger skin, painted in bright colours and intricately engraved: there were no fine things he did not have. From the women famed for their beauty down to the bejewelled carriages he had eighty-four thousand of each and he gave them all away. Velāma’s kindness reached throughout the eight directions and from the zenith to the nadir. All the heavenly beings, dragons and good spirits rejoiced over his meritorious giving [2]. 
Even if one were to be like Velāma in kindness, and save [many] ordinary people, by [giving] daily and untiringly till the end of one’s life, the accruing good fortune cannot compare that accruing from feeding a laywoman who has taken all the precepts – it will be incalculably greater! Further, if you were to give a meal to one hundred laywomen, this cannot compare with feeding one layman who has taken all the precepts; feeding one hundred such laymen cannot compare with feeding a laywoman who has ‘eliminated want’ [and has taken the vows of a nun][3]; feeding one hundred such nuns, cannot compare with feeding one śrāmaṇera of lofty conduct; feeding one hundred such śrāmaṇeras, cannot compare with feeding one śramaṇa who puts into practice all the precepts, whose mind is clean, without filth, pure within and without. Ordinary people are like potsherds or pebbles, one of lofty conduct who has taken all the precepts is like a bright-moon pearl [4]. Potsherds and pebbles fill the Four Continents of Jambudvīpa and cannot be compared with one real pearl. Further, just as in the case of Velāma's extensive giving, even if one's giving reaches numerous monastics it cannot be compared with feeding one stream-enterer; feeding one hundred stream-enterers cannot be compared with feeding one once-returner; feeding one once-returner cannot be compared with feeding one non-returner; feeding one hundred non-returners is not as good as feeding one who responds to the true (arhat) [5]. Further, Velāma’s giving and the feeding of the virtuous sages cannot compare with serving one’s parents with appropriate filiality. The filial use their hearts to the utmost, but this does not extend beyond the private sphere. One hundred generations of filial treatment of one’s parents does not compare with feeding one pratyekabuddha. Feeding one hundred pratyekabuddhas cannot not compare with feeding one buddha. Feeding one hundred buddhas cannot compare with establishing one temple. By maintaining the Threefold Refuge oneself, taking refuge in the Buddha, the Law and the bhikṣu-saṃgha [6], [and accepting the Five Precepts:] utmost humaneness does not kill, one guarding the pure does not thieve, one maintaining chastity does not violate another’s wife, the respectful and trustworthy do not lie, and the filial do not get drunk. [7] Uphold these Five Precepts and abstain on the six fast days each month and your good fortune will be lofty. The extent to which the good fortune accrued will surpass that of Velāma’s giving of a myriad of celebrated items and that from feeding virtuous sages is incalculable. Upholding the precepts cannot compare with compassionate nurturing of all living beings with an impartial mind; the good fortune arising from this is limitless. Although you give only vegetables, rice gruel and grass mats, if you do so while maintaining the Threefold Refuge, and embodying the Four Equal States of Mind [8] and upholding all the Five Precepts, while mountains and seas can be weighed and measured, your accrued good fortune will be incalculable.
  The Buddha told the man of the Four Great Clans: “I want you to understand that Velāma was me.”
The man of the Four Great Clans listened to the scriptures and his heart was filled with great joy. He made obeisance and departed.
  Notes
[1] Flyiing Emperor (feixing huangdi 飛行皇帝) is an unusual early Chinese rendering of the term cakravartin.
[2] Zacchetti (2013, 133 n. 76) suggests, following Karashima (2010, 676), that zhuxi  助喜 is related to the Sanskrit anumodanā. 
[3] The term ‘eliminate want’ (chujin 除饉) means to became a monk or nun. On this being a term originating with Han dynasty translators An Xuan and Yan Fotiao, then taken up by translators in Wu, see Nattier 2008, 91 and 2022, 109. 
[4] It is not entirely clear what a “bright-moon” or  “full-moon pearl” 明月珠 is: Yu notes (2013 [105], 70 and notes 39 and 40) it is “jewellery that shines. According to some, it is a kind of diamond; to others, it refers to the eye of the whale.”
[5] For the term yinzhen 應真 as arhat see Nattier 2003, 213-215.
[6] I am indebted to Professor Jan Nattier for bringing to my attention the close correspondance between this passage and a corresponding passage in the Velāma Sutta of the Pāli Aṅguttara Nikāya (see Bhikkhu Bodhi trans. 2012, 1276) permitting me to correct a mistake in my translation. On the term cha 刹 see Karashima 2017.
[7] This is an example of Buddhists matching traditional Chinese moral qualities with the five lay Buddhist precepts. On this in the translations of Zhi Qian see Nattier 2008, 120-131.
[8]  The Four Equalities (si deng 四等) or Four Equal States of Mind (si deng xin 四等心) are the apramānas, four states of mind a Buddha manifests to all, later translated as the Four Immeasurable States of Mind (si wuliang xin 四無量心). They are loving-kindness (maitrī; ci 慈), compassion (karuṇā; bei 悲), sympathetic joy (muditā; xi 喜), and equanimity (upekṣā; she 捨)."

He was of imposing stature with a multicoloured coat, and his hooves and horns were uncommonly elegant. Several thousand deer submitted to his authority and joined his herd.
The ruler of the kingdom they were grazing in went hunting and the herd of deer scattered, throwing themselves off cliffs, falling into pits, dashing themselves on trees and becoming impaled on thorns; some were captured and died of their wounds – many were killed. The King of the Deer observed this and choking with sobs declared, “I am the leader of the herd. I should have assessed this tract of land carefully before leading them here. I was careless when I brought them to this place for the good grazing and now my subjects have been weakened and injured. The blame rests with me.”
He took off on his own and entered the kingdom. The people of the kingdom saw him, and they all said, “Our ruler must be endowed with the virtue of utmost humaneness - a divine deer has arrived!”
Assuming that this was an auspicious sign for the kingdom none dared stand in his way, so he came right up to the front of the palace, knelt and said to the ruler, “We lesser animals, in our desire for life, settled in your domain. Suddenly we encountered hunters and the creatures scattered. Some survived, but lost touch with the herd and others died in the disordered melee. Heaven is humane and cherishes all things; truly they should be shown mercy. I undertake to select deer daily to supply to your Grand Provisioner [1]. I humbly request you inform me of the numbers you require. I would not dare to cheat your Majesty.”
The king, thinking this extremely strange, said, “The Grand Provisioner does not use more than one deer per day. I did not know we killed so many of you. If you keep your word, I vow not to hunt anymore.”
The King of the Deer returned home and told all the deer what had transpired and explained the advantages and disadvantages of his plan. The deer respectfully followed his command and the sorted themselves into order. Each day the deer whose turn it was to die went to bid farewell to their monarch. The Deer King shed tears for each and instructed them, “Everyone dies, who can avoid it? As you proceed along your final journey keep in mind the Buddha. Let humaneness inform a compassionate heart and take care not to harbour any resentment towards others or the ruler!”
This went on day after day, but it happened that one day, the deer whose turn it was to dies was pregnant and she said, “I dare not avoid death, but I beg to be allowed to be delivered first of my child.”
The Deer King then summoned the next in line so he could take her place. But bowing low and weeping said, “I know it is inevitable I will go to my death, but I still have a day and a night left, and life is so very short. When my time comes, I will feel no regret.”
The King of the Deer could not bear to deprive him of his last day so unfairly, and so the next morning he withdrew from the herd and took himself to the Grand Provisioner. When the kitchen hands heard of this, they reported it to their superiors. The ruler asked why he was doing this and the Deer King explained the circumstances. The ruler shed sorrowful tears for him and said, “How could it be that is an animal who embodies the humaneness of Heaven and Earth and who would sacrifice themselves to save others? Such conduct is like the wide-ranging compassion of the ancients! I am the ruler of men – daily I take the lives of beings to fatten and nourish my own body. I am fond of cruelty – this behaviour is like that of a jackal or a wolf! An animal who exhibits humaneness like this has the Heaven-bestowed virtue of a sovereign.”
The King sent the deer away and he returned home. The King then issued a royal decree to the entire kingdom: if anyone attacks a deer he will be subjected to the same punishment as if the crime had been committed against a person.
After this the King and his officials saw to it that the common people observed humaneness and did not kill - their care for living things even extended to plants! The kingdom experiences a period of Great Peace [3].
The Bodhisattva, life after life, endangered his own life to save beings. His merit was perfected and his virtue was magnificent, and thus he became a Venerable Hero [2].
The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “At that time the King of the Deer was me. The ruler of the kingdom was Śāriputra (Shelifu 舍利弗).”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.

The kingdom was experiencing a serious drought and there was nothing available to feed them. She rent apart her underbelly and tried to use the flesh to save their lives. The three sons hesitated saying, “This meat smells exactly the same as our mother’s body, could it be that our mother is using her own flesh to feed us?”
The three sons were deeply moved and each said, “I would rather put my own life in jeopardy than be party to my mother’s body being harmed.”
Thereupon they closed their mouths and refused to eat. Their mother saw that they would not eat and redoubled her efforts to make them. The gods sighed saying, “This mother’s compassionate giving is difficult to match and her sons’ filial behaviour is such as is rarely seen.”
All the heavenly beings blessed them and their desires were granted.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “The mother swan was me. Her three sons were Śāriputra (Shelifu 舍利弗), Maudgalyāyana (Mulian 目連) and Ānanda (A’nan 阿難)."

He sent his old wives away as he wanted to take a blue peahen for his wife. The blue peahen would only take sweet dew [1] and fine fruit, so each day the peacock would go out to procure her some. The consort of the ruler of that kingdom was ill. She dreamt she met a peacock who told her his flesh could be used as medicine. On awakening she made known her dream and the ruler ordered hunters make haste and set out to find a peacock. The consort announced, “Whoever is able to get hold of one will have the hand of my daughter in marriage and one hundred pounds of gold.”
The kingdom’s huntsmen dispersed throughout the kingdom to search. One saw the King of the Peacocks followed by the blue peahen at the spot they regularly ate. So he then smeared the trees all around with honeyed grains, and the King of the Peacocks promptly took them to offer to his wife. The archer then smeared his own body with the grains and squatted down, still as a corpse. When the peacock tried to take the grains the man immediately grabbed him. The peacock said, “Your great exertions suggest you must be doing this for profit! If you spare my life, I will show you a mountain of gold, where you can avail yourself of unlimited treasures.”
The man said, “Our great ruler is going to give me one hundred pounds of gold and his daughter’s hand in marriage. Why should I trust you?”
And he proceeded to present him to the ruler. The peacock addressed him: “Your August Majesty embodies humaneness, none are not nourished by you. Please accept my wise advice and provide me with a cup of water and permit me to perform a compassionate incantation over it. When consumed it will cure illness straight away. And if it proves ineffective, it will not be too late to punish me.”
So the ruler followed his advice and his consort drank it. All her ailments were cured and her radiant beauty restored. It was the same for everyone in the palace. The entire kingdom praised the ruler’s wide-ranging compassion that had preserved the life of the peacock and obtained longer lives for the entire kingdom. The peacock asked, “Permit me to take myself to that large lake and say the incantation over its waters then the common folk within your borders can be cured of all their ailments. If you have any misgivings, you may beat my feet with a stick.”
The ruler said, “Very well.”
The peacock immediately said the incantation over the waters and the people of the kingdom drank it.  The deaf heard, the blind saw, the mute spoke and the hunchbacks straightened up; all ailments were cured.
Now the consort’s illness had been cured and the people of the kingdom likewise were without sickness, no one wanted any harm to befall the peacock. The peacock understood this and announced to the ruler, “Having received Your Majesty’s life enriching kindness, I repaid him by saving the lives of the citizens of your kingdom. Now my reparations are complete, I request that I might return home.”
The ruler said, “You may go.”
The peacock soared immediately up into the air and onto a tree where he continued, “In All-under-Heaven there are three stupidities.”
The ruler asked, “Which are the three?”
The peacock answered, “The first is my stupidity, the second is the hunter’s stupidity, and the third is your stupidity, Great Majesty.”
The ruler said, “Please explain!”
The peacock said, “All the buddhas have repeatedly admonished us to treat feminine beauty like fire, as it will burn you, endangering your life. I abandoned five hundred wives who served me, because I lusted after a blue peahen. In my search for food to feed her I acted like her slave, was captured by the hunter’s nets, and endangered my life. That was my stupidity. As for the hunter’s stupidity, with complete sincerity I offered him a mountain of gold, but he rejected these limitless treasures trusting your consort’s wicked deceptions, hoping to be married to her daughter. All the deranged and ignorant behaviour in this world falls into this category; we reject the buddhas’ sincere warnings and trust in demonic deceptions. In their drunken indulgence, or lascivious chaos, some cause misfortune which destroys their family. Others enter Mount Tai when they die, where their sufferings are innumerable and they yearn to return to the world of men like a featherless bird who yearns to fly high in the sky; is that not difficult? The bewitching qualities of a lascivious woman are like those of evil spirits. From the downfall of kingdoms to the destruction of individual men all stem from these, yet simpletons honour women! Of the many thousands of words the consort spoke, not one was sincere, yet the archer believed them. This is what I mean by the hunter’s stupidity. Your Majesty got a heavenly physician to rid your kingdom of disease; all the poisons were eliminated, and countenances became vigorous and splendid. Those of high rank and low happily put their trust in Your Majesty, yet you let me go! This is what I mean by the Your Majesty’s stupidity.”
  The Buddha told Śāriputra (Shelifu 舍利弗): “After this the Peacock King flew round in the eight directions with the divine medicine, giving with a compassionate heart he cured the illnesses of all living things. The King of the Peacocks was me. The ruler of the kingdom was you, Śāriputra. The hunter was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達) and the consort was Devadatta’s wife.
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.

He was celibate and never took a wife having completely extinguished lascivious desires. He lived in tranquillity in the mountainous wilderness taking no pleasure in worldly honours. His hut was built from thatch and his mat was made from weeds; spring waters and mountain fruits were what he took for sustenance. His aspirations were great and his conduct lofty; All-under-Heaven praised his virtue. The ruler requested he take up the position of Chief Minister, but the brahmin was focused on the Way and refused to take office. [1] He stayed in the mountainous wilderness for several decades. His humaneness reached all living beings and the birds and the beasts of the vicinity came to trust in him.
At that time there were four beasts: a fox, an otter, a monkey and a hare. These four beasts said, “Let us make offerings to the ascetic, calm our minds and listen to the scriptures.”
After a period of several years the mountain fruits became exhausted and the ascetic wanted to move elsewhere to a place where fruits were plentiful. The four beasts were worried and said, “Even if we had access to the most splendid scholars in the entire kingdom, this would be like having the ocean’s turbid waters – it cannot compare with one ladleful of sweet dew [2]. If the ascetic was to leave, we would no longer get to hear the sagely scriptures and how we will decline! [3] Let’s each of us, in accordance with what’s appropriate, find something to give the brahmin to eat and drink and request that he stay on this mountain in the hope that we can hear the Great Law.”
They all agreed. The monkey sought out some fruit and the fox transformed into a person and obtained a bag of grain. [6] The otter caught a fish. Each said to the ascetic, “This will do you for an entire month.”
The hare thought deeply, “What can I offer the ascetic?”
He said to himself, “Now, in life there is death. The body is but a decaying vessel, and as such will be discarded eventually; feeding ten thousand ordinary folk cannot compare with feeding one ascetic.”
Immediately he gathered some firewood and set it alight to make a blaze. He turned to the ascetic and said, “My frame, although small, can supply you with a day’s food.”
When he had finished speaking, he threw himself into the flames, but the flames did not burn him. The ascetic observed this and was moved by his actions. All the Buddhas praised his virtue and the gods compassionately tended to him. The ascetic stayed where he was and daily expounded the profound scriptures and the four beasts received instruction from him.
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas, “The brahmin was Dīpaṃkara Buddha (Dingguang Fo 錠光佛), the hare was me. The monkey was Śāriputra (Qiuluzi 秋鷺子), the fox was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難), and the otter was Maudgalyāyana (Mulian 目連).
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.

He had amassed a fortune equal to that of a kingdom. Constantly fond of relieving the poor, his kindness reached all living beings. He gave safe haven to all as the sea takes in all watercourses.
Once a friend’s son, through his wanton dissipation, had expended all his family’s assets. The wealthy man sympathised with him, and instructed him saying, “If you conduct your business in accordance with the Way your good fortune and profit will be inexhaustible. I am going to give you one thousand ounces of gold as capital.”
He replied, “I will do as you say. I would not dare to ignore your wise counsel.”
He immediately put the money to use transacting business. But by nature he was perverse and his conduct partial, and he was fond of serving ghosts and demons. His licentiousness was unbridled and through drinking and carousing he entirely dissipated his wealth again. This happened five times: each time he exhausted his wealth, and each time returned to the protection of the wealthy householder. On one occasion, there lay a dead rat on top of the rubbish heap outside the wealthy household’s gates. The householder pointed it out to him saying, “Now a good and clever man could use that dead rat to make a living and set up a household. How could one have had one thousand ounces of gold yet end up impoverished? But once again, I will give you one thousand ounces of gold.”
At that time there was a beggar, who heard this counsel from a distance, and sorrowful, was moved. He advanced as if to beg for food, but instead he took the rat, and left to follow the wealthy householder’s excellent advice. He begged all the necessary spices, mixed them, and cooked the rat with them, then sold it for two coins which he then used to begin trading in vegetables which resulted in him making more than one hundred coins. From these small beginnings his business grew and he became a wealthy man. Alone one day he reminisced, “I started out a beggar. How did I become so wealthy?”
Then he realised, and said, “It was all because a worthy wealthy man advised that young fool that I amassed this wealth. To receive his kindness and not repay would be to ‘turn one’s back on bright wisdom’!”
He made a silver table and also a golden rat. He filled the rat’s belly with renowned rarities and set it on the top of the table. Further, he garlanded its surrounds with precious things, and set out an array of sweet tasting things as a gift to the wealthy householder. He explained his reasons: “Today I repay to your heavenly nourishment.”
The wealthy man said, “How worthy you are, Sir! You were able to learn the lesson.”
He gave him his daughter’s hand in marriage and entrusted the entire household to him, saying, “You will be my successor, but you must respect the Buddha’s Three Jewels and use the Four Equal States of Mind [1] to save all living beings.”
He replied, “I will certainly cultivate the Buddha’s teachings.”
Later he became the heir of the wealthy man and the entire kingdom praised his filiality.
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas: The wealthy householder was me; the wayward son was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達). The one who got rich from the rat was the Bhikṣu Panthaka (Pante biqiu 槃特比丘) [2]. Devadatta kept in mind six hundred million chapters of my scriptures. He followed them in word, but not in deed and on death he entered the earth prisons of Mount Tai. Bhikṣu Panthaka kept in mind just one line and was able to transcend worldly existence. Now, where there are words without deeds, this is like the oil of a lamp which consumes itself to illuminate. This is the wisdom of the base man. When words and deeds support each other, this is like the bright light of the sun and moon which embraces all living beings and saves the ten thousand things. This is the bright wisdom of the great man. Action is the ground from which all emerges.
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.
  Notes:
[1] The Four Equalities (si deng 四等) or Four Equal States of Mind (si deng xin 四等心) are the apramānas, four states of mind a Buddha manifests to all, later translated as the Four Immeasurable States of Mind (si wuliang xin 四無量心). They are loving-kindness (maitrī; ci 慈), compassion (karuṇā; bei 悲), sympathetic joy (muditā; xi 喜), and equanimity (upekṣā; she 捨).
[2] As Zacchetti observed (2010 129 n27) Pante biqiu 槃特比丘 (Bhikṣu Panthaka) could refer to either of a pair of brothers, Mahāpanthaka and Cūlapanthaka. It seems more likely it is the latter being referred to here as we are told he was only able to remember one line of the Buddha’s teachings."

Her boss away and failed to send her provisions by her mealtime. By the time the food arrived and she was about to eat, a śramaṇa arrived to beg. She thought about how this person had cut off his desire and abandoned wickedness, his behaviour pure and perfect: “Providing aid to the world’s hungry cannot compare with giving a little to a true worthy who keeps the pure precepts.”
And with that she placed her entire share of food into his begging bowl and placed a lotus stem on top as an offering. The ascetic manifested his divine power and emitted rays of light. The woman exclaimed joyfully, “Truly this is one of divine sagacity! I vow to bear one hundred sons like him in future lives.”
When the woman died her spirit transmigrated and she was born a brahmin. Numinous essence concentrated in this brahmin’s urine and when a deer licked it, she immediately became pregnant. When her time came, she gave birth to a daughter and the brahmin raised her. Before reaching her teens, she was of radiant countenance and serene composure, she looked after the household and tended the fire. One day as she played with the deer, she unwittingly allowed the fire to go out. When the father returned, he was furious with her and ordered her to go out and look for fire. As the girl approached the village, on each place she trod a lotus grew. A householder with fire said, “Walk round my home three times and I will give you fire.”
The girl followed his instructions and the lotuses sprung from the ground around his house in three rows. Passers-by all stopped, amazed at this sight. Soon news of this reached the ears of the ruler of the kingdom, and the king ordered a skilful physiognomist to pronounce on what her features revealed about her worth. The physiognomy master pronounced, “She will certainly produce sagely posterity for infinite generations.”
The King ordered one of his prominent officials to propose marriage on his behalf and welcomed her with the appropriate ceremony. Her beauty was quite outstanding and none of the other palace women could compare. She conceived and when the time came for her to give birth, she produced one hundred eggs. From the empress down to the concubines, all were envious of her so they had a human-like baby carved from banana-wood and as she was giving birth, they covered her face with hair so she would not see, then smeared the secretions of childbirth over the wooden figure and showed this to the king. These evil women destroyed the King’s clear-sightedness and he was deceived into trusting them. The wicked group filled an urn full of the eggs, tightly sealed its mouth and flung it into the river waters. The King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), descended and affixed his seal to the mouth of the urn and heavenly beings protected it. It went along with the flow and came to rest like a pillar planted in the ground. The ruler of the kingdom downstream observed from his terrace the urn floating along in the water. It shone radiantly as if imbued with some divine spirit. He got hold of it and inspected it. He saw the seal of the Heavenly Sovereign, removed it and took out the one hundred eggs, and ordered one hundred of his women to cherish them and keep them warm. When the time came their bodies took shape producing one hundred boys.
Born with the wisdom of a great sage, naturally bright without receiving any instruction, their luminescent countenances more beautiful than all their peers, all possessed of fine features the likes of which are rarely seen, their strength and power equal to that of one hundred men, and their voices resonant like a lion’s roar. The king then provided his sagely heirs with one hundred white elephants, caparisoned with items made from the seven precious things and ordered them to advance against the neighbouring kingdoms. On all sides the kingdoms were subdued and all proclaimed themselves his vassals and servants. They also attacked the kingdom in which they were born. The people of this kingdom, young and old, all trembled in fear. The King asked, “Who is able to repel this enemy?”
His wife said, “Great King have no fear! Observe the direction from which the enemy advances and from which direction they will attack the city wall. Overlooking that place raise a watchtower and I will cause them to submit to Your Majesty.”
The king immediately observed from which direction they were coming and erected a watchtower. Their mother ascended and looking out, raised her voice and said, “Now, there are three great abominations: not distancing oneself from evil thus incurring two generations of calamity is the first; failing to appreciate ones’ parents and flouting the rules of filial behaviour is the second; using ones’ strength to kill ones’ parents and direct abuse at the Three Honoured Ones is the third. Those who condone these three abominations, their evil knows no bounds. Open your mouths: that you should trust what I say will now become apparent.”
The woman seized her breasts and the gods caused her milk to shoot all around into the mouths of her hundred sons. Sincerely moved as they drank the milk they felt sorrowful and cried, “This is our mother!”
Tears pouring down their necks, they advanced with their hands clasped, bowing their heads and acknowledged their error. As parent and children met for the first time none were left unmoved. The two kingdoms lived in amity, treating one another better than brothers do.
People living in all directions were joyful and everyone approved.
All the sons realised that in this world nothing is constant, that all was illusory, and they bade their parents farewell to study the Way, far from the filth of the world. Ninety-nine sons became pratyekabuddhas, and one son governed the kingdom. When his father the King died, he became ruler, and declared a general amnesty for all criminals, destroyed the jails and broke open the barriers round pools, and caused those in bondage to be released. He encouraged filial and fraternal piety and nurtured the orphaned and the lonely. He opened the treasury and gave in great quantities, giving whatever the people desired. He made the Ten Kinds of Good Behaviour the law of the land and everyone recited them. Each family produced filial sons, stūpas and monasteries [1] were established and offerings to the śramaṇas were made, scriptures were recited and the Way discussed, none spoke the four evils [2], all cruelties ceased and lifespans increased. The King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋) nourished and protected this kingdom like a parent nurturing their child.
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “The son who stayed and became king was me. The father of the king was King Śuddhodana (Baijing 白淨). The mother was Māyā (Shemiao 舍妙).”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.

He had five hundred disciples, all of whom were learned and virtuous. He embodied a fondness for giving, such that it was as if he did so to protect his own person. At that time there was a buddha in the world whose name was Sha (啑) – Thus-come, one bound by no ties, supremely and perfectly awakened –  who lead the three realms to bring about the return of their spirits to original non-being. The Bodhisattva saw the Buddha and joyfully committed himself to him, requesting that the Buddha and the monks stay for seven days at his residence so he could make offerings in accordance with the correct ceremony. The brahmin’s disciples squabbled over who would take charge of what. A young fellow, the teacher’s messenger, returned from an errand and asked what he should do. The teacher said, “Do whatever no one else has taken on.”
The boy replied, “Only the lamp has no one to tend it.”
The teacher said, “Excellent!”
The disciple filled an earthenware vessel full of sesame oil, washed to purify himself, wrapped a fine woollen band round his head, then set fire to it with his own hand. The heavenly beings, dragons and spirits observed his intense fortitude and none did not clap his hands in astonishment, exclaiming in admiration, “The era has never seen such as he! This person will certainly become a buddha!”
The Buddha thought him admirable and caused the light to penetrate the night while his head remained unharmed. The young man fixed his mind on the scriptures and swiftly attained no-thought. This continued for seven days without him flagging and without sustaining any injury. The Buddha then made a prediction: “Ultimately, after innumerable kalpas you will become a buddha and your name will be Dīpaṃkara (Dingguang錠光). Light will surround your neck and sit upon your shoulders; you will teach relief from distress and the number of beings you will save will be incalculable.”
The heavenly beings, spirits and dragons on hearing he would become a buddha, were all delighted and prostrated themselves, offering congratulation. The brahmin reflected, “If he obtains buddhahood, I will certainly obtain it too. I should receive a prediction.”
As the Buddha was about to leave, he came forward and bowed his head in obeisance and said, “Now I set out this small offering with utmost sincerity. I hope to receive my prediction.”
The Buddha told the brahmin, “When the boy achieves buddhahood then you will receive your prediction.”
When the brahmin heard he would achieve buddhahood, he was so happy he forgot himself. Henceforward he made great gifts; the hungry were fed, the cold clothed, and the sick given medicine. To things that creep and fly, scuttle and crawl was given whatever type of food they required in a timely fashion; all were saved. The kingdoms in the Eight Directions praised him as a humane father.

"《六度集經》卷3：「（二五）「昔者菩薩，為大理家，積財巨億，常奉三尊，慈向眾生。觀市覩鼈，心悼之焉，問價貴賤。鼈[6]主知菩薩有普慈之德、尚濟眾生，財富難數，貴賤無違，答曰：『百萬，能取者善，不者吾當烹之。』菩薩答曰：『大善！』即雇如直，持鼈歸家，澡護其傷，臨水放之。覩其[7]遊去，悲喜誓曰：『太山餓鬼眾生之類，世主牢獄早獲免難，身安命全如爾今也。』稽首十方，叉手願曰：『眾生擾擾，其苦無量，吾當為天[8]為地，為旱作潤，為漂作筏，飢食渴[9]漿，寒衣熱涼，為病作醫，為冥作光；若有濁世顛倒之時，吾當於中作佛度彼眾生矣。』十方諸佛皆[10]善其誓，讚曰：『善哉！必獲爾志。』「鼈後夜來[11]齕其門，怪門有聲，使出覩鼈，還如事云。菩薩視之，鼈[12]人語曰：『吾受重潤，身[13]體獲全，無以答[14]潤。蟲水居物知水盈虛，洪水將至必為巨害矣。願速嚴舟，臨時相迎。』答曰：『大善！』明晨詣門，如事啟王。王以菩薩宿有善名，信用其言：『遷下處高。』時至鼈來曰：『洪水[15]至，可速下載，尋吾所之，可獲無患。』船尋其後，有蛇趣船，菩薩曰：『取之。』鼈云：『大善！』又覩漂狐，曰：『取之。』鼈亦云：『善。』又覩漂人搏頰呼天，哀濟吾命，曰：『取之。』鼈曰：『慎無取也，凡人心偽，尠有終信，背恩追勢，好為兇逆。』菩薩曰：『蟲類爾濟，人類吾[16]賤，豈是仁哉？吾不[17]忍也。』於是取之。鼈[18]曰：『悔哉！』遂之豐土。鼈辭曰：『恩畢請退。』答曰：『吾獲如來、無所著、至真、正覺者，必當相度。』鼈曰：『[19]大善！』鼈退，蛇狐各去。「狐以穴為居，獲古人伏藏紫磨名金百斤，喜曰：『當以報彼恩矣。』[20]馳還曰：『小蟲受潤，獲濟微命。蟲穴居之物，求穴以自安，獲金百斤，斯穴非塚非家非劫非盜。吾精誠之所致，願以貢賢。』菩薩深惟：『不取徒[21]捐，無益於貧民；[22]取以布施，眾生獲濟，不亦善乎！』尋而取之。漂人覩焉，曰：『分吾半矣。』菩薩即以十斤惠之。漂人曰：『爾掘塚劫金，罪[23]福應柰何？不半分之，吾必告有司。』答曰：『貧民困[24]乏，吾欲等施；爾欲[25]專之，不亦偏乎？』漂人遂告有司，菩薩見拘，無所告訴，[＊]唯歸命三尊，悔過自責，慈願：『眾生早離八難，莫有怨結如吾今也。』「蛇狐會曰：『奈斯事何？』蛇曰：『吾將濟之。』遂銜良藥開關入獄。見菩薩狀，顏色有損，愴而心悲，謂菩薩言：『以藥自隨，吾將齚太子，其毒尤甚，莫能濟者。賢者以藥自聞，[A1]傅[26]則愈矣。』菩薩默然。蛇如所云，太子命將殞，王令曰：『有能濟茲，封之相國，吾與參治。』菩薩上聞，[A2]傅之即[27]愈。王喜問所由，囚人本末自陳。王悵然自咎曰：『吾闇甚哉！』即誅漂人，大赦其國，封為[28]國相，執手入宮，並坐而曰：『賢者說何書？懷何道？而為二儀之仁，惠逮眾生乎？』對曰：『說佛經，懷佛道也。』王曰：『佛有要決？』曰：『有之。佛說四非常，[29]在之者，眾禍殄，[30]景祐昌。』王曰：『善哉！願獲其[31]實。』曰：『乾坤終訖之時，七日竝[32]列巨海都索，天地烔然，須彌崩壞，天人鬼龍、眾生身命，霍然燋盡。前盛今衰，所謂非常矣。明士守無常之念，曰天地尚然，官爵國土，焉得久存？得斯念者，乃有普慈之志矣。』王曰：『天地尚[33]然，豈況國土？佛說非常，我心信哉。』「理家又曰：『苦之尤苦者，王宜知之。』王曰：『願聞明[34]誡。』曰：『眾生識靈微妙難知，視之無形，聽之無聲，弘也天下，高也無蓋，汪洋無表，輪轉無際。然飢渴于六欲，猶海不足[35]于眾流，以斯數更太山燒煮諸毒眾苦；或為餓鬼，[36]洋銅沃口役作太山；或為畜生，屠割剝裂，死輙更刃，苦痛無量。若獲為人，處胎十月，臨生急[37]笮，猶索絞身，墮地之痛猶高隕下，為風所吹若火燒己，溫湯洗之[38]甚沸銅自沃，手[39]葌摩身猶刃自剝，如斯諸痛[＊]甚苦難陳。年長之後，諸根竝熟，首白齒隕，內外虛耗，存之心悲，轉成重病，四大欲離，節節皆痛，坐臥須人，醫來加惱。命將欲終，諸風竝興，截筋碎骨，孔竅都塞。息絕神逝，尋行所之。若其昇天，天亦有貧富貴賤，延算之壽，福盡罪來，下入太山、餓鬼、畜生，斯謂之苦。』王曰：『善哉！佛說苦要，我心信哉！』「理家又曰：『夫有必空，猶若兩木相鑽生火，火還燒木，火木俱盡，二事皆空。往古先王宮殿臣民，今者磨滅不覩所之，斯亦空也。』王曰：『善哉！佛說空要，我心信哉！』「理家又曰：『夫身地水火風矣，強為地，軟為水，熱為火，息為風。命盡神去，四大各離，無能保全，故云非身矣。』王曰：『善哉！佛說非身，吾心信哉！身且不保，豈況國土乎？痛夫我先王，不聞無上正真、最正覺非常苦空非身之教矣。』「理家曰：『天地無常，誰能保國者乎？[1]胡不空藏，布施[2]貧飢之人乎？』王曰：『善哉！明師之教快哉！』即空諸藏[3]而布施貧乏，鰥寡孤兒令之為親為子，[4]民服炫[5]煌，貧富齊同，舉國欣欣，含笑[6]且行，仰天歎曰：『菩薩神化乃至於茲乎？』四方歎德，遂致太平。」佛告諸沙門：「理家者，是[7]吾身[8]也。國王者，彌勒是。鼈者，阿難是。狐者，[9]鶖鷺子是。蛇者，目連是。漂人者，調達是。菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 15a16-16a27)[6] 主【大】，生【明】　[7] 遊【大】，游【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 為【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 漿【大】，飲【宋】【元】【明】　[10] 善【大】，喜【明】　[11] 齕【大】，齚【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 人【大】，又【宋】【元】【明】　[13] 體【大】，得【宋】【元】【明】　[14] 潤蟲水居【大】，潭蟲鱉水居之【宋】【元】【明】　[15] 至【大】，至矣【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 賤【大】，賊【宋】　[17] 忍【大】，忍為【宋】【元】【明】　[18] 曰【大】，王【宋】【元】，云【明】　[19] 大【大】，太【元】　[20] 馳【大】，狐【宋】【元】【明】　[21] 捐【大】，損【宋】【元】【明】　[22] 取【大】，可【宋】【元】【明】　[23] 福【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[24] 乏【大】，者【宋】【元】【明】　[25] 專【大】，奪【宋】【元】【明】　[＊46-1] 唯【大】＊，惟【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[A1] 傅【CB】【麗-CB】，傳【大】(cf.

Looking round the market he saw a turtle for sale and feeling sorry for him asked how much he cost. The stallholder, knowing the Bodhisattva was possessed of the virtue of universal kindness, that he placed a high value on helping living beings, and that he had wealth such as was difficult to quantify, knew no objection would be raised whatever price was asked, so replied, “One million. If you can pay that, great, but if not, he’s destined for my pot!”
The Bodhisattva replied, “Very good!”
He promptly paid the price and, turtle in hand, he returned home. He washed and tended the turtle’s wounds then took him to the shore and released him. As he watched him swim away, he felt sadness mingled with joy and expressed this aspiration: “May all beings incarcerated in the earth-prisons of Mount Tai, hungry ghosts, and all living beings soon gain release from their difficulties, their lives saved as yours has just been.”
Having touched his head to the ground in the Ten Directions, with hands clasped he vowed, “For living beings in all their chaos, whose suffering is without measure I will be their heaven and their earth, moisture for the parched, a raft for those adrift. The hungry will be fed and the thirsty given broth, the cold will be clothed and the hot will be cooled. I will treat the sick and illuminate the benighted. May I appear in the midst of corrupt and chaotic times as a buddha to save living beings.”
The Buddhas of the Ten Directions all approved of his vow and praised him saying, “Excellent! You will certainly achieve your goal.”
Sometime later the turtle came and gnawed at the householder’s door. Thinking it odd that such a sound should be coming from the door his servant went out, saw the turtle and returned to report what he had seen. The Bodhisattva saw him and the turtle addressed him in the language of men, “I received an important benefit from you – you allowed me to live. I have no way of repaying you. But we water-dwelling creatures understand the ebb and flow and know that a flood is coming which will certainly cause great harm. I hope you will swiftly ready the boat so we can meet when the time comes.”
He replied, “Very good!”
At first light he went to the gates of the palace and reported this to the ruler. The King, knowing the Bodhisattva’s well-established good reputation, trusted what he said and moved from a low-lying place to somewhere higher. When the time came the turtle arrived and said, “The floods are coming! Quickly board your boat! Follow me and you will avoid harm.”
The boat followed the turtle. There was a snake who quickly approached the boat, and the Bodhisattva said, “Grab him!”
The turtle replied, “Very good!”
He also observed a fox floating along and the Bodhisattva cried, “Grab him!”
The turtle once again replied, “Will do!”
He also saw a man floating along striking, at his face and imploring heaven to take pity and save him. The Bodhisattva said, “Grab him!”
The turtle said, “Under no circumstances! The hearts of ordinary men are false, it is extremely rare to come across one who can be trusted, they turn their back on kindness in their pursuit of power and are fond of making trouble.”
The Bodhisattva said, “You assist the lower animals yet urge me to treat humankind as of little worth, how is that humane? I cannot bear to act in this way.”
Thereupon he grabbed the man. The turtle said, “You will regret this!”
The turtle led him to a fertile spot and bade him farewell saying, “I have repaid your kindness. Might I take my leave?”
The Bodhisattva replied, “When I have achieved buddhahood, am bound by no ties, and have attained the supreme, perfect awakening, I will certainly deliver you.”
The turtle said, “Very good!”
The turtle left and the snake and fox each went their separate ways. The fox made his home in a cave where he found one hundred pounds of renowned ‘purple-polished’ pure gold hidden there by men of ancient times. Joyfully he said, “I will use this to repay the kindness shown me!”
He hastened back to the Bodhisattva and said, “This lowly creature received nourishment and assistance from you which saved my life. Cave-dwelling animals such as myself seek out caves to protect themselves and in mine I found one hundred pounds of gold. This cave is not a tomb, nor a home; the gold is neither the proceeds of robbery nor theft: it was my utmost sincerity that brought it to me and I want to bestow it on Your Honour.”
The Bodhisattva thought deeply, “If I do not accept this follower’s donation it will be of no use to poor folk, but if I take it and distribute it living beings will be saved, wouldn’t that be wonderful!”
He followed him and took possession of it.  The person who had been rescued while floating in the floodwaters saw this and said, “Give me half!”
The Bodhisattva immediately gave him ten pounds. The person he had rescued said,
“You dug out a tomb and stole this gold, should you benefit from proceeds of crime? If you don’t give me half, I will report you to the authorities!”
He replied, “The poor folk are in difficulties I want to distribute it equally. You want it all, is that not unfair?”
The rescued man then reported him to the authorities and the Bodhisattva was arrested. There was no one he could appeal to so he just surrendered himself to the Three Honoured Ones, blaming himself for his error. He compassionately expressed the following desire, “I wish that all living beings will soon be distanced from the Eight Difficulties, and that none are the victims of pent-up fury such as I was subjected to today.”
The snake and the fox met and discussed the situation saying, “What can we do about this?”
The snake said, “I will save him.”
And thereupon, holding some good medicine in his mouth, the snake opened the gate and entered the prison. He saw the state the Bodhisattva was in, his countenance diminished, so sorrowful and sad, and he said to the Bodhisattva, “Keep this medicine about your person, I will bite the Crown Prince and my venom is extremely poisonous so no one will be able to save him. Your Honour will make known that you have the antidote – apply it, and he will be cured.”
The Bodhisattva remained silent. The snake did as he said he would and when the Crown Prince’s life was in danger the King issued a decree which stated, “If there is anyone able to save him, I will make him prime minister and we will rule side by side.”
The Bodhisattva sent a message to the King, applied the antidote and the prince was cured. The King joyfully asked how this had come about and the prisoner told him the story from start to finish. The King was upset and reproached himself saying, “I have been extremely stupid!”
Promptly he sentenced the rescued man to death, then issued a kingdom-wide amnesty. [1] He appointed the Bodhisattva prime minister and entered the palace hand in hand with him where they sat side by side. He said, “Whose writings does Your Honour favour and which Way do you embrace?  Does it extend the humaneness of the Two Powers [2] bringing kindness to all living beings?”
The Bodhisattva replied, “I favour the Buddha’s scriptures and I embrace the Buddhist Way.”
The king said, “Do the Buddha’s teachings contain some distinguishing tenet?”
The Bodhisattva answered, “It does. The Buddha teaches the Four Impermanents [3] and through these all calamities are extirpated and great blessings flourish.”
The King said, “Excellent! I want to obtain his truth.”
The Bodhisattva said, “When the time comes for heaven and earth to end, for seven consecutive days the great oceans will recede and heaven and earth will blaze in flames. Mount Sumeru (Xumi 須彌) will collapse and heavenly beings, spirits, dragons and all living beings will quickly die, consumed by fire. What flourished previously declines today, this is known as being ‘impermanent’. Perspicacious scholars keep impermanence in mind and realise that if this will happen to heaven and earth, how could one’s rank and kingdom endure? Keeping this in mind, they aspire to the practice of universal kindness.”
The King said, “If this will happen to Heaven and Earth how much more likely will it happen to a kingdom? The Buddha explained impermanence and I trust his explanation.”
The rich man also said, “Your Majesty ought to understand suffering in its most extreme form.”
The King said, “I want to hear your wise counsel.”
The Bodhisattva said, “The spirit of living beings is subtle and difficult to understand; look, it has no form, listen, it makes no sound, it is as broad as the entire earth, and reaches so high nothing can cover it. Vast and unbounded it circulates unendingly from one life to the next, yet it hungers and thirsts with the Six Desires [4] just as the all the watercourses flowing into it are never enough to satisfy the oceans. Because of these innumerable desires they roast time and again in the earth prisons of Mount Tai, suffering various cruelties and all kinds of miseries. Some become hungry ghosts, molten copper poured into their mouths as they labour in the earth-prisons of Mount Tai; some become domestic animals, cleaved to pieces by butchers until they are dead then once again they are knifed and suffer measureless agonies. If you get to be a person, after ten months in the womb on the verge of being born suddenly you are forced through a narrow space as if a large rope binds your body, experiencing the agonies of being born as you fall to the ground is as if from a great height. The wind blowing over you feels like being burnt by fire, the warm water in which you are washed feels like being sprinkled with boiling copper, and the hands and grasses which caress your body feel as if you are being flayed with a blade. All these bitter sufferings are difficult to describe. Once you grow old, your roots ripen simultaneously: your head turns white and your teeth fall out. All has gone to waste, both inside and out, and all that remains is sorrow. Without respite serious illnesses develop, the Four Great Elements are about to disperse and each joint is painful. Whether sitting or lying down you need help from others, and the doctor comes to add to your worries. As your life is about to reach its end the winds of sickness arise simultaneously, severing your joints and breaking your bones, blocking all your orifices. Your breath stops and your spirit departs as if soaring skywards. Even the heavens have the poor and the wealthy, the valued and the distained. You live until your good fortune runs out and then your crimes come to the fore and you descend and experience the sufferings of beings in the earth-prisons of Mount Tai, as a hungry ghost, or an animal.”
The King said, “Excellent! The Buddha explained suffering and I trust in his explanation!”
The wealthy householder also said, “Now, there is certainly ‘emptiness’. As when two sticks are rubbed together to produce fire, when the fire burns up the wood, both wood and fire are gone: the two things are empty. Royal households and their subjects of ancient times have now been obliterated and you cannot see where they have gone, – this is similarly emptiness.”
The King said, “Excellent! The Buddha explained emptiness and I trust his explanation!”
The wealthy householder also said, “Now the body comprises the Four Great Elements, earth, water, fire, and wind; strength is earth, weakness is water, heat is fire and breath is wind. When life comes to an end and the spirit departs, the Four Great Elements all leave, and there is nothing that can preserve them, thus he talks of no-self.”
The King said, “Excellent! The Buddha explained no-self and I trust his explanation! The body cannot be protected, how much less can territory? How sad that my predecessors did not hear about the supreme, perfect awakening, the teaching of impermanence, suffering, emptiness and no-self.”
The wealthy householder said, “Heaven and earth are impermanent, who can preserve his kingdom? Why not empty your storehouse and give to the poor and hungry?”
The King said, “Very Well! I will put the perspicacious teacher’s doctrines into effect without delay!”
Then he promptly emptied all his stores and distributed the contents to the needy and ordered that widows, widowers and orphans be treated as if they were his own parents and children. The clothes of the common people were radiant; rich and poor were equal. The entire kingdom was happy and smiled as they went about their business. Looking heavenward they exclaimed, “The Bodhisattva’s divine conversion has caused this!”
The four quarters praised his virtue and the kingdom experienced a period of Great Peace [5]
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “The wealthy householder was me, the ruler of the kingdom was Maitreya (Mile彌勒. The turtle was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難), the fox was Śāriputra (Qiuliuzi 鶖鷺子), the snake was Maudgalyāyana (Mulian 目連) and the floating man was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.

"《六度集經》卷3：「（二六）「昔者菩薩為沙門行，恒處山林，慈心悲愍，眾生長苦輪轉三界，何以濟之？靖心思惟，索道弘[10]原，當以拯眾。而衣有虱，身痒心擾，道志不立，[11]手探尋之即獲虱矣。中心愴然，求以安之。正有[12]獸骨，徐[13]以置中矣。虱得七日之食，盡乃捨邁。展轉生死，菩薩得佛，經緯教化。」時，天大雪絕[14]行路人，國有理家請佛并數千比丘，供養七日。厥心肅穆，宗室僉然，而雪未晞。佛告阿難：「勅諸沙門皆還精舍。」阿難言：「主人恭肅，厥心未墮，雪盛未息，分衛無處。」世尊曰：「主人意訖，不復供惠也。」佛即引[15]邁，沙門翼從還于精舍。明日世尊告阿難：「[16]汝從主人分衛。」阿難奉教而行，造主人門。門人覩之，無問其所以也。有頃迴還，稽首長跪，如事啟焉。又質其[＊]原，「彼意無恒，何其疾乎？」佛即為具說如上。又曰：「阿難！吾以慈心濟虱微命，惠之朽[17]骨七日之食，今獲供養盡世上獻。宿命施恩，恩齊七日，故其意止，不復如前也，豈況慈心向佛逮沙門眾？持戒清淨無欲高行，內端己心，表以慈化，恭惠高行比丘一人，踰施凡庶累劫盡情也。所以然者？比丘擁懷佛經，有戒、有定、有慧、解[18]脫、度知見種，以斯五德慈導眾生，令遠三界萬苦之禍矣。」阿難曰：「遇哉斯理家！面獲慈養如來、無所著、正真道、最正覺、道法御、天人師，并諸沙門，或有溝[19]港、頻來、不還、應真，或有開士，建大弘慈將導眾生者乎！斯福難量，其若海矣；難稱，其猶地也。」佛言：「善哉！阿難！真如所云。佛時難遇，經法難聞，比丘僧難得供養，如漚曇華時一有耳。」佛說如是，比丘歡喜，稽首承行。菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是。」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, p. 16a28-c2)[10] 原【大】＊，源【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[11] 手探【大】，掬手【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 獸【大】，狩【宋】　[13] 以【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[14] 行路【大】，路行【宋】【元】【明】　[15] 邁【大】，道【元】【明】　[16] 汝【大】，爾【宋】【元】【明】　[＊10-1] 原【大】＊，源【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[17] 骨【大】，髓【宋】【元】【明】　[18] 脫【大】，脫有【宋】【元】【明】　[19] 港【大】，巷【宋】","In former times the Bodhisattva was living as a śramaṇa, constantly dwelling in the mountains and forests. Kind-hearted and compassionate, he wondered how he could save living beings from enduring suffering as they circle through life after life in the Three Realms. He calmed his mind and considered how to find a way to the great origin that he could use to save beings [1]. But somewhere in his clothes there was a louse and an itch made him lose concentration and his resolve faltered. He searched for the louse with his hand and soon found it. Pitying the creature, he looked for a place to safely set it down. Right beside him there was an animal bone and he slowly put it down. The louse found seven days’ worth of food there and when he finished, he left.
Having passed through many lives and deaths the Bodhisattva attained buddhahood and he taught and converted using the correct principles. At that time there had been a heavy snowfall that cut off the road to travellers. The kingdom had a wealthy householder who had invited the Buddha and one thousand bhikṣus so he could make offerings to them for seven days. He was solemn and respectful as were the rest of his clan, but even though the snow had not yet dissipated the Buddha told Ānanda, “Order that all the śramaṇas return to our monastery.”
Ānanda said, “The host is serious and solemn and remains attentive to us. The snow is heavy and has not let up. There is nowhere else for the monks to beg for food!”
The World Honoured One said, “The host’s intention has been fulfilled; he will not give any more offerings.”
The Buddha thereupon set off to return to their residence the śramaṇas at his side. The next day the World Honoured One told Ānanda, “Go and beg for food from yesterday’s host.”
Ānanda did as he was bidden and arrived at the host’s gate. The gatekeepers saw him but did not ask him why he had come.  After a while he returned, touched his head to the ground before the Buddha then kneeling up reported what had happened. He also asked the reason for this saying, “His intent was inconsistent; why did he change his attitude so quickly?”
The Buddha then told him what had happened in the past as recounted above.
He went on, “Ānanda! In my compassion I saved the life of a louse and gave him a mouldering bone that provided him with seven days’ food. Now we have received the offerings this has exhausted the merit from my past gift. It was pre-destined that he should show us favour, but it was complete after seven days, and so his resolve to give came to an end and was no longer as it had been previously. How much more will be the benefit from showing compassion towards the Buddha and a group of śramaṇas than that obtained from giving an old bone to a louse? We maintain the pure rules, have no desire, and are of lofty conduct. Within, we correct our own minds, and without, we transform others with our compassion. To give respectfully to one bhikṣu of lofty conduct will be more efficacious than giving any amount to an ordinary man for many kalpas. Why? Because the bhikṣu concentrates on the Buddha’s teachings, follows the precepts, practices meditation, obtains wisdom, achieves liberation, and can save those who have understanding. Using these Five Virtues he compassionately guides living beings and causes them to distance themselves from the misfortunes of the Triple World’s myriad sufferings.”
Ānanda said, “What a fortunate encounter this householder had! He got the opportunity to compassionately tend in person to the Thus-Come One, one bound by no ties, one who had experienced the supreme, perfect awakening, a Charioteer of the Dharma and Teacher of Gods and Men. And the śramaṇas, some became stream-enterers, once-returners, non-returners, or Worthy True Ones (arhats), and some became Enlightening Heros (bodhisattvas) who advocate great compassion and will guide living beings! This good fortune is as difficult to measure as the sea! As difficult to weigh as the earth!”
The Buddha said, “Excellent! Ānanda! It is true what you have said. It is difficult to encounter a buddha, it is hard to hear the scriptures preached, and the opportunity to nurture bhikṣu-saṃgha is hard to come by; like an udumbara flower [2], these opportunities appear just once in an eon.”
The Buddha spoke like this and the bhikṣus were very happy, they touched their heads to the ground and continued with their practice.
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, limitless practice of giving is like this.

"《六度集經》卷4：「（二七）「昔者菩薩為清信士，所處之國其王行真，勸導臣民令知三尊，執戒奉齋者[26]捐賦除役；黎庶巨細見王尚賢，多偽善而潛行邪。王以佛戒[27]觀察民操，有外善內穢，違佛清化，即權令而勅曰：『敢有奉佛道者罪至棄市。』訛善之徒靡不釋真，恣心從其本邪。菩薩年耆，懷正真弘[28]影之明，聞令驚曰：『釋真從邪獲為帝王，壽齊二儀富貴無外，六樂由心，吾終不為也。雖一飡之命，得覩三尊至真之化，吾欣奉之。懷俗記籍萬億之卷，身處天宮極天之壽，而闇於三尊，不聞佛經，吾不願也。稟佛之言，即有戮死之患，吾甘心焉。經云：「眾生自投三塗，獲人道難，處中國難，六情完具難，生有道國難，與菩薩親難，覩經信之難，貫奧解微難，值高行沙門清心供養難，值佛受決難。」吾宿功著，今覩佛經、獲奉三寶，若值無道葅醯之酷、湯火之[1]戾，終不釋正從彼妖蠱也。』「王命有司廉察違命者，戮之市朝，廉人見菩薩志固不轉，奉事三尊至意不虧，即執之以聞。王曰：『戮之於市。』陰使人尋聽察其云。菩薩就死，誡其子曰：『乾坤始興有人之來，眾生處世，以六情亂行甚於狂醉，尠覩三尊，導清明化也。爾幸知法，慎無釋之。夫捨佛法之行，而為鬼妖之偽者，國喪必矣。吾寧捨身，不去真也。王今悖誤，爾無從焉。』廉者以聞。王知行真，即欣而請之，執手昇殿曰：『卿真可謂佛弟子者矣。』拜為國相，委任治政，捨佛清化之[2]疇者，復其賦役，於是國境莫[3]尚為善。」佛告諸沙門：「時國王者，彌勒是也。清信士者。吾身是也。菩薩執志度無極行持戒如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 16c15-17a18)[26] 捐【大】，損【元】【明】　[27] 觀察【大】，察觀【宋】【元】【明】　[28] 影【大】，景【元】【明】　[1] 戾【大】，厄【元】【明】　[2] 疇【大】，儔【宋】【元】【明】　[3] 尚為【大】，不尚【元】【明】","In former times the Bodhisattva was a layman. The ruler of the kingdom where he resided lived in accordance with the Truth. He encouraged his officials and subjects to become acquainted with the Three Honoured Ones, commuted taxes and excused from labour duties those who upheld the Buddhist rules and respected the fast days. The common folk, regardless of rank, seeing that the King revered the worthy [1] for the most part merely pretended to be good and kept their wickedness hidden. The King evaluated the peoples’ commitment to the Buddha’s rules, and saw there were those who, while outwardly looked good, inwardly were sullied and transgressed against the Buddha’s pure teachings. Promptly, in order to assess who was sincere in their beliefs, he issued a proclamation which stated: “Anyone daring to uphold the Buddha’s Way will be executed in the marketplace.”
Of those ‘followers’ whose goodness was fake none did not abandon the Truth and follow their originally wicked inclinations.
The Bodhisattva was of advanced years, and he cherished the Correct Truth of the Buddha and the effects of his illuminating wisdom. He heard the order which frightened him and he said, “Even were I to become monarch, live as long as the Two Powers [2], have unlimited wealth and status, able to indulge in the Six Pleasures whenever I desired right to the end of my life, I would not abandon the true and follow the wicked. And even if my life were to last no longer than a mealtime, as long as I got to observe the Three Honoured Ones and hear the teachings of consummate truth, I would continue to serve them joyfully. Were I given the opportunity to embrace secular writings in millions of volumes, and live in the Celestial Palace to the age a deva attains in the highest of the heavens, yet remain ignorant of the Three Honoured Ones and not hear the Buddhist scriptures, I would not be willing. If on accepting the words of the Buddha, I was immediately put to death, I would be content. The scriptures state, ‘Living beings consign themselves to the Three Mires [3]; to obtain human birth is difficult, to be born in a central kingdom is difficult, to be born with the six sense faculties intact is difficult, to be born in a kingdom where the Way is present is difficult, and to come close to a Bodhisattva is difficult, to encounter the scriptures and have faith is difficult and to penetrate the abstruse and understand the minute is difficult, to encounter a śramaṇa of lofty conduct and make offerings to him with a pure heart is difficult, and to encounter a Buddha and receive a prediction of future Buddhahood is difficult [4].’ My past lives were meritorious and now I have seen Buddhist scriptures and I have been able to pay my respects to the Triple Gem.  Even if I were to encounter the savagery of being minced and pickled, or the cruelty of being boiled and roasted, ultimately I will not relinquish the correct and be deluded by the wicked.”
The King ordered his officials to investigate those who had flouted his decree and see to it that they be executed in the marketplace. Those investigating saw the Bodhisattva’s resolve remained firm and unwavering. He had continued to serve the Three Honoured Ones his determination undiminished, so they seized him and reported this to the King, who ordered, “Execute him in the marketplace!”
In secret the King dispatched someone to investigate what the old man would say. As he was being led to his death, the condemned man cautioned his son, “Since the beginnings of Heaven and Earth and the arrival of people, sentient beings living in the world have been thrown into chaos by the Six Senses that have made their behaviour akin to extreme drunkenness; few have paid any attention to the Three Honoured Ones and been led to purity through the illuminating teachings. You are fortunate to know of the Buddha’s Law, be cautious and do not relinquish it. For if you abandon the conduct required by the Buddha’s Law and act like one of these wicked fakes, the demise of the kingdom is assured. I would rather give up my body than depart from the True. The King’s order was a perverse error, do not follow it!”
The investigator reported this. The King knew his behaviour accorded with the True and was delighted and promptly requested he come to him.  The King took his hand and ascended with him to the throne hall and announced, “You, sir, truly deserve to be called a disciple of the Buddha!”
He appointed that man to the office of Chief Minister and entrusted to him the task of implementing good government. Those who had relinquished the Buddha’s pure teachings once again had to pay taxes and do labour service, and from then on there was no one within the boundaries of the kingdom who did not revere doing good.
  The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “At that time the ruler of the kingdom was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒). The layman was me.”
  The Bodhisattva’s resolute, limitless practice of obedience to the rules is like this.

To those three he constantly surrendered himself and took every opportunity to save living beings through his all-pervading kindness. He had vowed to obtain Buddhahood and to deliver all beings. He led a herd of five hundred elephants and at that time had two wives. The elephant king came across an incredibly beautiful lotus flower in a pool and gave it to his principal wife. She took the flower and said happily, “How could this flower have bloomed in such icy cold?”
The lesser wife, greedy and envious, angrily vowed, “When I get the chance I’m going to kill you with the potent poison of the Zhen bird [1]!”
So angry was she that her life force congealed and she dropped dead.
Her soul transformed into the daughter of an important noble family and her gorgeous countenance surpassed all others. Her understanding of strategy was far-reaching and penetrating, and she had extensive learning on both the past and the present. Looking up, she observed the patterns of the heavens and understood the sequence of prosperity and decline. The King heard of her attributes and proposed she become his wife. On arrival, straight away she made known her opinions on matters relating to the governance of the state and her understanding was in accord with the loyal ministers. The King delighted in, and respected, her and would always go along with her advice. But one day his wife said, “I dreamed of a six-tusked elephant and I want his tusks for a low table hung with pendants. If the king does not bring this about, I will die!”
 The king said, “Don’t talk nonsense! If people hear they will laugh at you!”
But his wife talked incessantly about this and the King became very worried and instigated a discussion with four officials telling them about the dream, pretending it had been his own. He asked, “In ancient times or today, has there ever been such an elephant?”
One official replied, “No, never.”
Another official said, “Your Majesty did not dream this dream.”
Another said, “I have heard of such a thing, but very far away.”
Another said, “If we could get it, Śakra would also be come.” [2]
The four officials were sent by imperial decree to the four quarters to seek out master archers to ask them. The southern master said, “My late father always used to say such an elephant exists, but that it was far away and difficult to get to.”
The official reported saying, “This person knows of such an elephant.”
The King immediately received him, and his wife said to the archer, “Go due south for a thousand miles. When you get to the mountains enter them, travel for about two days, and you will arrive at the place where the elephant lives. By the side of the road dig a pit, shave off your hair and don the robes of a śramaṇa. From the pit shoot him, cut off his tusks and bring two back here.”
The archer did as he was ordered and travelled to the place the elephant took his ease. First, he shot the elephant, then wearing monastic garb and holding a begging bowl, he sat in the pit. The elephant king saw the śramaṇa and immediately lowered his head and said, “Greetings ascetic! Why do you want to steal my life away?”
He replied, “I want your tusks.”
The elephant said, “My pain is difficult to bear, quickly take my tusks and go! Do not disturb my mind and arouse evil thoughts. Thinking evil thoughts as one dies will mean entering Mount Tai, being reborn as a hungry ghost, or as an animal. Now, embodying patience and practicing kindness when evil is encountered and responding with goodness, this is the highest conduct of the Bodhisattva. One must not violate this standard of conduct right until the end even if one’s bones are on the chopping block or one’s flesh is being dried. If one behaves like this, on death one will ascend to the heavens, and will swiftly pass into extinction.”
The man immediately started to cut through his tusks. The elephant said, “Ascetic, be on your way! Don’t let my herd use your footprints to track you down.”
Only when the man had gone some distance, his pain difficult to bear, did the elephant fall to the ground bellowing loudly. All at once he was dead and was immediately reborn in the heavens. Groups of elephants arrived from all sides, each saying, “Who has killed our king?”
They searched, but could not find the killer. Returning, they kept watch over their king, wailing piteously.
The archer returned with the tusks, and when the King saw them, he felt sorrow and fear. His wife took the tusks in her hands and was inspecting them when a bolt of lightning hit her. She spat blood, dropped dead and descended into the earth-prisons.
The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “At that time the elephant king was me; my principal wife was Yaśodharā (Quiyi 求夷), the hunter was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達), and my secondary wife was Sundarī (Haoshou 好首) [3].
  The Bodhisattva’s resolute, limitless practice of obedience to the rules is like this.

He constantly upheld the teachings of the Buddha and had surrendered his life to the Three Honoured Ones. He knew one day he would face death and was determined not to commit one of the Ten Evils, and with a kind heart he taught and converted, treating the Six Perfections as paramount.
The ruler of the kingdom was fond of eating parrot so hunters competed to search them out. On one occasion, seeing this flock of parrots, they used a net to trap them and captured the entire flock and presented them to the Grand Provisioner [1]. The Assistant Minister of State accepted them and the fat ones were immediately poached and used to prepare delicacies. The King of the Parrots thought deeply to himself, “Living beings are confused. They go to the earth-prisons [2] on death, yet when they return to the Three Realms they cannot refrain from eating.”
He told his followers: “Eliminate greed and relinquish food. This will cause but negligible suffering, and you can hope to retain your life! The foolish are gluttonous and they do not take the long view; they are like a miser’s son greedy for a smidgen of honey on the edge of a knife oblivious to the danger of cutting off his tongue. I have now cut out food, you should model yourselves on me!”
The King of the Parrots grew daily thinner, which provided the opportunity for him to jump out through the bars of his cage. Standing on top of the cage he said, “Greed is the greatest evil; lack of desire the most admirable good.”
He continued, “The buddhas regard greed as a prison, a trap, a poison, or a blade; you should curtail your consumption of food then you can be like me!”
From then on, when the Bodhisattva was an ordinary person, he ate only coarse fare to keep him going, and had only tattered garments to cover his frame. Never a day passed when the prohibition against greed was not kept in mind. If his merit resulted in him being a ruler, he would always, in accordance with the Buddha’s wisdom, consider his kingdom a tie to the secular world and therefore an impediment. His good fortune was so lofty and far-reaching it was difficult to assess. Impermanence and lack of security cause only hardship and misery. Whatever there is will always disappear. The body is but a falsity, an illusion. It is as difficult to protect as an egg; as difficult to nurture as a wolf. Of those who have eyes to see, none do not shiver at the thought. The Bodhisattva, life after life, lived accordance with the Buddhist rules, and in due course perfected himself becoming a Thus-Come One, one bound by no ties, of supreme, perfect awakening, and the Teacher of Heavenly Beings and Men. 
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “At that time, King of the Parrots was me. The human king was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”
  The Bodhisattva’s resolute, limitless practice of obedience to the rules is like this.

Inwardly pure and outwardly unblemished, he constantly admonished himself, on guard against the scourge of wicked behaviour. He respected the Buddhist sages, was filial to his parents and his kindness assisted all living beings. When the Crown Prince had an audience with his sovereign he always deferred to the Chief Minister, his every action conforming with the correct protocol, never in breach of propriety. The King’s favourite concubine, who harboured wicked and licentious feelings for the Crown Prince, came out and took him by the hand. The Crown Prince struggled hard and managed to escape her clutches, but in doing so hit the Chief Minister’s head whilst crying, “Get off!”
His cap tumbled to the floor revealing he was bald. The palace women laughed at him and he became ashamed and resentful. The concubine went crying to the King, saying, “Although I am of but lowly status, I am still like a wife to Your Majesty, but the Crown Prince is acting immodestly and wants to take me as a concubine.”
The King said, “Whatever the Crown Prince does, if it does not meet Buddhist aims he will not countenance it, if it does not accord with the Buddha’s teachings he will not say it, and if does not conform with the Buddha’s Way he will not practice it. The entire world praises his virtue; throughout many kingdoms none can compare with him. How could he have done something improper?”
But these slanders, oft repeated, caused doubt to arise in the King’s mind and he said, “When those sharing the same flesh and blood harm one another, this is called ‘revolt’ – I will not do it.”
He appointed his son ruler of the border area a couple of thousand miles from the capital. He said, “Defend the area beyond our borders taking Heaven as your model in the practice of humaneness. Do not harm the lives of the people, and don’t let careless greed cause difficulties for the common folk. Respect the elderly as if they were your own parents and cherish the people as if they were your own children. Assiduously adhere to the Buddha’s rules and hold fast to the Buddha’s Way even unto death. There are many wicked deceivers in this world – only trust instructions which come with the imprint of my teeth on them.”
The Crown Prince prostrated himself his tears flowing, “I would not dare ignore your respected counsel.”
Then he left to supervise the territory. Using the Five Rules and the Ten Virtues he transformed the people of the kingdom through kindness. After he had been there a year, distant peoples from beyond the border thought so well of the benefits he had brought to his territory that they submitted to him, paying allegiance to him in their droves increasing the number of households in the area controlled by him by more than ten thousand. The Crown Prince reported these developments, praising the King’s virtuous beneficence which had brought about this situation from afar. The King and his wives and court women were delighted and heaped praise on the Crown Prince. But still that concubine harboured extraordinary hatred towards him. She was now having an affair with the Chief Minister and they plotted to get rid of the prince. She took her chance while the King slept and using wax made an imprint of his teeth and faked a letter saying, “You have committed a crime of unpardonable hubris. I cannot bear to see you punished in person, so on receipt of this letter pluck out your eyes and hand them over to the messenger who will return them to the kingdom.”
When the envoy arrived, all his officials said, “This is a rebel envoy! This is not from His Majesty.”
The Crown Prince said, “It bears the imprint of His Majesty’s front teeth, so I believe it comes from him. If I were to cherish my own body and go against the orders of my parent would be treason.”
With that he set off to enjoy himself for three days with his officials, travelling all over within the boundaries of his domain and, taking the Buddha as his model, donating to the destitute and bringing succour to the poor. With a kind heart he instructed the populace. They recruited someone able to extract his eyes, hiring a young livestock merchant who gouged his eyes out and handed them over to the envoy. He boxed them up and swiftly conveyed them back to their kingdom. The Chief Minister handed them over to the concubine who hung them over her bed and cursed him saying, “You wouldn’t go along with my desires, how are your gouged eyes enjoying what they see now?”
The great king dreamed a snake-bee stung the Crown Prince in his eyes and awoke choking with sobs. He said, “Has some calamity befallen my son?”
The concubine said, “Your Majesty thinks so much about him. This is why you had this dream, it is certainly not because the something bad has happened to him.”
The Crown Prince relied on playing the zither to find food to sustain him. He roamed around many kingdoms and arrived in that where his consort’s father was ruler. The ruler, hearing a wonderful zither player had arrived, summoned him so he could listen to him play.  His music began praising the virtue of former kings and ended [1] with music on the sorrow of an orphan with no family. His consort understood his music, sobbing as she said, “My Lord is destitute!”
The ruler asked, “What are you saying?”
The Prince’s wife explained everything, and as she was taking leave of her father the ruler said, “It is the fate of a wife; a woman must treat her birth-clan as secondary – to do otherwise is improper. I request to be permitted to accompany my husband, the most filial of men.”
Her parents were sorely grieved as she took her husband back to his original kingdom.
The Crown Prince’s father, the King, heard marvellous zither playing and called the musician to play for him. His appearance was so very haggard the King only recognised him by his voice, and cried, “You are my son, Fashi!”
The Crown Prince lay prostrate sobbing. The queen and the palace women, high-ranking and low, none were not deeply moved. His son’s wife explained what had happened from start to finish. The King said, “Alas! A woman who is not humane is like good rice mixed with poison. The Buddha instructed that we should keep them at a distance – how appropriate!”
He immediately had the Chief Minister and the concubine taken into custody and flogged with thorny switches. Flaming molten resin was then dropped on the wounds which caused them to split open when it dried, then he buried them alive in a pit.
The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “In a former life the Crown Prince sold white pearls, and that concubine was at that time the daughter of a wealthy family. She was travelling in a carriage, and the Chief Minister was her driver. She called out to the pearl seller, saying, ‘Come and show me your pearls.’
She grabbed the pearls but would not pay for them, and instead she talked to him while eyeing him lasciviously. The young man grew irate and said, ‘If you don’t give me back my pearls and keep looking at me like that, I will gouge your eyes out.’
The woman and the driver both said, ‘How would you like to be beaten with thorny switches, have resin dropped on the wounds, splitting your flesh, and then be buried alive?’
Now, once good and evil have been displayed, good and bad fortune will naturally follow like shadow tied to form. Wickedness comes to fruition and punishment will be meted as an echo responds to sound. Doing harm and hoping for no disastrous outcome is like sowing a seed then trying to stop it germinating. The Bodhisattva accepted the Buddha’s Pure Rules and would rather lose his eyes and die than offend the rule against living lustfully. At that time, the Crown Prince Fashi was me. The Chief Minister was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達) and the favourite concubine was Devadatta’s wife.”
  The Bodhisattva’s resolute, limitless practice of obedience to the rules is like this.

Walking around searching for food to save their insignificant lives there came a day, when passing through a mountainous area, their food stocks depleted, the Bodhisattva’s two brothers made the following suggestion: “We could save our lives using our wives for food!”
The elder brother killed his wife first and divided her into five pieces. The youngest brother was kind-hearted and compassionate and, grieving, did not partake. The middle brother also killed his wife and the youngest was so very upset he choked with sobs. His two brothers wanted to kill his wife next, and the youngest said, “To kill another to keep oneself intact is not the humane way of the Buddha – I will not do it!”
He took his wife into the mountains where he gathered fruit to sustain them and they passed a few years there. In the mountains there was a lame man with whom the wife had an affair, and they plotted to kill her husband. She deceitfully told her husband, “By rights it should be I who should do the work of looking after us both, yet it is you, my lord, who does it. Tomorrow I will come with you to help; I want to share all the hardship with you.”
He replied, “These mountain paths are extremely perilous and difficult to negotiate, you won’t be able to deal with them.”
Three times she made her demand and was refused before he let her accompany him. When the woman saw a suitably high mountain spot over a deep valley she shoved her husband and he fell down into the ravine. But at the waterside there was a divine being who took him to safety. The wife was delighted that she had achieved her aim, and returned to live with her lame man.
The husband found his way along the river and encountered some merchants to whom he related the whole story. They took pity on him and took him to a prospering kingdom. That kingdom’s monarch had died and he was without an heir, all the officials had declined the appointment and so there was no one to take the throne. They had ordered a brahmin to prognosticate on the matter and he predicted that among the sojourners travelling through the kingdom would be one whose features correspond with those of a monarch and that he should be enthroned as king. When this brahmin saw the Bodhisattva he promptly exclaimed, “Excellent! This is a noble in possession of the Way, he will protect the common people with heavenly kindness.”
The official class and the common people alike shed tears and praised his goodness, all wishing him a long life. He was respectfully conveyed into the palace, and the throne was bestowed upon him. With the Four Equal States of Mind [1] he nurtured the people and they relinquished all forms of evil arts. He conferred the Five Rules upon them and advocated they adopt the Ten Kinds of Good Behaviour. Within his territory all upheld the precepts and henceforward the King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), blessed and protected this kingdom, so demons and monsters swiftly dispersed, poisonous miasmas dissipated, and grains and fruits ripened in abundance. Neighbouring kingdoms were converted to the right, enemies and those who bore ill-will once again behaved as kinfolk, and droves arrived bundling their infants on their back wanting to live under this virtuous rule [2].
The woman entered the kingdom, cradling her lame husband, and while begging for alms, related the trouble she had taken to protect her husband from the chaos of the age. Now they had come to take refuge in the kindness of this ruler. The people of the kingdom, of all ranks, wondered at her tale. They all agreed, “The acts of a worthy wife should be recorded!”
The wife said, “That would be a generous reward.”
The King promptly invited the woman for an audience and asked, “Do you not recognise the Son of Heaven [3]?”
His wife bowed her head to the ground before him in fear. The King explained the story for his courtiers from start to finish, and the official charged with upholding the law cried, “She should be executed!”
The King said, “The buddhas regard humaneness as the greatest treasure of the Three Realms, I would rather die that depart from the humane way.”
The wife was driven out of the kingdom and made to sweep up her footprints as she left.
The Buddha told Śāriputra (Qiuliuzi 鶖鷺子), “The King was me, the lame man was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達 ), the wife was Sundarī (Haoshou 好首).""
  The Bodhisattva’s resolute, limitless practice of obedience to the rules is like this.
  Notes:
[1] The Four Equalities (si deng 四等) or Four Equal States of Mind (si deng xin 四等心) are the apramānas, four states of mind a Buddha manifests to all, later translated as the Four Immeasurable States of Mind (si wuliang xin 四無量心). They are loving-kindness (maitrī; ci 慈), compassion (karuṇā; bei 悲), sympathetic joy (muditā; xi 喜), and equanimity (upekṣā; she 捨).
[2] This is probably an allusion to the Lunyu 14.4:上好禮，則民莫敢不敬；上好義，則民莫敢不服；上好信，則民莫敢不用情。夫如是，則四方之民襁負其子而至矣. When a ruler loves rightness, then none among his people will dare not to obey. When a ruler loves trustworthiness, then none of his people will dare not be honest. The mere existence of such a ruler would cause the common people throughout the world to bundle their children on their backs 襁負 and seek him out. Slingerland trans. 2003, 140. Both 14.4 and LDJJ 31 use the phrase qiangfu 襁負 (describing tying a child to the back with a strip of cloth). I have added ‘wanting to live under this virtuous rule’ (which does not appear in the Chinese) to bring out this allusion.
[3] ‘Son of Heaven’, tianzi 天子, is a common epithet for a Chinese ruler."

He understood everything there was to know about all manner of medical skills and the cries of birds and beasts. Realising the age was one of disorder and corruption, he hid away and did not take office [2]. He upheld the Buddha’s Rules and followed only the True. Poverty-stricken he hired himself out as a bearer for a merchant and having crossed a river, they were eating by the bank, when a great flock of crows started clamouring. The merchant was so fearful his thick hair stood on end, but the Bodhisattva just laughed at them. When they had finished eating and were about to set off and return home, the man who had hired him said, “The birds’ cries made you laugh, why?”
He replied, “The crows said, ‘That man has some white pearls of great value. Kill him and you take the pearls, then we can then eat his flesh.’ That’s why I laughed at them, that’s all.”
The merchant said, “Then why didn’t you kill me?”
He replied, “Now, one who does not observe the Buddha’s scriptures and perpetrates a heinous evil thinking there will be no misfortune arising from his actions deludes himself. I have understood the writings of unsurpassed Truth and I observe the purity and humaneness of the Bodhisattva. One should cherish things that creep and fly, scuttle and crawl – not kill them. And one should not take even a single blade of grass that does not belong to you. Now those fond of killing are not humane, and those fond of stealing are not pure. By reason of my defilements accrued because I was fond of taking in previous lives, I now reap the disastrous rewards of destitution and poverty such that I must hire myself out to you. To offend further would be a crime of unquantifiable magnitude and is not something a disciple of the Buddha would do. I would rather uphold the Buddha’s Way and die in poverty than live an immoral life with wealth and status.”
The consignor said, “That is wonderful! Only the Buddha’s teachings are true.”

Compassionately, he made a vow: “May there be none among the beings of the Ten Directions who fear such as I do today; I vow to achieve Buddhahood in the future and save such creatures.”
Come the seventh day, the boat had still not moved and a sea god improperly gave the consignor a dream, in which he said, “Get rid of the pauper and I will allow you to leave.”
The consignor sorrowfully lamented this dream. He discussed the matter secretly with the other merchants, but the poor man looked on and understood entirely what was happening. He said, “Don’t endanger the lives of the group for me, just one man.”
The consignor made a raft and gave him some dried provisions. He lowered the poor man onto the raft and pushed him off into the distance. An enormous fish overturned the boat and ultimately ate the merchants. The poor man was blown along by the wind till he reached the shore. When he reached his home all his relations were delighted.

But when the ruler saw the elder brother, whose looks were imposing, whose words were always in accordance with the sagely scriptures, whose elegance was hard to match, he changed his mind and offered his daughter to the elder brother instead. His daughter was overwhelmed with happiness, but the elder brother thought to himself, “A husband’s older brother is like a father; a younger brother’s wife is like a child. This would be a father, child relationship, how could this be regarded as a proper marriage? This ruler may be a respected lord of men, but his behaviour is that of a beast.”
He promptly led his brother away. The woman climbed a tower and, as they went into the distance, cried after them, “I vow to become a demon and eat your elder brother’s liver!”
Having passed through many lives and deaths the elder brother became a monkey. The younger and the woman both became turtles. The turtle-wife was sick and craved a monkey’s liver, and her mate set out to look for one. He saw a monkey who had come down to drink. The turtle said to him, “Have you ever had the chance to listen to music?”
He replied, “Never!”
The turtle said, “At mine there is some wonderful music being played, would you like to come and see?”
The monkey said, “I would.”
The turtle said, “Climb on my back, and I will take you to observe.”
The monkey climbed on and went off with him. Halfway across the river the turtle said, “My wife wants to eat your liver! How could you ever imagine there would be music under the water?”
The monkey felt somewhat shamefaced and thought to himself, “Now, holding fast to the Rules is the key to good behaviour, but on balance, when in dire straits, it best to save yourself.” [1]
He said, “Then why didn’t you say so earlier? I hung my liver on that tree over there.”
The turtle took him at his word and turned back. When the monkey was on the bank he said, “Die turtle demon! How on earth could my liver, an internal organ, be hanging on a tree?”
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
  “The elder brother was me. I constantly upheld the rules on purity, and never offended the rules against illicit sexual relations. I sunk into rebirth as a monkey to bring to an end some residual bad fortune, the result of some bad behaviour in a past life. The younger brother and the woman both received birth as a turtle. The male was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達), and the female was Devadatta’s wife.
  The Bodhisattva’s resolute, limitless practice of obedience to the rules is like this.
  Notes:
[1] In other words, telling a lie (and breaching the Rules) is an acceptable expedient in order to save yourself in a situation such as this."
《六度集經》卷4：「（三七）「昔者菩薩，乘船[17]渡海，採寶濟乏。海邊有城，苑園備有，華女臨渚要其輩曰：『斯國豐沃，珍寶恣求，可屈入城，觀民有無。』商人信從鬼魅厭惑，遂留與居，積年有五。菩薩感思二親本土，出城登山四顧遠望，覩一鐵城中有丈夫，首戴天冠儼然恭坐，謂菩薩曰：『爾等惑乎？以[18]鬼魅為妻，捐爾二親九族之厚，為鬼所吞豈不惑哉？爾等無寐，察其真[19]贋矣。方有神馬翔茲濟眾，可附旋居全爾身命。若戀蠱[20]妻。死入斯城，眾毒普加，悔將無救。』菩薩承命，訛寐察之，覩真如云，厥心懼焉。明日密相告，等人僉然，各伺覩妻變為狐體，競爭食人。靡不憮然，曰：『吾等死矣。』相驚備豫懈即喪矣。馬王臻曰：『孰有離居心懷所親，疾來赴茲，吾將濟爾。』商人喜曰：『斯必天也。』群馳歸命。妻即抱子尋跡哀慟，其辭曰：『怨呼皇天，為妻累載，今以為鬼。』哀聲傷情。辭詣王所，厥云如上，『今者[1]偟偟，無由自[2]恃，惟願大王哀理妾情。』王召菩薩問其所由，即以所覩本末陳之。王覩色美疾遣婿去，內之後宮為其淫荒，國[3]正紛亂。鬼化為狐，日行食人，為害[4]茲甚，王不覺矣。「後各命終，生死輪轉，菩薩積德，遂得為佛。狐鬼魂靈，化生梵志家，有絕妙之色。佛時於作法縣求食，食畢出城坐樹下。梵志覩佛相好，容色紫金，項有日光，若星中月。覩佛若此，其喜無量，歸白兒母：『吾女獲婿，其為世雄。疾以名服、具世諸好。』梵志家室携女貢之，道覩足跡。妻曰：『斯無欲之神雄，豈以[5]淫邪亂其志乎？』父曰：『吾女國之上華，胡高德而不迴耶？』妻即頌其義曰：「『婬者曳足行，  多恚斂指步， 愚者足築地，  斯跡天人尊。 「『無自辱也。』父曰：『爾薄智也。』戾而行矣，以女獻焉。世尊告曰：『第六魔天，獻吾三女，變為[6]𥥧鬼。今爾屎囊，又來何為？』梵志恧然，妻重恥之。時，有除饉，進稽首曰：『願以惠余。』世尊戒曰：『爾昔為王，女時為鬼，以色誑爾，吞盡爾民，爾不厭乎？』除饉恥焉，退禪獲定，得溝港道。」佛告鶖鷺子：「菩薩自受城中人戒已，旋家，歸命三尊自誓辭云：『時當死，死不復犯如來、應儀、正真覺清淨重戒。』積戒弘多，佛道遂成。爾時[7]長者，吾身是也。王者，今比丘是。鬼者，梵志女是。城中天人者，鶖鷺子是。菩薩執志度無極行持戒如是。」」[17] 渡【大】，度【宋】【元】【明】　[18] 鬼【大】，魑【宋】【元】【明】　[19] 贋【大】，諺【宋】【元】【明】　[20] 妻【大】，毒【宋】【元】【明】　[1] 偟偟【大】，惶惶【宋】【元】【明】　[2] 恃【大】，持【明】　[3] 正【大】，政【元】【明】　[4] 茲【大】，滋【元】【明】　[5] 淫【大】，婬【宋】【元】【明】　[6] 𥥧【大】，老【元】【明】　[7] 長【大】，女【元】【明】,"In former times the Bodhisattva was crossing the sea in a boat seeking to gather precious items to save him from poverty. By the shore there was a city, with parks and gardens. Beautiful women approached the waterside and invited him and his fellows ashore saying, “This kingdom is rich and prosperous, you can seek treasures as you please. Might we invite you to enter our city and see what the people have and what they lack?”
The merchants trustingly followed these demons, bewitched. They stayed and set up home with them. Five years passed. The Bodhisattva missed his parents and his native land. He ascended a mountain outside the city and looked around far into the distance. He saw a man in a city surrounded by an iron wall wearing a heavenly diadem as he sat solemnly and in reverence. He said to the Bodhisattva, “You have been bewitched! You have taken demons as your wives and cast aside your feelings for your parents and relatives. You have been swallowed up by these demons – is that not being bewitched? Stay awake! Then you will see what is true and what is false! There is a divine horse here that circles overhead and saves people. He can carry you back home and save your life. But if you were to think fondly of your venomous wife, you will die and enter this city. The myriad poisons are widespread and while you will feel remorse, nothing will be able to save you.”
The Bodhisattva did as he was instructed and feigned sleep to observe his wife.What he saw was just as had been described, and he was terrified. The next day he secretly told the others and they all followed his example. Each kept a close watch on his wife and saw them change into foxes and compete to devour men. They were all petrified, and exclaimed, “We are doomed!”
They kept one another alert and prepared, as any negligence would result in their death. The horse king arrived and said, “Whosoever has been separated from his home and has cherished memories of his loved ones, come quickly! I will save you.”
As they rushed to entrust their lives to him the merchants cried happily, “This is certainly a god!”
Cradling his child, the wife of the Bodhisattva came looking for him very upset, saying, “I petition you, oh illustrious god! I have been this man’s wife for many years, and now he accuses me of being a demon!”
The piteous sounds she made were very moving.
She took her leave and went before the ruler of the Bodhisattva’s land and repeated her laments. “Now I am frightened. I have no one to rely on, and I only hope Your August Majesty will sympathise and do something about your servant’s situation.”
The ruler summoned the Bodhisattva and asked what his reasons were for behaving like this. He promptly explained to the ruler what he had seen from start to finish. The ruler observed this beauty, swiftly sent her husband away, and had her installed in his harem where he was able to indulge his licentiousness. The realm’s governance fell into chaos. The demon changed into a fox and feasted on men daily. The harm done was extreme, yet the ruler did not notice.
Later each reached the end of their lives and the wheel of birth and death turned. The Bodhisattva accumulated merit and became a Buddha, and the fox demon’s soul was born into the family of a brahmin as a woman of exquisite beauty. At that time the Buddha was looking for food in an area the Law was practiced. Once he had finished eating, he went out of the city and sat beneath a tree. The brahmin observed the fine appearance of the Buddha, his countenance was the colour of fine gold, the nape of his neck girdled with the light of the sun, like the moon among the stars. Having seen the Buddha like this, his happiness knew no bounds and he returned to tell his wife saying, “Our daughter has a husband! He is a World Hero! Quick get some fine clothing and the best things the world can offer.”
The brahmin and his wife took their daughter to offer her to the Buddha in marriage, and on the way, they observed the Buddha’s footprints. The wife said, “This man is a divine hero devoid of desire, how can we disturb his resolve by arousing lust?”
The father said, “Our daughter is the kingdom’s most beautiful flower, how could the highest virtue not be turned by her?”
His wife then put her meaning into verse:
  “The licentious drag their feet,
The furious clench their toes,
The ignorant stamp the ground.
These footprints are surely those,
Of one by gods and men renowned.’
Don’t dishonour yourself!”
The father retorted, “What do you know?”
Ignoring her he went ahead and presented his daughter to the Buddha.
The World Honoured One told him, “The Māra-demon of the Sixth Heaven offered me his three daughters and I changed them into aged ghosts. Now, why have you too brought me a bag of excrement?”
The brahmin was ashamed and his wife very humiliated. At that time there was a monk who entered and respectfully prostrated himself and said, “I request that you give her to me.”
The World Honoured One admonished him saying, “In the past you were a ruler and at that time this woman was a demon. She bewitched you with her beauty, and devoured all your people. Are you not revolted by this?”
The monk was ashamed and returned to meditation where he concentrated and attained stream entry.
  The Buddha told Śāriputra (Qiuliuzi 鶖鷺子), “When the Bodhisattva received the warning from the man within the city, he immediately returned home and took refuge in the Three Honoured Ones and vowed to himself, saying, ‘When the time comes that I should die, even in death I will never violate the pure and weighty Rules of the Thus-come One, the One Deserving of Respect, the One Awakened to the True.’ Having accumulated merit from adherence to the Rules, he perfected the Buddha’s Way. At that time the householder was me. The ruler was this bhikṣu. The demon was the brahmin’s wife and the divine man in the city was you, Śāriputra.”
  The Bodhisattva’s resolute, limitless practice of obedience to the rules is like this."
《六度集經》卷4：「（三八）太子[8]墓魄經聞如是：一時佛在聞物國祇樹給孤獨園。是時佛告諸沙門：「往昔有國名波羅奈，王有太子，名曰[＊]墓魄，生有無窮之明，過去現在未來眾事，其智無[9]礙，端正暉光，猶星中月。王[＊]唯有一子，國無不愛，而年十三，閉口不言，有若瘖人。王后憂焉，呼諸梵志，問其所由。對曰：『斯為不祥也，端正不言，何益大王？後宮無嗣，豈非彼害哉？法宜生埋之，必有貴嗣。』王即恧然，入與后議，后逮宮人靡不哀慟，嗟曰：『奈何太子祿薄，生獲斯殃。』哀者塞路，猶有大喪。具著寶服，以付喪夫。喪夫奪其名服，[10]覩共為[11]塚。[＊]墓魄惟曰：『王[12]逮國人，信吾真瘖。』即默斂衣入水淨浴，以香塗身，具著寶服，臨壙呼曰：『爾等胡為？』答曰：『太子瘖聾為國[13]無嗣，王命生埋，冀生賢嗣。』曰：『吾即[＊]墓魄矣。』喪夫視車霍然空虛，觀其形容，曜曜有光，草野遐邇猶日之明，聖靈巨勢，神動靈祇。喪夫巨細靡不懾驚，兩兩相視，顏貌黃青，言成文章靡不畏焉？仰天而曰：『太子靈德乃之于[14]斯！』即叩頭陳曰：『願旋寧王，令眾不嗟。』太子曰：『爾疾啟王，云吾能言。』人即馳聞，王后兆民甚怪所以，心[15]懽稱善，靡不悅豫，車馳人[16]犇，殷填塞路。[＊]墓魄曰：『吾獲為沙門虛[17]靖之行，不亦善乎？』意始如之。「帝釋即化為苑池樹木，非世所覩，即去眾寶衣化為袈裟。王到已，太子五體投地，稽首如禮，王即就坐聞其言聲，光影威靈，二儀為動，王喜喻曰：『吾有爾來，舉國敬愛，當嗣天位，為民父母。』對曰：『惟願大王！哀採微言。吾昔甞為斯國王，名曰須念，處國臨民二十五年，身奉十善育民以慈，鞭杖眾兵都息不行，囹圄無繫囚，路無怨嗟聲，惠施流布，潤無不周。但以出遊翼從甚眾，導臣馳除，黎庶惶懼；終入太山燒煮割裂，積六萬年，求死不得，呼嗟無救。當爾之時，內有九親，表有臣民，[18]資財億載，眾樂無極，寧知吾入太山地獄燒煮眾痛無極之苦乎？生存之榮，妻子臣民，孰能分取諸苦去乎？惟彼諸毒其為無量，每壹憶之心怛骨楚，身為虛汗，毛為寒竪。言往禍來，[A3]殃追影[19]尋，雖欲發言懼復獲咎，太山之苦難可再更，是以縮舌都欲無言。始十三年，而妖導師令王生埋吾。懼大王獲太山之咎，勢復一言耳。今欲為沙門守無欲之行，覩眾禍之門不復為王矣。願無怪焉。』王曰：『爾為令君，行高德尊，率民以道，過猶絲髮，非人所憶，以之獲罪，酷裂乃如之耶！如吾今為人主，從心所欲，不奉正法，終當何之乎？』即聽學道。王還治國以正不邪，遂致豐樂。[＊]墓魄即自練情絕欲，志進道真遂至得佛，廣說[20]景模，拯濟眾生以至滅度。」佛告諸比丘：「時[＊]墓魄者，吾身是也。父王者，今白淨王是也。母者，吾母今舍妙是也。夫榮色邪樂者，燒身之鑪矣。清淨[1]澹泊，無患之家矣。若欲免難離罪者，無失佛教也。為道雖苦，猶勝處[2]夫三塗，為人即遠貧窶，不處八難矣。學道之志當如佛行也，欲獲緣一覺、應真、滅度者，取之可得。」佛說經竟，諸沙門莫不歡喜，稽首作禮。」[8] 墓【大】＊，慕【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[＊8-1] 墓【大】＊，慕【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[9] 礙【大】，疑【宋】【元】【明】　[10] 覩【大】，都【宋】【元】【明】　[11] 塚【大】，[冗-几+(一/豖)]【宋】【元】【明】　[＊8-2] 墓【大】＊，慕【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[12] 逮【大】，道【宋】　[13] 無嗣【大】，之害【宋】【元】【明】　[＊8-3] 墓【大】＊，慕【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[14] 斯【大】，斯乎【元】【明】　[15] 懽【大】，歡【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 犇【大】，奔【宋】【元】【明】　[＊8-4] 墓【大】＊，慕【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[17] 靖【大】，靜【宋】【元】【明】　[18] 資【大】，貲【宋】【元】【明】　[A3] 殃【CB】【麗-CB】，殀【大】(cf.

Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Wenwuguo 聞物國), at his monastery in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu 祇樹) among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada. At that time the Buddha told the śramaṇas:
 In the past there was a kingdom called Vārāṇasī (Boluonai 波羅㮈). The ruler had an heir, a Crown Prince called Mupo (墓魄, 'Grave Soul'). Born with boundless perspicacity, his knowledge extended unobstructed to everything about the past, present and future. Handsome and brilliant, he was like the moon among the stars. The ruler had only one son, and there were none in the kingdom who did not dote on the child, yet by the age of thirteen he had not spoken; he was like a dumb mute. The ruler and his consort were worried about him and summoned the brahmins to ask their opinion on the cause. They replied, “This is inauspicious. Being handsome is all very well, but if he cannot speak what use is he, Great Majesty? None of the other palace women have produced issue; is it not the child which harms you? Precedent suggests it is fitting that you should bury him alive, then you will certainly produce noble descendants.”
The ruler felt ashamed and went to discuss this with his consort. The queen and the palace women were all deeply grieved and sighed, saying, “How could the Crown Prince have such scant good fortune, to be born and have this calamity befall him?”
The sorrowful thronged the roads as if there was a great funeral. Dressed in fine clothes the Prince was handed over to the undertakers who took his fine clothing and all began to dig the grave [1]. Mupo thought to himself, “The ruler and the subjects of the kingdom believe I am truly dumb.”
He silently prepared his funeral clothing, entered the water to cleanse himself and perfumed his body, then wearing his fine clothing he stood at the edge of the grave-pit and cried out, “What are you doing?”
They replied, “The Crown Prince is deaf mute and leaves the kingdom without a suitable heir so the King has ordered us to bury the Prince alive in the hope that he will produce a worthy successor.”
He announced, “I am Mupo!”
The undertakers saw the carriage was all of a sudden empty, and observed the Prince’s radiance shining bright; it was as if the countryside was illuminated by the sun far and wide as his strong spiritual power and divine spirit moved the gods of heaven and earth. The undertakers, old and young, were all terrified, and looked at one another, their faces quite green with fear. The Prince's speech had a literary elegance and rendered them all terrified. They raised their heads to the Heavens and cried, “Such is the numinous power of the Crown Prince!”
They immediately prostrated themselves touching their heads to the ground and announced, “Let us return and call on the King to put a stop to all the lamenting.”
The Crown Prince said, “Quickly go and inform the King that I am able to speak.”
Someone sped off to inform him. The King, the Queen, and all their subjects were utterly astonished. Joyous, they proclaimed this wonderful news and all rejoiced. Carts and men rushed in throngs blocking the roads. Mupo said to himself, “Would it not be even better if I became a śramaṇa, and lived a self-effacing, tranquil life?”
No sooner had he conceived this notion than Śakra, King of the Gods (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), transformed the area into a park with pools and trees such as are not of this world, removed the precious garments and transformed them into kaṣāya robes.
When the ruler arrived the Crown Prince prostrated himself before him, knocking his head to the ground as ceremony demanded. The ruler took his seat and listened to the sound of his voice, his radiance so powerful Heaven and Earth were moved. The ruler was delighted and issued the following statement, “Since we had you, the entire kingdom has respected and loved you. You will be my successor to the Heavenly Throne and serve as the father and mother of the people.”
He replied, “I only have one desire, Great Majesty, and that is that you sympathise with what I now humbly relate: in former times I was once the ruler of this kingdom. My name was Xunian (須念). I lived here and governed for twenty-five years. I upheld the Ten Kinds of Good Behaviour and I tended my people with compassion. Punishment with the lash or cane, or weaponry of any kind, ceased. Prisons had no prisoners. The roads were devoid of the sound of bitter laments. My giving was widespread, none not nourished by its reach. However, when I journeyed around my domain I was flanked by great numbers and those servants of mine in the lead hurriedly moved people out of my way and frightened them in the process. As a result, I ended up in Mount Tai, being roasted and sliced, and remained there for sixty-thousand years, yearning for a death that would not come, crying out in distress without succour. At that time, all my relations and all my ministers and people, enjoyed wealth in the millions of cartloads and limitless joys. How could they know I had entered the earth-prisons of Mount Tai and was being roasted, suffering all kinds of pain, my hardship being without end? With all the glories of life, could any among my wife, children, ministers and people take away a portion of this suffering from me? It was only I who had to endure those uncountable poisons. Each and every time I think about it, the suffering penetrates my bones; although bathed in sweat, I become so cold my hairs stand on end. What one has said in the past has consequences in the future! Misfortune will pursue one as shadow does ones’ form. Although I wanted to speak, I was fearful of the punishment which could follow. I found it difficult to contemplate suffering the tortures of Mount Tai once more – this is why I kept my tongue tied not wanting to say anything, ever. Then when I was 13 years old, some monstrous advisor suggested Your Great Majesty bury me alive. I feared Your Majesty would reap the punishments of Mount Tai were he to do this, so I was forced to speak. Now I want to become a śramaṇa and conduct myself without desire, which I regard as the gateway to all troubles. I never again want to be a ruler. I hope you do not think this strange.”
The ruler said, “As a ruler your conduct was highly regarded and your virtue respected, you led your people in accordance with the Way. You transgressed by a hair’s breadth. It is not something the people even remembered, yet because of it you received such brutal punishment! What ultimately awaits one such as he who has followed his heart’s desire and failed to uphold the True Law?”
Immediately he acceded to his son’s request that he study the Way. The ruler returned to governing the kingdom, he set himself straight by means of the Right and this resulted in prosperity and happiness. Mupo swiftly learned to keep his emotions in check and put a stop to his desires. He resolved to enter the Way of Truth and he achieved Buddhahood. He preached widely this great model and assisted sentient beings to pass over to extinction [2].
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “At that time, Mupo was me. The father was King Śuddhodana (Baijing wang 白淨王); the mother was my mother Māyā (Shemiao 舍妙). Now, glorifying beauty and taking enjoyment in the depraved are the furnace in which the body is roasted. Purity and tranquillity make for a worry-free home. If you desire to escape from difficulties and distance yourself from fault, do not neglect the Buddha’s teachings. Although there are hardships along the Way, it is better than being on one of the Three Unfortunate Roads [3]; it is better to be a person, not in poverty nor burdened by the Eight Difficulties. If you resolve to study the Way behave like a Buddha and wish to Awaken to Causation Alone (pratyeka-buddha), become a Worthy True One (arhat) or One Who Has Passed Over to Extinction, you can obtain just that.”
 When the Buddha finished expounding this scripture all the śramaṇas were delighted and bowed their heads to the ground in obeisance.

"《六度集經》卷4：「（三九）彌蘭經聞如是：一時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時，諸沙門閑居深惟：「世人習邪樂欲，自始至終無厭五樂[3]者。何謂五樂？眼色、耳聲、鼻香、口味、身細滑。夫斯五欲，至其命終，豈有厭者乎？」日中之後，俱詣佛所，稽首佛足退立白言：「吾等，世尊！惟世愚者惑于五欲，至厥命終，豈有厭者不？」佛告之曰：「覩世無足於彼五樂矣。昔有五百商人入海採利，中有智者名曰彌蘭，為眾師御。海有神魚，其名摩竭，觸敗其船，眾皆喪身，彌蘭騎板，僅而獲免。風漂附岸，地名鼻摩，登岸周[4]旋庶自[5]蘇息，覩一小徑尋之而進。遙見銀城，樹木茂盛，間有浴池，周旋四表，甘水[6]遶之。有四美人，容齊天女，奉迎之曰：『經涉巨海，厥勞多矣，善賀吉臻。今斯銀城，其中眾寶，黃金白銀，水精琉璃，珊瑚虎珀，車𤦲為殿，妾等四女給仁使役，晚息夙興，惟命所之，願無他遊。』彌蘭入城昇七寶殿，[7]懽娛從欲，願無不有，處中千餘年。彌蘭惟曰：『斯諸玉女不令吾邁，其有緣乎？』伺四女寢，竊疾亡去。「遙覩金城，有八玉女，迎辭如上，玉女華容，又踰四人。城中寶殿，名曰屑末，明月真珠諸寶踰前，壽數千萬歲。又疑：『八女不令吾邁，其有由乎？』伺其臥出，竊疾亡去。「又覩水精城，有十六玉女出迎之矣，其辭如上，要將入城昇七寶殿。城殿眾寶，玉女光華踰前，居中歲數，又數千萬。「意不厭足，又伺諸女臥出亡去，復覩琉璃寶城，光曜奕奕，有三十二女出迎跪拜，虔辭如上。要請入城昇七寶殿，殿名欝單，其中眾寶伎樂甘食女色踰前，處中久長年數如上。「又伺諸女臥出亡去，遙覩鐵城，莫無迎者。彌蘭惟曰：『銀城四女，金城有八，水精十六，琉璃三十二，玉女光世，修虔相迎，今不迎者，將以貴故乎？』周城一匝有鬼開門，彌蘭入城即見其鬼，鬼名俱引，鐵輪烔然走其頭上，守罪人鬼，取彼頭輪，著彌蘭頭上，腦流身燋。彌蘭流淚曰：『自四之八，自八之十六，自十六之三十二，處榮屑末殿、欝單殿。吾以無足之行，故獲斯矣。何當離斯患乎？』守鬼答曰：『其年之數如子來久，子免斯殃矣。』火輪處彌蘭頭上六億歲，乃免之矣。」佛語諸沙門：「彌蘭者，吾身是也。所以然者？未奉三尊時，愚惑信邪，母沐浴著新衣臥，吾蹈母首，故太山以火輪[8]轢其首耳。又[9]甞以四月八日，持八關齋，中心歡喜，故獲寶城，壽命巨億，所願從心無求不獲。覩世無足，[＊]唯得道乃止耳。」佛告諸沙門：「彌蘭出太山獄，閇心三惡，絕口四[A4]刃，檢身三尤。孝順父母，親奉三尊，戴戒為冠，服戒為衣，懷戒為糧，味戒為肴，食息坐行，不忘佛戒，[10]躇步之間，以戒德成，自致為佛。凡人之行，不孝於親，不尊奉師，吾覩其後自招重罪，彌蘭其類乎！夫為惡禍追，猶影尋身，絕邪崇真，眾禍自滅矣。」佛說經竟，諸沙門歡喜作禮。」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, p. 21a9-c7)[3] 者【大】，者也【元】【明】　[4] 旋【大】，遊【宋】【元】【明】　[5] 蘇【大】，穌【宋】【元】【明】　[6] 遶【大】，繞【宋】【元】【明】　[7] 懽【大】，歡【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 轢【大】，爍【宋】　[9] 甞【大】，常【宋】【元】【明】　[A4] 刃【CB】【麗-CB】【磧-CB】，刀【大】(cf.

Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國), at his monastery in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu 祇樹) among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada. At that time all the śramaṇas were living quietly thinking deeply on the fact that the people of the world had given themselves over to evil ways and took delight in pursuing their desires. Throughout their lives they can never get enough of the Five Pleasures. What are these Five Pleasures? They are the eye’s in form, the ear’s in sound, the nose’s in fragrance, the mouth’s in flavour and the body’s in the fine and smooth. Now, these Five Desires last till the end of one’s life. “Can they be satiated?”, they wondered.
 After mid-day they went to visit the Buddha, and after touching their heads to the Buddha’s feet, they stepped back, stood up, and said, “We, World Honoured One, wish to ask something: the foolish are confused by the Five Desires all their lives. Can one achieve satiety or not?”
The Buddha told them, “I have observed that those in this world never satiate these Five Pleasures. In the past, five hundred merchants put to sea in search of profit. Among them was a clever man by the name of Milan (彌蘭) who took charge. In the sea there was a divine fish, called a makara, that collided with the boat and destroyed it. All perished save Milan who rode atop a plank and avoided the fate of his shipmates. The wind blew him near to the shore of a place called Bimo (鼻摩). He went ashore and wandered around in the hope of reviving himself. He saw a small path and advanced along it. In the distance he saw a silver city. Luxuriant trees were interspersed with pools, and sweet waters flowed surrounding the city on all sides. Four beauties, in countenance like heavenly maidens, respectfully welcomed him saying, “Passing over the vast oceans the travails are many. Hearty congratulations on your auspicious arrival. Now, within this silver city are numerous treasures: the palaces are made from gold and silver, crystal, beryl, coral, amber and conch. We four women will serve you with kindness, retiring late and rising early to do so. We will comply with your every order as we do not want you to go elsewhere.”
Milan entered the city and ascended to the palace made of the seven treasures. Happily, he followed his heart’s desires and wanted for nothing. He lived there for more than one thousand years. Milan thought to himself, “These beautiful women do not allow me to travel. I wonder why?”
He waited till the four women were asleep and stole swiftly away. From afar he saw a golden city, and eight beautiful women welcomed him in the manner the four had done previously. These women were magnificent in appearance exceeding even that of the previous four. Within the city there was a palace called Xiemo Palace (屑末殿). Its bright-moon pearls [1] outshone all previous treasures. The lifespan there was several thousand years. He once again began to have his suspicions, “These eight women won’t allow me to travel, I wonder what’s the reason?”
He waited until they had gone to bed and stole swiftly away. Once again, he looked and saw a crystal city, from whence sixteen beautiful maidens emerged to welcome him as the other women had done previously, eager to take him into their city and up to a palace made of the Seven Treasures. The city’s palace was adorned with multiple jewels and the splendour of these maidens surpassed those he had encountered previously. He lived there for several million years. But his appetites were not satiated, and once again he waited until the women had gone off to bed and stole away. Once again, he saw a beryl city, radiating great brilliance. Thirty-two women came to greet him and knelt before him uttering the sincere words the other women had earlier. They were eager to invite him into their city and take him up to a palace made of the Seven Treasures called Yudan Palace (欝單殿). Within there were many jewels, music and fine foods. The women’s beauty surpassed that of the previous women. He lived there for a very long time as in the previous cities. Once again, he waited until the women had gone to bed before stealing away. In the distance he saw an iron city. No one was there to welcome him and Milan thought to himself, “In the silver city there were four women, in the gold city, eight, in the crystal city, sixteen and in the beryl city, thirty-two; all of these women lit up the world and greeted me in turn with cultivation and sincerity. Now no one comes to meet me. Perhaps the reason is they are too high born?”
In the wall surrounding the city a gate was opened by a demon, and Milan entered then saw that the demon, whose name was Juyin (俱引, ‘Entice All’), and who had a burning iron wheel rotating on his head. Another demon, who stood guard over miscreants, took the head-wheel and placed it on Milan’s head. His brains flowing and his body aflame, with tears falling he cried, “From four to eight, eight to sixteen, sixteen to thirty-two, I lived in the splendour of the Xiemo and Yudan Palaces. Because of my insatiable behaviour, it has come to this! How can I rid myself of this calamity?”
The guard-demon answered, “The number of years you will carry the burning wheel will be just as long as it takes for one such as yourself to arrive! Only then will you be relieved of this catastrophe.”
The burning wheel stayed on Milan’s head for six hundred thousand years and only then was he relieved of it.
  The Buddha said to the śramaṇas: “Milan was me. How did this come about? Before I had begun to serve the Three Honoured Ones, I was stupid and confused and I trusted in the wicked. My mother had bathed, put on new garments and lain down when I trod on her head. That is why in Mount Tai my head was ground down by a burning wheel. However, once on the eighth day of the fourth month I upheld the Eight Rules and experienced great happiness, and for that reason I received such very long lives in the bejewelled cities; whatever I desired I followed my heart, and whatever I sought there was nothing I did not obtain. I realised that worldly things would never satisfy me and only taking the Buddhist Path would put an end to desire.”
The Buddha told the śramaṇas: “When Milan emerged from the prison of Mount Tai, he closed his mind to the Three Evils, he broke off the mouth’s Four Blades, and examined himself for the Three Faults [2]. He showed filial obedience to his mother and father and entrusted himself to the Three Honoured Ones. He wore the Rules as his crown and his garments, and embraced them as his provisions, savouring them like a delicacy; eating, resting, sitting, and walking he never forgot the Buddha’s Rules even for the time it took to take a step. The power of the Rules brought him to perfection and by his own exertions became a Buddha.  I have seen what serious punishments ordinary men bring upon themselves when their actions are not filial to their parents and they do not respect and entrust themselves to a teacher. They are like Milan! Now, bad fortune pursues evil just like the shadow follows form. Put an end to the wicked and revere the True, then all misfortunes will be naturally extinguished!”
The Buddha finished explicating the teachings and the śramaṇas were full of joy and made obeisance.
  Notes:
[1] It is not entirely clear what a “bright-moon” or  “full-moon pearl” 明月珠 is: Yu notes (2013 [105], 70 and notes 39 and 40) it is “jewellery that shines. According to some, it is a kind of diamond; to others, it refers to the eye of the whale.”
[2] The Three Evils (san’e 三惡), the mouth’s Four Blades (siren 四刃), and the Three Faults (sanyou 三尤) together are an unusual formulation of the ten unwholesome activities or ‘Ten Evils’ (daśa-akuśala-karma-patha)."

Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國), at his monastery in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu 祇樹) among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada. At that time Ānanda (A’nan 阿難) was living quietly and thinking deeply on the fact that few living beings are repulsed by the Five Desires throughout their lives.
After mid-day he went to the Buddha, made obeisance by touching his head to the ground, and standing back once he had finished, said to the Buddha, “Oh World Honoured One! I was quietly contemplating why living beings who understand sufficiency are few, and those not repulsed by the Five Desires are many.”
The World Honoured One sighed and said, “Very good! Very good! It is just as you say. Why? In antiquity there was a ruler by the name of Head-Born (Dingsheng 頂生). To the east, west, south and north, none had not submitted to his rule. He possessed the Seven Treasures: the power of a flying golden wheel, the white elephant, the magenta horse, the bright-moon pearl, the beautiful Jade-maiden wife, the sagely entourage of ministers, and the military commander [1]. A ruler with these Seven Treasures is rarely seen in the world. Further, he had one thousand sons, handsome and elegant, clever and of wide-ranging knowledge, regarded as sages by All-Under-Heaven; fierce, they subdued the multitudes like the sons of a lion. The ruler was sagely and humane, the entire world was happy to be his subjects, and the lifespan there was many tens of thousands of years. The ruler thought to himself, “I have the continent of Aparagodānīya (Juyeni 拘耶尼 / 俱耶尼) which is three million, twenty thousand li in width and breadth [2]. The populace is flourishing, the five grains are plentiful, rich households abut one another, and of whatever the world regards as rare, my kingdom has a surfeit. Although this is the case, I wish Supreme Heaven would rain down gold and silver coins for seven days and seven nights. If Heaven grants me this would that not be wonderful?”
Heaven complied and sent down the two precious types of coin, filling the realm. The brightness of the celestial treasure dazzled the kingdom. The ruler’s joy knew no measure and All-Under-Heaven respectfully offered congratulation. Daily he enjoyed himself with his officials, and the people all considered this good. His unbounded happiness continued for millions of years. Then Head-Born had another thought, “I have the western land of three million, twenty-three thousand li, the honour of the Seven Treasures, my thousand sons who illuminate the kingdom, and heaven has rained down precious coins – the world has never seen anything like this. Notwithstanding, I have heard that in the south lies Jambudvīpa (Yanfuti 閻浮提), two million, eighty thousand li in width and length, and with a huge populace. Whatever is sought there is obtained. If I got that land, would that not be pleasing?”
As soon as that thought took shape the wheel headed south, the Seven Treasures and Four Armies, rose lightly and all flew to that land. The ruler of Jambudvīpa, his officials and people were all happy to follow Head-Born, and lord and subject united in joy when Head-Born stopped to instruct and convert them. A similar number of years passed as above. The ruler had another thought, “I had the western land, and now I have the southern land. Of the many precious things treasured by celestials and men, which have I sought and not obtained? Now, I have heard of the southern land of Pūrvavideha (Fuyudai 弗于逮), a territory of three million, sixty thousand li. The ruler and people of that land have treasures and grains of great value, they want for nothing. If I were to obtain that land, would it not be pleasing?”
No sooner had these words formed in his mouth than the golden wheel turned east and the Seven Treasures and Four Armies flew there together. The ruler of Pūrvavideha his officials and the common folk, were all delighted to be included under the purview of Head-Born. Once again, he humanely converted the ruler and his people with the True Law and as many years passed as did above, moral conduct prevailing in each and every household. The ruler had another thought, “I have the western, southern and eastern lands, and there the celestial beings and men lack nothing when it comes to precious jewels. But now I have heard of Uttarakuru (Yudanyue 欝單曰) in the north, if I got to rule over it would that not be wonderful?”
As soon as he opened his mouth to express this sentiment the golden wheel set off in a northerly direction, and the Seven Treasures and Four Armies all flew off as before. As soon as he entered its borders, he saw from afar its land was as blue-green as the feathers of a kingfisher. The ruler asked, “Have you observed the blue-green colour of the ground?”
“I see it,” was the reply.
The ruler said, “This is the land of Uttarakuru.”
He also said, “Have you observed the white on the ground?”
“I see it,” he said in reply.
The ruler said, “This is like pounded rice, you can eat it.”
Further they saw jewelled trees with soft, exquisite garments, bracelets, rings and necklaces and all kinds of rarities hanging from them. The ruler said, “Can you see those?”
Head-Born replied, “Of course!”
The ruler said, “They are for you to wear.”
Head-Born governed with humaneness and converted the populace by the example he set. He lived there for a similar number of years as above. Once again, a thought arose, “I had three continents of the word and now I have gained the northerly continent of four hundred thousand li, I yearn to rise to the dwelling place of Śakra, King of the Gods (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), in the Trayastriṃśa Heaven (Daoli Tian 忉利天).”
As Head-Born began to think in such a way the golden wheel began to ascend, and the Seven Treasures and Four Armies flew up into the sky and entered into Śakra’s Palace. Śakra saw Head-Born had arrived and came to welcome him saying, “Many’s the time I have thought of your exalted name and have long hoped to meet you. Your flight here has delighted me!”
He grasped his hand and they sat together on the same seat. Head-Born looked all around him and observed the Celestial Palace. Yellow gold and white silver, crystal, beryl, coral, amber, conch and pearl had been used in the building of the Palace, and seeing it he felt elated, and a thought quickly arose, “I possess the Four Kingdoms, with numberless jewels and coin, but this glory is difficult to describe; were the Heavenly Sovereign to perish, I could take his place -- would that not fulfil my ultimate desire?”
No sooner had this evil thought arisen did his divine powers dissipate. Śakra returned him to his old palace and he immediately contracted a serious illness. His chancellor enquired, “Your Heavenly Majesty’s condition is very serious. In the event of your passing, do you have any wishes?”
Head-Born said, “If anyone asks what caused the death of his sovereign tell them what you observed. My illness was caused by greed and that killed me. Now, greed is the blade which destroys life, the basis for the destruction of the kingdom. Distance yourself from the Three Honoured Ones and you will find yourself on one of the Three Unfortunate Roads [3]. Greed is the reason. Admonish my successors that greed and ignorance are the source of the fire that immolates the body. Be vigilant and do not covet! The perils of the glorious and respected are great, the resentments of the rich are legion.”
Head-Born died, and his successors took note of the admonishment on greed and passed it down the generations as a precious legacy.  The people of the Four Continents respected this kindness and converted, honouring the Three Honoured Ones, putting into practice the Ten Good Behaviours and using them as models for governance.
  The World Honoured One said, “Observe! Few are able to reject glory and riches and eliminate the Five Desires. Only those who have entered the stream, Once-Returners, Non-Returners, Ones Deserving of Respect (arhats), Ones Awakened to Causation Alone (pratyekabuddhas), ones who have attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening, Charioteers of the Dharma [3], and Teachers of Gods and Men are able to sever the desires. The Flying Emperor (cakravartin) immediately got his wish and nothing prevented him getting what his heart desired because it was the result of his practicing the Six Pāramitās  in his former lives giving (dāna), upholding the rules (śīla), forbearance (kṣanti), effort (vīrya), meditation (dhyāna), and wisdom (prajñā). This situation did not arrive from thin air. King Head-Born was me.”
The Buddha finished preaching and Ānanda was delighted and bowed before the Buddha.
  Notes:
[1] These are the treasures of the cakravartin (wheel tuning) king. It is not entirely clear what a “bright-moon” or  “full-moon pearl” 明月珠 is: Yu notes (2013 [105], 70 and notes 39 and 40) it is “jewellery that shines. According to some, it is a kind of diamond; to others, it refers to the eye of the whale.”
[2] Li 里 is a Chinese measure of distance equating to roughly a third of a mile. I have kept these precise measurements in the translation rather than convert to miles as I have done elsewhere because these measurements are the same as those found in the Da loutan jing 大樓炭經 (*Lokasthāna-prajñaptipāda), translated by Fali 法立 (d.u.) and Faju 法炬 (265-316) between 290-307 which has implications for the date of the inclusion of this story into the LDJJ.

"《六度集經》卷4：「（四一）普明王經聞如是：一時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。佛告諸比丘：「昔者菩薩為大國王，名曰普明，慈惠光被，十方歌懿，民[3]賴其休，猶慈子之寧親也。隣國有王，治法以[4]正，力如師子，走攫飛鳥。宰人[5]亡肉，晨[6]犇市索，路覩新屍，取之為肴，味兼畜肉。後日為饌，甘不如焉。王責太官，宰人歸誠叩頭首之。王心恧然曰：『人肉甘乎？』默勅宰人以斯為常。」世尊曰：「夫厚於味者即仁道薄，仁道薄者犲狼心興，夫為狼，[7]苟貪肉味而賊物命，故天下讎焉。宰人承命，默行殺人，以供王欲，臣民嗷嗷。表聞尋賊，王曰宜然。密告宰人曰：『慎之哉！』有司獲之。賊曰：『王命爾矣。』群臣諫曰：『臣聞，王者為德仁法，帝[8]精明即日月[9]濟等，后土潤齊乾坤，含懷眾生即若虛空，爾乃可為天下王耳。若違仁從殘，即犲狼之類矣。去明就闇，瞽者之[10]疇矣；[A6]替濟自沒，即坏舟之等矣。釋潤崇枯，即火旱之喪矣；背空向窒，即石人之心也矣。夫狼殘瞽[11]闇坏沒火燒石人之操，不可為宰人之監，豈可為天下王耶？若崇上德即昌，好殘賊則亡。二義臧否，惟王何之？』王曰：『孩童絕湩其可乎？』曰：『不可。』王曰：『余如之矣。』群臣僉曰：『犲狼不可育，無道不可君。』臣民齊心同聲逐焉。「王奔入山，覩見神樹，稽首辭曰：『令余反國，貢神百王。』誓畢即行，伺諸王出突眾取之，猶鷹鷂之撮鷰雀，執九十九王。樹神人現顏華非凡，謂阿群曰：『爾為無道以喪王榮，今復為[12]元酷，將欲何望乎？』阿群前趣之，忽然不現。「時，普明王，出察民苦樂，道逢梵志，梵志曰：『大王還宮，吾欲有言。』王曰：『昨命當出，信言難違。道士進坐，吾旋在今。』[13]遂出為阿群所獲，投之樹下，王曰：『不懼喪身，恨毀吾信耳。』阿群曰：『何謂耶？』王具說道士見己之誓，願一覩之，受其重戒，尠寶貢焉，旋死不恨。阿群放之，還覩道士，躬敷高座，道士昇座，即說偈言：「『劫數終訖，  乾坤[14]烔然， 須彌巨海，  都為灰[15]焬。 天龍福盡，  于中[16]凋喪， 二儀尚殞，  國有何常？ 生老病死，  [1]輪轉無際， 事與願違，  憂悲為害。 欲深禍高，  瘡疣無外， 三界都苦，  國有何賴？ 有本自無，  因緣成諸， 盛者必衰，  實者必虛。 眾生蠢蠢，  都緣幻居， 聲響俱空，  國土亦如。 識神無形，  駕乘四蛇， 無明寶[A7]象，  以為樂車。 形無常主，  神無常家， 三界皆幻，  豈有國耶？』 「受偈畢，即貢金錢萬二千。梵志重[2]誡之曰：『爾存四非常，其禍必滅矣。』王曰：『敬諾，不敢替明[＊]誡。』即至樹所，含笑且行。阿群曰：『命危在今，何欣且笑？』答曰：『世尊之言，三界希聞。吾今懷之，何國命之可惜乎？』阿群媚曰：『願聞尊教。』王即以四偈授之，驚喜歎曰：『巍巍世尊，陳四非常，夫不聞覩，所謂悖狂。』即解百王，各令還國。「阿群悔過自新，依樹為居，日存四偈，命終神遷，為王太子，納妻不男。王重憂之，因募國女化之令男，後遂[3]妷蕩不從真道。王恚之焉，磔著四衢，命行人曰：『以指[4]确首，苟辱之矣。』適九十九人，而太子薨。魂靈變化，輪轉無已，值佛在世，生舍衛國。早喪其父，孤與母居。事梵志道，性篤言信，勇力[5]擘象，師愛友敬，遐邇稱賢，師每周旋輙委以居。師妻懷嬖，援其手婬辭誘之。阿群辭曰：『凡世耆友，男吾父之，女吾母焉，豈況師之所敬乎？燒身可從，斯亂不敢順矣。』師妻恧然，退思為變。婿歸，婦曰：『子歎彼賢，足照子否矣？』具為其過。女妖似真，梵志信矣。師告阿群：『爾欲仙乎？』對曰：『唯然。』曰：『爾殺百人，斬取其指，今獲神仙。』奉命携劒，逢人輙殺，獲九十九人指，眾[6]犇國震。覩母欣曰：『母至數足，吾今仙矣。』佛念：『邪道惑眾，普天斯[7]疇也。』化為沙門在其前步，曰：『人數足矣。』追後不屬，曰：『沙門可止！』答曰：『吾止久矣，惟爾不焉。』曰：『止義云何？』答曰：『吾惡都止，爾惡熾矣。』阿群心開，霍如雲除，五體投地，頓首悔過。叉手尋[8]從，將還精舍，即為沙門。佛為說宿行，現四非常，得溝[9]港道，退于樹下，閉目叉手練去餘垢，進取無著。「王召軍師戰士數萬，尋捕妖賊，未知所之。道過佛所，曰：『王自何來？身蒙塵土。』對曰：『國有妖賊殺無[10]過民，今尋捕之。』世尊告曰：『夫民先修德而退崇邪，治國之政其法何之？』對曰：『先貴後賤，正法治之。』『若夫先[11]戴畜心退懷聖德，正法何之？』對曰：『先賤後貴正法[12]賞之。』曰：『賊已釋邪崇真，今為沙門矣。』王歎曰：『善哉！如來、無所著、正真道、最正覺、道法御、天人師，神妙上化乃至于茲乎！始為犲狼，今為天仁。』稽首足下，又重歎曰：『斯化奇矣，願一覩之。』世尊曰：『可。』王逮官屬，造之而曰：『上德賢者可一開眼相面乎？』如斯三矣。答曰：『吾之眼[13]睛，耀射難當。』王稽首曰：『明日設微饌，願一顧眄。』答曰：『於廁吾往，於殿則[14]不。』王曰：『[＊]唯命。』還則裂廁，掘其地則新之，樟梓[A8]𣑮材，為之柱梁，香湯沃地，栴檀蘇合欝金諸香，和之為泥，[15]旃罽雜繒，以為座席，[16]彫文刻鏤，眾寶為好。煒煒煌煌，有踰殿堂。明日王身，捧香鑪迎之。阿群就座，王褰衣膝行，供養訖畢，即說經曰：『廁前日之污，豈可於飯乎？』對曰：『不可。』曰：『今可乎？』曰：『可矣。』阿群曰：『吾未覩佛時，事彼妖蠱，心存口言身行諸邪，邪道穢化其為臭污，甚彼溷矣。屎污可洗，穢染難除，賴蒙宿祚生值佛世，沐浴清化去臭懷香，內外清淨猶天真珠，夫不覩佛、不知四非常者，觀其志趣，猶狂者醉之以酒矣，不親賢眾而依十惡者，其與犲狼共檻乎！』王曰：『善哉！奇乎佛之至化，乃令廁臭化為栴檀矣。』「說經竟，即邁歷市，聞有婦人逆產者命在呼吸。還如事啟，佛言：『爾往為其產。』阿群恧然。世尊曰：『爾望產云：「吾自生來，慈向眾生，潤濟乾坤者。」爾母子俱全矣。』受教而往，至宣佛恩，母子俱生。退還尋塗，疑己有殺人之酷，而云普慈，稽首質焉。佛告阿群：『凡人心開受道之日，可謂始生者也。不覩三尊，未受重戒，猶兒處胎，雖[17]其有目，將亦何覩？有耳何聞？故曰未生也。』阿群心開，即得應真道。」佛告諸比丘：「昔時普明者，吾身是也。吾前世授之四偈，一活百王，今令得道，不受重罪矣。阿群宿命甞為比丘，負米一斛送著寺中，上作刀一枚，歡喜歎尊，稽首而去。負米獲多力，上刀獲多寶，歡喜獲端正，歎尊獲為王，作禮故為國人所拜。九十九人[1]确其首，遂至喪身，故[2]殺前怨而斬其指。後人欲[＊]确，見其已喪，又覩沙門，更有慈心。後人即其母，始有惡意故，阿群始意亦惡，覩沙門更慈故，見佛即孝。種淳得淳，種雜得雜，善惡已施，禍福尋之，影追響應，皆有所由，非[3]徒自然也。比丘願言：『令汝逢佛得道。』如願獲焉。供養三尊，有若絲髮；沙門以慈呪願施者言，如其言，得，萬無一失。菩薩執志度無極行持戒如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 22b16-24a11)[3] 賴【大】，願【宋】【元】【明】　[4] 正【大】，政【宋】【元】【明】　[5] 亡【大】，劫【元】【明】　[6] 犇【大】，奔【宋】【元】【明】　[7] 苟【大】，狗【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 精【大】，釋【元】【明】　[9] 濟【大】，齊【宋】【元】【明】　[10] 疇【大】，儔【宋】【元】【明】　[A6] CBETA 按：此《大正藏》本「替」字在《高麗藏》本《新集藏經音義隨函錄》（K34n1257_p0846a04）錄作「譛」字，有讀者反應此二字疑作「潜」字。今見本經的對校本《高麗藏》（K11n0206_p0315a01）、《思溪藏》（中國國家圖書館藏第1488冊第42圖第6行）、《福州藏》（日本宮內庁書陵部藏大藏經第1706帖第22圖第15行）及《磧砂藏》（Q11n0221_p0072b26）皆作「替」。在未確知其意下，保留諸本所錄字。 　[11] 闇【大】，閉【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 元【大】，無【宋】　[13] 遂【大】，逐【元】【明】　[14] 烔【大】，洞【元】【明】　[15] 焬【大】，揚【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 凋【大】，彫【宋】　[1] 輪轉【大】，轉輪【明】　[A7] 象【CB】，養【大】(cf.

The people looked to him to provide respite as a loving child looks to his parents. The neighbouring kingdom had a ruler [1] who governed correctly. He was as strong as a lion and ran fast enough to snatch a bird in flight. A butcher found himself lacking meat and early one morning he was hastening to the market to search some out when by the side of the road he saw a newly dead corpse. He took it to use in his dishes thinking its flavour equal to that of domestic animals. The following day he cooked it and it was incomparably delicious. The ruler interrogated the Grand Provisioner [2], and the butcher banging his head on the ground confessed what he had done. The ruler looked ashamed and said, “How could the flesh of men taste so sweet?”
In secret he ordered the butcher to serve him this meat often.
The World Honoured One continued:
Now, those who place great weight on flavour tend to tread light on the path of humaneness, and in those who tread light on the path of humaneness the heart of a vicious wolf can arise. Now, wolves crave the flavours of flesh and steal the lives of others; that is why the world regards them with enmity. The butcher followed his instructions and carried on murdering people on the quiet to give the King what he craved. The officials and people wept in distress and petitioned that this murderer be sought out. The King declared such action appropriate. Yet he secretly warned the butcher, saying, “Be cautious!” 
An official arrested the butcher, and the murderer said, “The King made me to do it!” 
The assembled officials admonished the monarch saying, “Your officials have heard that when a king models himself on virtue and humaneness, such a monarch is the equal of the sun and moon; his lands will be nourished equally by Heaven and Earth, and all the beings he cherishes are as if empty of care [3]. Such a one is fit to rule All-under-Heaven! To turn your back on humaneness and pursue the cruel is to be kin to the vicious wolf; to depart from the bright and head to the dark is to be one with the blind man; to abandon a rescue and sink yourself is like being a damaged boat; to dissipate moisture and look favourably on the withered is to invite the calamity of fire during a drought; to turn your back on the open and face the inaccessible is to be as foolish as a ‘man of stone’. Now, one who displays a wolf’s viciousness, a blind man’s darkness, damages the boat and sinks himself, encourages destruction by fire, and acts like the stupid ‘man of stone’ is not fit to supervise a butcher, let alone rule All-under-Heaven. If you exalt the highest virtue you will prosper, but if you are fond of viciousness and murder you will perish. Of these two options, Your Majesty, consider which is it to be?”
The King said, “Would you deprive a babe of its mother’s milk?”
They said, “Of course not!”
The King said, “My situation is analogous!”
The assembled officials all said, “The vicious wolf cannot be trained; the immoral cannot rule.”
Officials and people with one mind and of the same voice chased him away.
The King fled into the mountains where he saw a divine tree and bowed before it saying, “If you can return me to my kingdom I will offer your divinity one hundred rulers as tribute.” 
Having made this vow, he set off to fulfil it. He waited until a ruler set out, then charged into his entourage and snatched him, like a raptor plucking a songbird from the sky. Having seized ninety-nine monarchs the tree spirit appeared, his magnificent appearance out of the ordinary, and said to [King] Aṅgulimāla (Aqun 阿群) [1], “You destroyed your royal honour because of your immoral behaviour, now once again you are acting with enormous cruelty. What do you hope to achieve?”
Aṅgulimāla advanced on him but he immediately disappeared.
 At that time King Universal Brightness was setting out to assess the hardships and joys of his people. On the road he came across a brahmin who addressed him saying, “Great Majesty! Return to the palace, I wish to speak with you.”
The King said, “Yesterday I issued the orders and I ought to go. I cannot go back on my word. Sir, go within and take a seat, I will return later in the day.”
No sooner had he set out than he was captured by Aṅgulimāla and flung at the foot of the tree. The King said, “I do not fear death, but I do regret the destruction of trust in me.”
Aṅgulimāla said, “What are you talking about?”
He told him all about the promise he had made to the ascetic to see him later. He vowed that as soon as he had seen him, received his important admonitions, and made a small offering of precious items to him, he would then return and die without regret. Aṅgulimāla released him and he returned to see the ascetic. He personally set out a high seat to which the ascetic ascended and expounded these verses:
  Come the conclusion of the kalpa,
Heaven and Earth will blaze bright.
Sumeru and the great ocean,
Both now ash and light.
Devas and Nagas, luck expended,
Meet death in this great conflagration.
Even the Sun and Moon are doomed,
Think your kingdom eternal?
  Life, old age, sickness, and death,
Alternate without any end.
Events run counter to hopes,
And worry and sorrow bring harm.
Desire deepens, misfortunes intensify,
Suffering and calamity cannot be avoided.
The Triple World is all bitterness,
Think your kingdom secure?
  Being has roots in non-being,
Causes and conditions complete.
Whatsoever flourishes will decline,
And the full will soon be empty.
Living beings in constant motion,
Because of their illusory home.
Sound and echo, both empty,
And your kingdom is just the same!
  Consciousness has no form,
Its cart is hitched to four vipers.
In ignorance it treasures and feeds them,
Assuming they pull towards joy.
Form has no permanent master,
Spirit no permanent home.
The Three Realms are an illusion,
Are you sure your kingdom exists?
  Having received these verses, the King offered twelve thousand pieces of gold. The brahmin strongly admonished him, “If you keep in mind the Four Impermanents [4] misfortune will certainly diminish.”
The King said, “Indeed I will! I would not dare to ignore your illuminating admonitions.”
He promptly returned to the tree, smiling as he went. Aṅgulimāla said, “Your life is in imminent danger. How come you are happy and smiling?”
He replied, “The words of the World Honoured One are rarely heard in the Three Realms. Now I have taken them to heart, how can I begrudge my kingdom or my life?”
Aṅgulimāla said, attempting to flatter, “I would like to hear the Honoured One’s teachings.”
The King immediately passed on these Four Verses to him and, surprised and delighted Aṅgulimāla exclaimed in admiration, “How lofty is the World Honoured One’s exposition of the Four Impermanents! Those who have not heard and understood are totally confused!”
Immediately he released the one hundred kings and each returned to their own kingdom.
Aṅgulimāla repented of his misdeeds and made a fresh start. He made the tree his home and daily kept in mind the Four Verses and when the end of his life arrived his soul moved on and became a royal crown prince. He took a wife but was unable to behave as a man should with a woman. The King found this very concerning and so brought together women of the kingdom who might might make a man of him by seduction. After this, he became quite dissolute, and did not follow the True Way. The King was angered by this and ordered him torn limb from limb at the crossroads and instructed passers-by to hit him on the head with their fingers to humiliate him. When ninety-nine people has done so, the Crown Prince died. His soul underwent transformation going through endless revolutions until he encountered an era when the Buddha was in the world, when he was born in Śrāvastī. He lost his father very young and lived alone with his mother. He devoted himself to the Brahmin Way and was honest by nature and trustworthy. His bravery and strength were such that he could topple an elephant [5]. Loved by his master and respected by his friends, near and far his worth was extolled. Whenever his master went on his travels, he would entrust the household to him. The master’s wife took a fancy to him and showed him particular favour, grasping his hand and attempted to entice him with lewd suggestions. Aṅgulimāla demurred saying, “In this world, I regard my older friends like a father if male and like a mother if female. How much more respect will I show my master?  Set fire to me by all means, but I’ll never dare indulge in this kind of licentiousness!”
The master’s wife looked ashamed, withdrew and thought about what she had done, and had a change of plan. When her husband returned, she said, “You admire that ‘worthy’ – which is sufficient to show you are not worthy yourself!”
She explained what had happened as if it were Aṅgulimāla who had been at fault. Her womanly wiles convinced the brahmin she was telling the truth and he believed her. His master asked Aṅgulimāla, “Do you want to be an immortal?”
He replied, “Of course!”
His master said, “Then kill one-hundred people, chop off and collect a finger from each, then you will obtain the status of a divine immortal.”
He took up his sword and set off to carry out his orders. Whenever he encountered another, he would promptly kill them, and so acquired the digits of ninety-nine people. Crowds rushed away and the entire kingdom was terrified. He saw his mother and was delighted, saying “Mother has arrived to make up numbers! I’m about to become an immortal!”
The Buddha pondered on this: “Evil ways confuse the multitude; it is the same for all beings under Heaven.”
He transformed himself into a śramaṇa and walked before him. Aṅgulimāla said, “I have enough people now!”
He pursued the Buddha but could not catch up with him. “Śramaṇa, stop!” he cried.
The Buddha said, “I stopped long ago, it is you who have not.”
“What do you mean by ‘stopped’?”, asked Aṅgulimāla.
The Buddha replied, “I have put a stop to all evil; you are ablaze with it!”
Aṅgulimāla’s mind opened as suddenly as clouds disperse. He flung himself prostrate on the ground, banging his head in repentance of his misdeeds. With hands clasped in supplication he followed the śramaṇa back to his monastery and immediately became a śramaṇa himself.
The Buddha spoke to him of his conduct in past lives, and when he explained the Four Impermanents, Aṅgulimāla attained stream-entry. He returned to the bottom of the tree, closed his eyes, joined his hands together, and set about ridding himself of any remaining impurities, striving towards, and attaining non-attachment [6].
Meanwhile, the King had summoned his military advisers and many thousands of soldiers were mobilised to seek out and capture the monstrous bandit. They did not know where he had gone, and they took a route which passed by the Buddha’s place and he asked, “Where has Your Majesty been? Your Majesty is covered in dirt!”
The King replied, “There is a monstrous bandit in the kingdom who has killed innumerable [7] people. Now we are seeking him in the hope of capturing him.”
The World Honoured One said, “Now, when a person who previously cultivated virtue, later turns to revering wickedness, what do the laws governing the country decree should happen to him?”
The King replied, “If one turns from noble to base, justice would be served by execution.”
“If it were the case that one was initially endowed with the heart of a beast, but turned to embrace sagely virtue, how would justice be served?”
The King replied, “If one turned from base to noble, justice requires he be rewarded.”[8]
The Buddha said, “The bandit has relinquished evil and now reveres the True; he has become a śramaṇa.”
The King sighed. “That is wonderful!  The excellent powers of conversion of the Thus-come One, the Non-Attached, one of Supreme, Perfect Awakeniing, a Charioteer of the Dharma, a Teacher of Gods and Men, have reached such heights as these!”
He placed his head at the Buddha’s feet, and strongly praised him saying, “This conversion is extraordinary! I wish to see him.”
The World Honoured One said, “You may.”
The King and his entourage went to him and said, “Oh Worthy One of superior virtue, might you open your eyes and look upon me?”
He repeated this three times. Aṅgulimāla answered, “My eyes shoot forth a brilliance difficult to endure.”
The King bowed his head and said, “Tomorrow I have arranged a small repast, would you look in briefly?”
Aṅgulimāla replied, “If it is held in the toilet block, I will attend, but if it is in the palace I will not.”
The King replied, “Just as you wish.”
He returned and tore down the toilet block, dug out the ground and built a new one from scratch. The beams and pillars in this new block were of camphor, catalpa and cedar and the floor was washed with fragrant waters. The plaster was made from a fragrant mix of sandal, storax and turmeric; the sitting mats were carpets of various woven silks. Painted carvings and engravings and many precious things beautified the surroundings. Dazzling and brilliant, it exceeded the splendour of a palace hall. The next day the royal person held the censer himself as he went to welcome Aṅgulimāla. As soon as Aṅgulimāla sat down the King hitched up his garments and advanced towards him on his knees. When the offerings were done Aṅgulimāla explicated the scriptures saying, “Could we have eaten amidst the filth of the toilet as it was previously?”
The King replied, “It would not have been acceptable.”
Aṅgulimāla said, “Is it acceptable now?”
“Yes,” was the King’s response.
Aṅgulimāla said, “Before I had yet encountered the Buddha, when I served monstrous wickedness, evil manifested in my thoughts, words and deeds. These evil ways and the filthy teachings were considerably more fetid and putrid than any privy. While excrement and foulness themselves are easily washed off, the contamination and stain of evil are difficult to get rid of. Luckily, thanks to the legacy of my former lives I was born in an age where I could encounter a Buddha, bathed in the Pure Teachings they dispelled the stench and enveloped me in fragrance – purified within and without, I am like a heavenly pearl. Now, if you observe the inclinations of one who has not seen the Buddha and does not understand the Four Impermanents, he appears mad, drunk on wine. He does not cherish the worthy multitudes [9] and inclines towards the Ten Evils and should be confined with vicious wolves.”
The King said, “Excellent! Rare is the Buddha’s consummate transformation; it can transform the stench of the privy into the sweet smell of sandalwood.”
When he had finished explicating the scriptures Aṅgulimāla set off and as he was passing through the marketplace, he heard there was a woman in labour whose baby was in the breach position and her life hung in the balance. He went back to inform the Buddha, who said, “You go and deliver the child.”
Aṅgulimāla looked ashamed and the World Honoured said, “When the baby is delivered look at it and say, ‘Since birth I have directed my kindness towards all living beings, providing assistance to those in the heavens and the earth. Both of you, mother and child, will be well.’”
He received the Buddha’s teachings and went back. When he arrived, he announced the Buddha’s favour and mother and child both lived. As Aṅgulimāla went back along the track he had cause to doubt himself; he had been cruel killing many others, yet he had spoken of his universal kindness. Prostrating himself before the Buddha he put questions to him. The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla, “The day an ordinary person opens their mind and accepts the Way they are said to be ‘new-born’. If they have had no sight of the Three Honoured Ones, and have not yet received the weighty Rules, they are like a child in the womb; although they have eyes, can they see? They have ears, but can they hear? Thus, they are said to be ‘not yet born’.”
Aṅgulimāla’s mind opened and he immediately became an arhat.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “In former times, Universal Brilliance was me. In a previous life, I gave Aṅgulimāla the Four Verses, and at once he let the one hundred kings live. Now I have caused him to attain the Way and avoid weighty punishments. In a previous lifetime, Aṅgulimāla was once a bhikṣu who carried a bushel of rice on his back to present to a monastery together with a blade. He joyfully praised the Honoured Ones, bowed and left. In carrying the rice, he gained much strength, in giving the blade he gained many treasures, his joy gained him rectitude, his praise gained him kingship, and because he made obeisance, he is now the object of the kingdom’s respects. It was because of the resentment he felt prior to his death against the ninety-nine men who had hit him on the head following which he expired, that he chopped off their fingers. The next person queuing to hit him saw he was already dead, then also saw a śramaṇa, and developed a kind heart. This latter person then became his mother in another life and because from the start she harboured evil intent, so did Aṅgulimāla begin to likewise. But because she saw a śramaṇa and became kind, when he saw the Buddha he became filial. Plant the pure, reap the pure; plant the sullied, reap the sullied. Once good or evil have been done, disaster or good fortune will follow accordingly. Shadows pursue and echoes respond, each has their cause, they do not simply appear spontaneously. The bhikṣu’s vow states, ‘May you encounter a Buddha and attain the Way.’ And in accordance with this vow, rewards will be reaped. Provide for the Three Honoured Ones with great care as if handling a strand of silk. Śramaṇas! If you make this vow with kindness and a desire to give you will attain whatever you request!” 
  The Bodhisattva’s resolute, limitless practice of obedience to the rules is like this.

[1] This ruler’s name is Aṅgulimāla (Aqun 阿群), but this does not become clear till later in the story. In fact, this is Aṅgulimāla in a previous life.
[2] The ‘Grand Provisioner’ (taiguan 太官) was the official responsible for preparing meals for the palace and the court (Hucker, entry number 6185).
[3] I have added “of care” (which does not appear in the Chinese) here to make sense of the statement that “all the beings he cherishes are empty.” There is no Chinese equivalent and my addition is tentative.
[4] That is, the subject matter of these verses. The ‘Four Impermanents’ are defined elsewhere in early translations as ‘impermanent’ wuchang 無常 (anitya), ‘suffering’, ku 苦 (duḥkha), ‘empty’, kong 空 (śūnya), and ‘non-self’, feishen 非身 (anātman).. These four verses appear in almost identical form in the Sutra of the Wise and the Foolish (Xianyu jing 賢愚經) T. Vol. 4 No. 202, 426b21-c4 and in the in the Humane Kings Perfection of Wisdom Sutra (Renwang bore boluomi jing 仁王般若波羅蜜經T08n0245_p0830b05 and in. They are often referred to as the ‘Four Verses on Impermanence’ (si wuchang jie 四無常偈).
[5] Reading the variant bi 躃 with the Yuan and Mind editions of the canon.
[6] That is, he became an arhat.
[7] Reading the variant liang 量 with the Song, Yuan and Ming editions of the canon.
[8] It is possible that there ais a pun employed here: zheng fa 正法, ‘the correct law/method’, in Buddhist texts is used as a translation of sad-dharma,  specifically the Buddha’s teachings, but it can also mean capital punishment. I have tried to reflect this potential pun in my translation.
[9] ‘worthy multitudes’ (xianzhong 賢衆) is probably a reference to Buddhists generally or more specifically members of the sangha."

For this reason he concealed his brightness and stored away his shadow staying among graves and practicing forbearance.
Amidst the graves there was a calf, and the Bodhisattva often collected its faeces and urine to eat and drink to prolong his life [1]. Exposed to the elements as he concentrated his thoughts in meditation, his countenance had become burnt black and unsightly. Everyone found him abhorrent. When the people of the kingdom saw him, they said to one another, “There goes a demon!”
Everyone who saw him spat on him, cursed him or hit him with lumps of earth or with stones. But the Bodhisattva remained without a scintilla of anger, his kind heart pained, he said, “Does it not grieve one? These people have not seen the Buddhist scriptures and do such evil.”
He made a vow saying, “When I am a Thus-Come One, One Without Ties, One of Supreme, Perfect Awakening, I will certainly save these people.”
The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.

He resolutely practiced universal kindness which nourished all living beings. He felt great compassion for those who had not had a chance to encounter the Three Honoured Ones. He took his parents to live in the mountain wilderness. His mother and father were old and had lost their sight in both eyes. Shan was grieved by this and whenever he spoke of it, wept. Each night he would rise three times to ensure they were neither too hot nor too cold. Such was his consummate filial behaviour that the fragrance of his virtue perfumed the heavens: hence did the earth spirits, the sea dragons and the people of the kingdom come to know of it. He observed the Buddha’s Ten Good Behaviours; he refrained from killing living things, was so honest he would leave lost items by the roadside, maintained chastity and did not marry, thus putting an end to the transgressions of the body; he had cut off all the faults of the mouth by never being inconstant, abusive, untrue, improper, slandering, noxious or false in speech; all impurities of the mind, the mental afflictions of jealousy, hatred, and greed, had all been quietened. He believed good behaviour would bring good fortune and doing evil would bring bad. He built his hut from thatch and his mat was made from weeds. He was pure and had no desires and his resolve was like heavenly gold. The mountain had a pool arising from a spring and lotus flowers grew upon it. Diverse sweet fruits grew all around its banks and rising early he would gather them, and never had any tasted sweeter. His humaneness illuminated distant places and birds and beasts came close, trusting him. Whenever his parents were thirsty, he went to draw water.
The ruler of the city of Kapilavastu (Jiayiguo 迦夷國) went into the mountains to hunt. He drew his bow and shot an arrow in an attempt to shoot a mountain deer, but mistakenly hit Shan in the chest. The poison from the arrow flowed into Shan and the pain he felt was difficult to articulate. Turning his head to the left and right tears flowing he cried loudly, “Who has killed three ascetics with one arrow? My parents are old and both blind – a morning without me will mean death for them both.”
In a loud voice he lamented, “The elephant is hunted for his tusks, the rhinoceros for his horn and kingfisher for his plumage. I have neither tusks, horn, nor dazzling plumage. Why must I die?”
The ruler heard this lament and dismounted from his horse and asked, “What were you doing so deep in these mountains?”
He answered, “I brought my parents to live in this mountain to be free of the world’s many defilements and to advance my study of the Way.”
The ruler heard Shan’s words and tears flowed as he choked with sobs, deeply moved by the situation. He said, “I have acted in an inhumane manner and have destroyed lives and what’s more I have killed one of consummate filiality.”
He wailed, “How can I bear this?”
His officials, junior and senior, were all too choked to speak. The ruler said, emphatically, “I would give my kingdom for your life. I hope you will take me to your parents – I wish to admit my guilt.”
He said, “Then follow that small path and not far along you will come across a small thatched hut; my parents are within. Tell them I make my final farewell from here having met a fortunate death and that during their remaining years they must take care not to regret my passing.”
Once again, his lamentations went up, and all at once he was gone. The ruler and his numerous men again expressed their deep sorrow and went off in search of his parents’ place down the path he had shown them. The ruler’s retinue was large and the noise they made as they passed through the undergrowth disturbed the tranquillity. The parents heard them and suspected that a stranger approached. They asked, “Who’s there?”
The ruler said, “It is I, the ruler of the kingdom of Kapilavastu.”
The parents said, “It is wonderful that Your Majesty should stop here! Here take a rest on this grass mat and eat some sweet fruits. Our son will draw you some water – he will return any moment.”
The ruler observed his parents speaking of their son with such tenderness, he choked with sobs again and addressed the parents saying, “I see you two good people regard your son with such tenderness and my heart is sincerely grieved, and I am pained beyond measure. I shot and killed the ascetic, your son, Shan.”
The parents were seized with terror and said, “What crime had our son committed that you killed him? Our son was committed to humaneness and compassion; even when treading on the ground he feared he was hurting the earth, what crime could he possibly have committed that His Majesty would kill him?”
The ruler replied, “A son of consummate filiality truly is of the outstanding worth! I was aiming at a deer and accidentally hit him.”
They said, “Our son is dead! Who will we rely on in future? We will die now! Our only wish is that your Great Majesty will lead us two old folk to the place our son lies dead. It is sure to be the end of us, but it is in the hope that we can turn into dust together.”
When the ruler heard the parents’ words, once again he was sorely grieved, and led the parents himself to the place where their son’s corpse lay. The father placed his head on his son’s knees and the mother embraced her son’s feet, kissing his mouth and feet, each running their hands over the wound caused by the arrow. They beat their breasts and slapped their faces and lifting up their heads cried out saying, “Gods of the Heavens, Gods of the Earth, Tree Gods and Water Gods, our son Shan respected the Buddha and trusted in his Law. He respected the worthy and was filial to his parents, he embraced limitless wide-ranging humaneness, he was even kind to plants and trees.”
They continued, “If our son was indeed sincere in his respect for the Buddha and his consummate filiality, then let this become known in the Heavens; when the arrow is removed the powerful poison will dissipate, and our son will get to live and continue his consummate filiality till the end. If his conduct does not measure up and our words are not sincere, then we ought to die and all be reduced to dust.”
The King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), the Four Great Heavenly Kings, the earth spirits, and the sea dragons heard the sound of the parents’ laments, and trusting their words, there were none who were not disturbed by the situation. Śakra descended and said to the parents, “I can make this son of consummate filiality live.”
He poured some divine medicine into Shan’s mouth and suddenly he revived.
The father, the mother, Shan, the ruler and his retinue of officials, all felt joy and sadness in equal measure and cries rose up once again. The ruler said, “The power of respect for the Buddha, and the practice of consummate filiality, leads to this!”
Then he issued an order to his gathered officials, “From this day forward, the people within my boundaries will all uphold the conduct mandated by the Buddha’s Ten Virtuous Good Behaviours and put into practice the consummate filial behaviour of Shan.”
The entire kingdom complied with this order, and afterwards the kingdom flourished and the people were at ease ushering in an era of Great Peace [1].
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
 “Age upon age I worshipped the Buddhas and practiced consummate filiality. My virtue was lofty and my good fortune flourished and I became a God among Gods, unrivalled in the Triple World. At that time Shan was me; the ruler was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難); Shan’s father was my current father and my mother was Māyā (Shemiao 舍妙). Śakra was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒).
  The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.

He lived beneath a tree in the mountain wilderness and concentrated his thoughts in meditation. Fruits and spring waters were his food and drink. His inner impurities had been completely eliminated and he dwelt in empty quietude developing three kinds of powers from the Six Supernatural Penetrations [1] and reaching a full understanding of them. The aroma of his fame for wisdom permeated the Eight Directions, the zenith and the nadir, and the Buddhas of the Ten Directions, those who have taken the path of Awakening to Causation Alone (pratyekabuddhas), Ones Deserving of Respect (arhats), and all the sages, all sighed. Śakra, Brahma and the Four Great Heavenly Kings, sea dragons and earth spirits, respectfully pious morning and evening, raised their hands in salute and bowed their heads in respect, and accepting his teachings protected the kingdom; the winds and rains came at the appropriate moment and the five grains were harvested in abundance, dangers were dispelled and calamities eliminated; lord and vassal both flourished. The ruler’s name was Jiali (迦梨) and he went into the mountains to hunt. He set off in pursuit of a deer and following its tracks he passed before the Bodhisattva. The ruler asked the ascetic, “The tracks of the beast pass here, do you know where it went?”
The Bodhisattva thought silently to himself, “The lives of living beings are totally chaotic, and they act only for themselves. Fearing death, they crave life, but am I any different at heart? If I were I to tell the King, he would violently slaughter the deer without mercy, and I would be just as guilty as the King; yet if I were to tell the King I have not seen the deer I would be practicing deceit.”
He felt ashamed and lowering his head said nothing. The King got angry and said, “You deserve to die, beggar! I am the reigning monarch and have the respect of the entire kingdom, yet I ask you a question and receive no timely reply while you deceitfully hang your head!”
The kingdom was well known for a particular gesture of the fingers to express the negative. The Bodhisattva was disconsolate: should he use his fingers to communicate ‘no’?[2] He showed them and it was interpreted by the King as him claiming to not having seen the deer. The King said, “The animal tracks go right past here yet you claim not to have seen anything? The King’s authority is unlimited – think I couldn’t have you put to death?”
The Bodhisattva said, “I hear Your Majesty.”
The King asked, “Who are you?”
The Bodhisattva replied, “I am a man of forbearance.”
The King was furious and pulled out his sword and chopped off the Bodhisattva’s right arm. The Bodhisattva thought, “I am focused on the higher Way, I have no conflict with the times, but if this King strikes even me with his blade, how must he treat the common folk? I vow that when I attain Buddhahood, I will certainly save him first of all so that other living beings will not model themselves on his evil conduct.”
The King said, “So, who are you?”
The Bodhisattva replied, “I am a man of forbearance.”
With that the King severed his left hand. Each time he asked, his answer was met with a blow of the sword, chopping off his feet, his ears and his nose; blood flowed like the waters from a spring and his pain was beyond measure. Heaven and Earth shook and the sun went dark. The Four Great Heavenly Kings all arrived as one and together furiously proclaimed, “This king’s brutality is withour equal.”
They addressed the ascetic saying, “Don’t defile yourself because of this! To demonstrate the King’s evil we will put him and his wife and children to death and annihilate his entire kingdom.”
The ascetic replied, “What are you saying? This calamity derives from my former lives when I did not uphold the Buddha’s teachings and harmed others. If one does evil, misfortune will follow, as surely as shadow is tied to form. If in former times we planted a little, we will now reap a lot. If I were to comply with your orders this would be an offence of a similar magnitude to the Heavens and the Earth combined, and I would endure bad fortune for many kalpas. Where would it end?”
The common folk had observed this unexpected turn of events and rushed to him to confess to their transgressions and chorused, “Ascetic! Your living here has provided auspicious protection which nourishes the kingdom, averting disaster and eliminating pestilence; yet this stupidest of rulers, who does not understand what to prize and what to disparage and is unclear on what should be dispelled and what should be encouraged, inflicts evil on you, Foremost among Sages. All we ask, Oh Sage, is that you do not report us to the Heavenly Sovereign!”
The Bodhisattva replied saying, “The King, with a wickedness for which he is not responsible, inflicted agonies on my body. I am as caring as a compassionate mother is to her new-born babe; what transgressions of you ordinary people could have angered me? If you harbour any misgivings grab my severed arms and bring them here.”
The people immediately got them and milk poured from them. He said, “This illustrates the truth of my being as caring as a compassionate mother.”
Seeing this expanded their trust and none did not accept the teachings and return home joyful.
The Bodhisattva had a younger brother who also had understood the primacy of the Way and lived on a different mountain. With the penetrating vision of his divine eye, he observed the assembly of celestial gods, ghosts and dragons discussing the King’s wickedness. None of them were not furious about what had occurred. Fearing his brother may have done damage to his virtuous heart, he used his divine powers to go to his brother’s place. He asked, “Are you injured anywhere?”
He replied, “No. If you wish to test whether what I say is trustworthy, get my severed hands, feet, ears and nose and stick them back in their old places; if are restored, that will show I am to be trusted.”
The younger brother collected them and were immediately restored to their original state, and the elder said, “The truth of my universal compassion has now been made evident.”
The Gods of the Heavens and the Spirits of the Earth were all deeply moved with delight. They bowed their heads to the ground and extolled his goodness and encouraged one another to keep their resolve to maintain the highest standards of conduct. They all accepted the Rules and retired. From this time on the sun and the moon did not shine and the Five Celestial Bodies no longer moved across the firmament as they should and strange portents followed one after the other. There was a severe drought and grain became expensive. The people’s difficulties were blamed on their King.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“At that time Chantihe was me; my younger brother was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒) and the King was the arhat Kauṇḍinya (Julin 拘隣).”
  The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.
  Notes:
[1] Reading hongming liutong 弘明六通 as sanming liutong 三明六通 as I suspect there has been a scribal error here. The former appears only here and in the precis of this story contained in the Jinglü yixiang 經律異相 (T 2121, 40b22-23) whereas the latter appears hundreds of times in the canon. The three kinds of supranormal cognition are the power of divine vision, the power of the knowledge of previous lifetimes and the power of the extinction of contamination.

"《六度集經》卷5：「（四五）「昔者菩薩，生於貧家，貧家不育，以[25]褻裹之，夜無人時，默置四[26]街，并錢一千送著其[27]道。國俗以斯日為吉祥之日，率土野會，君子小人，各以其類盛饌快樂。梵志[28]覩戲，讚會者曰：『嗟[29]于今日會[30]者！別有如[31]粳米純白無糅，厥香苾芬。若夫今日產[32]生男女，貴而且賢。』坐中有一理家，獨而無嗣，聞之默喜，令人四布索棄子者，使問路人曰：『覩有棄[33]子者乎？』路人曰：『有獨母取焉。』使人尋之，得其所在，曰：『吾四姓富而無嗣，爾以兒貢，可獲眾寶。』母曰：『可留錢送兒，從欲索貨。』母獲如志。育兒數月，而婦姙[34]身，曰：『吾以無嗣故育異[35]姓，天授余祚，今[36]以子為？』以[＊]褻裹之夜著[37]汫中。家羊日就而乳，牧人尋察覩兒，即歎曰：『上帝何緣落其子[38]於茲乎？』取歸育之以羊湩乳。四姓覺[39]知，[40]誥曰：『緣竊[41]湩乎？』對曰：『吾獲天之遺子，以湩育之。』四姓悵悔。還育數月，婦遂產男，惡念更生，又[42]復如前以[＊]褻裹之著車轍中，兒心存佛三寶，慈向其親。「晨有商人數百乘車，徑路由茲，牛躓不進，商人察其所以，覩兒驚曰：『天帝之子，何緣在茲乎？』抱著車中，牛進若流，前二十里息牛[1]亭側，有獨母白商人乞曰：『以兒相惠濟吾老窮。』即惠之矣。母育未幾，四姓又聞，愴然而曰：『吾之不仁殘天德乎？』又以眾寶請兒歸家，哽噎自責，等育二兒。數年之間，覩兒之智奇變縱橫，惡念又生曰：『斯明溢度，吾兒否哉，必虜之矣。』[2]褻裹入山，[3]棄著竹中絕食必殞。兒興慈念曰：『吾後得佛，必濟眾苦矣。』山近谿水，兒自力搖從竹[4]墮地，展轉至其水側。去水二十里，有[5]擔死人𨽁，𨽁[6]有[7]人行取樵，遙見小兒，就視歎曰：『上帝落其子乎？』抱歸育焉。四姓又聞，厥恨如前，以眾名寶請歸悲泣，并教書數仰觀俯占，眾道之術過目即能，稟性仁孝，言輙導化，國人稱聖，儒士雲集。父兇念生，厥[8]性惡重，前家[9]有冶師去城七里，欲圖殺兒，書勅冶師曰：『昔育此[10]兒，兒入吾[11]家，疾疫相仍，財耗畜死。太卜占云：「兒致此災。」書到極[12]攝，投之火中。』訛命兒曰：『吾年西夕加有重疾，爾到冶師所諦計錢寶，是爾終年之財。』兒受命行，於城門內，覩弟與輩彈胡[13]桃戲，弟曰：『兄來吾之幸矣，為吾復折。』兄曰：『父命當行。』弟曰：『吾請行矣。』奪書之冶師所。冶師承書，投弟于火。父心[14]忪忪而怖，遣使索兒，使覩兄曰：『弟如之乎？』兄如狀對。兄歸陳之，父驛馬追兒已為灰矣。「父投躬呼天結氣內塞，遂成[15]癈疾。又生毒念曰：『吾無嗣已，不[16]以斯子為？必欲殺之。』父有邸閣去國千里，仍遣斯兒曰：『彼散吾財，爾往計校。今與邸閣書，囊藏蠟封，爾急以行。』書陰勅曰：『此兒到，[17]急以石縛腰沈之深淵。』兒受命稽首，輕騎[18]進半。道有梵志，與父遙相被服，常相問遺書[19]數往來。梵志有女，女既賢明，深知吉凶天文占候，兒行到梵志所居曰：『吾父所親梵志正在斯止。』謂從者曰：『今欲過修禮之，可乎？』從者曰：『善！』即過覲禮。梵志喜曰：『吾兄子來。』便命四隣學士儒生耆德雲集，娛宴歡樂，并[20]諮眾疑靡不欣懌，終日極夜各疲眠寐。女竊[21]覩男，見其腰帶佩囊封之書，默解取還，省讀其辭，悵然而歎曰：『斯何妖厲，賊害仁子乃至斯乎？』裂書更之，其辭曰：『吾年西垂，重疾日困，彼梵志吾之親友也，厥女既賢且明，[22]古今任為兒匹，極[23]具寶帛娉禮[24]務好小禮大娉，納妻之日，案斯勅矣。』為書畢，[25]開關復之。「明晨進路，梵志眾儒靡不尋歎。邸閣得書，承命具禮詣梵志家。梵志夫妻議曰：『夫婚姻之儀，始之於擇行問[26]咎占兆，彼善禮[A3]備即吾許焉。今現男不媒禮娉便臻，[27]彼豈將慢乎？』又退[28]讌息曰：『男女為偶，自古然矣。男賢女貞，誠亦難值。』遂納禮會宗，九族歎曰：『斯榮傳世。』納妻禮成，邸閣馳啟，四姓聞之結疾殊篤。兒聞親疾，哽[29]咽而言：『[30]夫命難保，猶幻非真。』梵志欲擇良日遣還，菩薩內痛不從其[31]云，[32]室家馳歸[33]升堂稽首，妻尋再拜，垂泣而進三步又拜，稱名曰『妾是子男某妻，親[34]召妾為某，當奉宗嗣箕箒之使，盡禮修孝。惟願大人疾瘳福臻，永保無終之壽，令其展[35]情獲孝婦之德。』四姓結忿內塞而殞。菩薩殯送慈惻[36]哀慕，一國稱孝，喪畢修行[37]馨熏十方。」佛告諸比丘：「童子者，吾身是也。妻者，[38]俱夷[39]是。四姓者，調達[＊]是。菩薩法忍度無極行忍辱如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 25c08-26c5)[25] 褻【大】＊，㲲【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[26] 街【大】，衢【元】【明】　[27] 道【大】，首【宋】【元】【明】　[28] 覩【大】，觀【宋】【元】【明】　[29] 于【大】，乎【宋】【元】【明】　[30] 者【大】，者之【宋】【元】【明】　[31] 粳【大】，粇【宋】【元】【明】　[32] 生【大】，無【宋】【元】【明】　[33] 子【大】，兒【宋】【元】【明】　[34] 身【大】，娠【宋】【元】【明】　[35] 姓【大】，族【宋】【元】【明】　[36] 以【大】，用【元】【明】　[＊25-1] 褻【大】＊，㲲【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[37] 汫【大】，井【宋】，坑【元】【明】　[38] 於【大】，于【宋】【元】【明】　[39] 知【大】，之【明】　[40] 誥【大】，詰【宋】【元】【明】　[41] 湩【大】＊，潼【明】＊　[42] 復【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[＊25-2] 褻【大】＊，㲲【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[1] 亭【大】，停【宋】【元】【明】　[2] 褻【大】，㲲【宋】【元】【明】　[3] 棄【大】，辜【宋】【元】，姑【明】　[4] 墮【大】，隨【元】　[5] 擔【大】，誓【宋】【元】【明】　[6] 有【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[7] 人行【大】，行人【宋】，人【元】【明】　[8] 性【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 有【大】，以【宋】【元】【明】　[10] 兒兒【大】，子子【宋】【元】【明】　[11] 家【大】，門【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 攝【大】，懾【宋】【元】【明】　[13] 桃【大】，跳【宋】，掉【元】【明】　[14] 忪忪【大】，憧憧【宋】　[15] 癈【大】，發【宋】　[16] 以【大】，用【元】【明】　[17] 急【大】，疾【宋】【元】【明】　[18] 進【大】，進路進路【宋】【元】【明】　[19] 數【大】，疏【宋】【元】【明】　[20] 諮【大】，咨【宋】【元】【明】　[21] 覩【大】，觀【宋】【元】【明】　[22] 古【大】，可【宋】【元】【明】　[23] 具【大】，其【宋】【元】【明】　[24] 務【大】，豫【元】【明】　[25] 開【大】，間【宋】【元】【明】　[26] 咎【大】，名【宋】【元】【明】　[A3] 備【CB】【麗-CB】，𢞎【大】(cf.

They wrapped him up in rags and, during the night, when no one was around silently left him at a crossroads along with a thousand pieces of cash to send him on his way. This day was regarded as auspicious according to the custom of this kingdom and everyone gathered for a celebration in the countryside, nobles and commoners eating and enjoying themselves with members of their own kind. A brahmin observed the festivities and praised the revellers, saying, “Oh! All you celebrating today! Like glutinous rice, white and unmixed, your fragrance is wonderful! If today produces any boy or girl children they will be valued and worthy.”
Among those seated was a rich man, who was childless so without an heir, and when he heard this he silently rejoiced and sent someone to ask around and find out whether there had been any children abandoned. The servant asked passers-by saying, “Have you seen any abandoned children about?”
One of them said, “There was one, but a childless woman took it.”
The servant searched for her and discovered where she lived. He said, “I am here on behalf a noble family, rich, but without an heir. If you give them the child you will be rewarded handsomely.”
The woman said, “You can leave some money, take the child, and give me whatever it is I want.”
The woman got her way. The rich man looked after the child for several months and then his wife became pregnant. He said to himself, “The only reason I was raising a child of another family was because I had no heir of my own. Heaven has bestowed on me this great blessing - now what am I going to do with him?”
He wrapped the child in rags and at night he placed him in a pit, but the family’s goats came every day and fed him. The herder went to investigate and saw the child and, sighing, said,
“Why has the High Lord [1] put this child here?”
He took the child home and looked after him, giving him goat’s milk to drink. The rich man found out and demanded, “Why are you stealing my milk?”
He replied, “I received an orphan from Heaven and I am using the milk to feed him.”
The rich man was full of regret and remorse so took the child in and cared for him for a few months. But when his wife gave birth to a son, evil thoughts arose once again, and he did as he had before and wrapped him in rags and placed him in a wagon rut. But the child kept in mind the Buddha’s Three Treasures and remained compassionate towards his parent. In the morning a merchant with several hundred cartloads of goods came along this road. One of his oxen stumbled and would not go forward. The merchant went to find out why and he saw the child, and startled he cried, “A son of the Heavenly Lord! How did he get here?”
Carrying the child in his arms he put him into the cart and the oxen went forward like water flowing. Having gone several miles, he rested the oxen by the side of a pavilion. There was a childless old woman who begged the merchant, “Favour me with the child and save this old woman from destitution.”
He promptly did so. The woman cared for him, but before long the rich man had come to heard of this and feeling grieved said, “My lack of humaneness will destroy my heavenly virtue!”
So once again he offered treasures asking that the child be permitted to return home and, choking with sobs, he reproached himself and treated the two infants just the same. After several years it became apparent that the child’s intelligence was highly unusual in its reach and, evil thoughts revived; “He is bright beyond all measure, and my son is certainly not! I must carry him off.”
He bundled the child up and took him into the mountains where he abandoned him among some bamboo assuming that without food he would certainly perish. But the child thought compassionate thoughts and said, “When later I achieve buddhahood, I will certainly save beings from suffering.”
This mountain had a nearby stream and the child used his own strength to wriggle through the bamboo to the lower ground, where he rolled down to the bank of the stream. Some few miles downstream there was a village of pallbearers. One of the villagers was out collecting firewood. He saw the small child in the distance and went to have a look, and exclaimed, “The High Lord has sent down this child!”
Cradling the child, he took him home to look after him.
Once again, the rich man heard the news and felt remorse as he had before. Offering many precious things, he begged the child might return with him as he shed tears of grief. He instructed him in works of literature and mathematics and to read the portents in the heavens above and on the earth below. This child needed only to be shown something once before he was able to master all manner of arts. By nature, he was kind and filial, all he had to do was speak and people changed their ways. The people of the kingdom called him a sage and people of learning [2] gathered in clouds around him. Murderous thoughts arose in his father again, and his wickedness intensified. Previously his household had included a blacksmith who was based a few miles outside town. He formulated a plan to kill the child and wrote a letter with instructions for the blacksmith: “In the past I raised this child, but after he entered my home illness followed illness, my wealth was depleted, and my livestock died. The Grand Diviner [3] made a prognostication and informed me that this child had caused these disasters. When you have read this letter grab him and throw him in the furnace.”
Then under false pretences he ordered the child saying, “I am getting on in years and I have a serious illness. Go to the blacksmiths and make a careful inventory of the money and treasures he keeps there and this will be yours for the rest of your life.”
The child accepted his order and set off. Within the city gates he saw his younger brother and his contemporaries playing with walnuts. His younger brother said, “It’s lucky for me you came along, you can help me recoup my losses.” [4]
The elder said, “Father has given me an order and I ought to carry it out.”
The younger said, “Let me do it.”
He took the letter to the blacksmith. The blacksmith received the letter and threw the younger brother onto the furnace. Their father felt alarmed and frightened and sent someone to search for his son. The messenger said, “Where is your younger brother?”
The elder brother told him what had happened and then returned and explained to his father. His father sped off on horseback after his child, but he had already been reduced to ash. The father threw himself down and cried out to Heaven. His life-force became constricted and formed a blockage inside him resulting in an incurable illness. Once again poisonous thoughts came forth and he said, “I have no heir now, and I’m not going to let this child become such. I must see him dead.”
The father had a warehouse a few hundred miles away from his own kingdom so he sent this child there saying, “They are squandering my money. You go and assess the situation. Now in this bag sealed with wax I have put a letter for you to take to the warehouse. Now get yourself swiftly on your way.”
The letter contained secret orders which said, “When this child arrives, quickly tie a stone around his waist and plunge him into some deep water.”
The child received his instructions, touched his head to the ground to show his respects, then set off on his horse. Halfway along his route there lived a brahmin, a trusted friend of his father, and from afar the pair frequently exchanged gifts and many letters went back and forth.
The brahmin had a daughter who was worthy and clever with a deep knowledge of portents and could prognosticate though observation of the movements of heavenly bodies. When the child arrived at the place where the brahmin lived he said, “That brahmin friend of my father’s lives right here!”
He said to his attendant, “I would like to stop by and pay my respects to him, may I do so?”
The attendant answered, “Very good.”
Straight away he went to pay his respects. The brahmin was delighted and announced, “My elder brother’s son has arrived!”
Then he ordered his neighbours on all sides to come and scholars and the learned arrived in droves. He amused them with a banquet and they all enjoyed themselves, asking all kinds of questions of the young man. Everyone had a wonderful time. At the end of the day, late at night, everyone was exhausted and went to bed. The girl stole in to take a look at the young man and saw the letter in the sealed pouch hanging from his girdle. She silently untied it and took it back with her to her own quarters. She read the contents of the letter and upset she sighed and said, “What kind of monster would go to these lengths to kill his humane son?”
She tore the letter up and replaced it with one which said:
I am in my twilight years, suffering from a serious illness which worsens daily. That brahmin is my dear friend and his daughter is worthy and, moreover, very clever; never has there been a woman who would make such a fine match for my child. Prepare the greatest quantity of treasures and silks and dispatch someone to present them as betrothal gifts; ensure that all the correct offerings are made and the betrothal is finalised. Arrange a marriage date in accordance with these instructions.
When she had finished writing this letter, she put it back and resealed the bag. The following morning the young man resumed his journey and everyone, the brahmin and his scholar friends, were sad to see him go. When the steward of the warehouse received the letter, he followed the instructions and with all due ceremony visited the home of the brahmin. The brahmin and his wife discussed the proposal, saying, “These wedding arrangements have begun with a violation of the proper procedure of ‘enquiring about names’ [5] and prognosticating on the omens. Only when the correct rituals have been completed should we give our consent.  Now this man has not engaged a matchmaker to attend to the rituals of betrothal and has approached us direct, does this not show contempt?”
But on retiring to rest they reconsidered, “Since time began men and women have got together like this. It is really hard for a worthy boy and a chaste girl to meet.” [6]
So they accepted the betrothal gifts and summoned members of their clan, and all their relations exclaimed, “This honour will be passed down through the generations!”
Once the marriage ceremonies had been completed the steward of the warehouse hastened to inform his master that his wishes had been met. When the rich man heard what had happened his illness took a more serious turn. When the son heard of his relatives’ illness he said, choking with sobs, “Life is so difficult to protect! It is like an illusion— unreal!”
The brahmin wanted to fix an auspicious day for his return home, but the Bodhisattva was experiencing such inner anguish that he did not follow his advice and together with his wife, rushed home. On entering his father’s room, he touched his head to the floor in respect. His wife came after him and bowed twice and with tears flowing advanced three steps and bowed again. She announced her name and said, “I am your son’s lowly wife, my parents named me such-and-such. I will serve your heir performing all the household duties a wife should. I will comply with the rites to the utmost and practice filial piety. All I desire is that you, Sir, recover swiftly, that good fortune follows, and that you gain eternal protection and unending longevity, allowing me to put my feelings for you into practice and acquire the virtue of a filial wife.”
The rich man’s pent-up fury caused a blockage in his innards and he expired. The Bodhisattva had him encoffined and buried with kindness and compassion. Heartbroken, he cherished the memory of his departed father. The entire kingdom praised him as filial, and by the conclusion of the funeral ceremonies his conduct perfumed the Ten Directions.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“The young man was me. The wife was Yaśodharā (Juyi 俱夷). The rich man was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”
  The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.

It involves enquiring into the names and the date and time of the birth of the potential bride so the couple can be assessed for compatibility.

News of this reverberated far and wide and none did not sing his praises. His uncle was also a ruler of a different kingdom. By nature greedy and shameless, wickedness was his forte. Those close to the Enlightened One sighed, “The Bodhisattva embraces the humane kindness of the Two Powers [2].”
His uncle fabricated some slander, blaming him for a particular incident, and raised an army with the intention of taking the Bodhisattva’s kingdom by force. All the Bodhisattva’s officials said, “Better reviled by a one of divine humaneness than valued by a vicious tyrant.”
His people said, “Better the beast of a moral master than a man under a monster.”
Warriors were selected and the army readied. The ruler of the kingdom ascended to a platform and looked over the troops full of emotion. He wept, tears streaming down his neck. He thought to himself, “These peoples’ lives will be destroyed because of me, one person— the kingdom will be ruined and it will be difficult to restore. Human life is difficult to attain, were I to flee to a distant place all within the kingdom’s borders will remain peaceful, who then would experience any misfortune?”
The King and his principal queen relinquished their power and fled. The uncle entered and occupied the kingdom and governed with greed and brutality, treating the loyal and honourable with contempt and advancing the cunning and toxic. He governed with cruelty and the people were hard-pressed. Bitter tears fell continuously, and they expressed their feelings for their old sovereign in song, missing him as filial son would keep in mind his loving parents. The King and his principal wife lived in the mountain forests, but the oceans contained an evil dragon who was attracted by the consort’s luminous countenance. He transformed himself into a brahmin and disingenuously sat before them his hands clasped, his legs stretched out, his head hanging as if peacefully in thought, just as an ascetic does when deep in dhyāna concentration. The King saw him and was delighted and each day gathered fruit to offer to him. The dragon kept a close watch on the King’s movements and stole in and left with the consort under his arm, intending to return to his ocean home. His route had mountains on either side and passed through a narrow defile. In the mountains there lived an enormous bird who spread out his wings to block the dragon’s route and attempted to fight him. But the dragon hit the bird with a thunderclap; the bird’s right wing dropped and the dragon took his prisoner back to the ocean. The King returned from gathering fruit and could not find his consort. Upset, he asked, “What wayward behaviour in a past life has brought me such misfortune?”
Then he took up his bow and grasped his arrows went through the mountains searching for her. He saw a stream and went to look for its source. He came across an enormous monkey who seemed to be in great distress. The King sadly said to the monkey, “You are also grieving. What’s the matter?”
The monkey said, “My maternal uncle and I jointly shouldered the responsibilities of rulership but using his powerful influence he wrested my followers from me. Alas, there is no one to whom I can report this. What fate brought you to these rocky hills?”
The Bodhisattva answered, “Our sorrows are on a par, you and I! I have lost my consort and do not know where she has gone.”
The monkey replied, “If you help me fight for the return of my people, we will help you search for her and we will certainly find her in the end.”
The King agreed to this, saying, “Very well.”
The next day the monkey went in to battle with his uncle and the King drew back his bow and took up an arrow. As he was exerting all the power in his limbs to draw back his bow the uncle felt fear from afar and hesitated, before turning swiftly to flee. The monkey king’s peoples returned and he ordered them saying, “The principal consort of this human king is lost somewhere in these mountains, spread out all of you and search for her.”
The group of moneys each set off on their way and some came across the bird with the injured wing. The bird asked, “Who are you looking for?”
They replied, “The human king has lost his principal consort and we are looking for her.”
The bird said, “A dragon has stolen her! My strength was unequal to his and now he has her on a big island in the middle of the ocean.”
When he had finished talking the bird expired. The monkey king led his people along the route to the seaboard but he was troubled by his lack of any way to cross to the island. The King of the Gods Śakra (Tiandi Shi天帝釋) transformed into a mangy monkey and came forward and said, “There are so many of you—more than grains of sand in the sea! Why fret about not being able to reach that island? If each of us keeps carrying stones and piling them up we could block the sea with with a huge mountain. Couldn’t we construct a causeway to the island?”
The monkey king appointed him overseer and the rest went along with his scheme, shouldering rocks as they laboured to bring it to fruition. They crossed the sea and surrounded the island with row upon row of monkeys. The dragon produced a poisonous miasma which made all the monkeys fall to the ground ill. The two monarchs were despondent and anxious when a small monkey spoke with gravitas, “I will cure the monkeys’ sickness, don’t trouble your sagely thoughts!”
He smeared a heavenly medicine in their snouts and they all raised their heads and arose, more vigorous than before. The dragon then caused winds to rise up and cover the sun with clouds. Flashes of lightening lit up the sky and furious thunderclaps shook the heavens and moved the earth. The small monkey said, “You, human king, are a marvellous archer; it is the dragon who is producing the lightning. Release an arrow to elimanate this scourge and bring good fortune to the people, the sages will not complain!”
When the lightning flashed the king released his arrow which struck the dragon square in his chest, killing him. The monkey hoards declared their joy and the small monkey pulled out the bolt of the dragon’s gate, opened it and brought out the consort. Heavenly beings and spirits were all delighted. The two kings returned to the mountain where they expressed gratitude to one another, both self-effacingly exalted and deferred to the other.
As chance would have it the uncle of the human king had died without an heir. The officials and people rushed around searching for their old ruler and in that remote mountainous area, ruler and subject came face to face and tears flowed.  They returned home together and he took over his uncle’s rule. The common folk were full of joy and wished him a long life of ten thousand years. He issued a general amnesty and governed without harshness; the people were happy and went about their business smiling.
The King said to his consort, “When a wife stays just one night apart from her husband the multitudes will have their suspicions, how much more will their suspicions be raised when the period is one of weeks? You must return to your ancestral home in accordance with the ancient custom.”
His consort replied, “Although I was in the burrow of that foul reptilian creature, I remained like the lotus rooted in the mire. If my word can be trusted let the ground split open!”
When she had finish speaking the ground fractured and she declared, “My veracity is witnessed!”
The King said, “Excellent! This type of pure and chaste behaviour would be worthy of a śramaṇa!”
From then on, the kingdom followed the King’s transformative example, which caused merchants to waive their profit, scholars to relinquish their office, the powerful to exercise forbearance with the lowly, and the strong to refrain from humiliating the weak; and following the primary consort’s example lascivious women changed their ways, and even endangered their lives to protect their chastity.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“At this time the King was me; my consort was Yaśodharā (Juyi 俱夷). The Heavenly Lord was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒).”
  The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.
  Notes:
[1] The Four Equalities (si deng 四等) or Four Equal States of Mind (si deng xin 四等心) are the apramānas, four states of mind a Buddha manifests to all, later translated as the Four Immeasurable States of Mind (si wuliang xin 四無量心). They are loving-kindness (maitrī; ci 慈), compassion (karuṇā; bei 悲), sympathetic joy (muditā; xi 喜), and equanimity (upekṣā; she 捨).

He constantly practiced kindness towards all and came to the aid of any living being in distress. He lived deep in the mountains and had climbed a tree to gather fruit when he saw, in a mountain ravine, an exhausted man who had fallen in and was unable to get himself out. His piteous wailing had been going on for a few days as he beseeched Heaven begging for his life to be saved. The monkey heard his wailing and was moved to tears. He said, “My vow to seek Buddhahood was just because of this kind of incident. Now if do not to help this man get out of the ravine, he will inevitably die. I will find a way down cliff face and carry him out on my back.”
So, he entered the deep valley, and carrying him on his own back, clambered through the vegetation as he ascended the mountain and placed him on level ground. He showed him the path and said, “Wherever you go after we part, take care not to do evil.”
Having extracted the man, the monkey was extremely fatigued so he took a break and lay down to rest. The man said to himself, “In that ravine I was starving with nothing edible to hand. Now I am out it’s just the same, how is my situation any different?”
He thought to himself, “I’m going to kill the monkey, eat him, and so save myself. Surely that’s permissible?”
He battered the monkeys head with a stone and blood flowed staining the ground red. The monkey leapt up from his prone position but dizzy, he fell from the tree he had climbed.  Devoid of anger and so kind, he was grieved, just sad that this man had embraced evil, and thought to himself, “My powers were not able to save this man! I hope that in future eras he frequently encounters buddhas and trustingly accepts their teachings on the Way and practicing them gains salvation so that in successive eras he never again entertains evil thoughts such as this man did.”
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“The monkey was me and the man in the ravine was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”
  The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this."

The first dragon said, “There is nothing in the oceans that you and I have not seen. Why not go ashore together for a bit of fun?”
The other replied, “On land men are wicked. If we go ashore we might encounter some unusual situation – we cannot go out!”
The first dragon pressed the point, “We can transform ourselves into small snakes. If there is no one about we can disport ourselves in the thoroughfares; if we bump into someone, then we can hide. What are you worried about?”
So, he agreed and they both climbed ashore to have a look around.  Not long out of the water they encountered a venomous viper in their path. The viper noticed the pair and conceived a murderous thought; he resolved to attack them and spewed venomous saliva at the two snakes. The first snake was all for killing the poisonous viper with his awesome divine powers; the other snake had a compassionate heart and with forbearance pleaded with him not to, saying, “One of high morality ought to absolve the ignorant masses of responsibility for their misguided actions and bear the unbearable. This is the great rule of the Buddha’s Truth.”
Then he spoke this verse:
  Whom greed has crazed,
Has no humane and righteous heart.
And in their envy want to harm the sage;
Only those who practice silent forbearance are at peace.
  The lawless who infringe the rules,
Have no compassion within,
And their miserly wickedness inhibits giving;
Only those who practice silent forbearance are at peace.
  The unrestrained, who follow no rules,
Cruelly harm and embrace the wicked,
And refuse to comply with morality;
Only those who practice silent forbearance are at peace.
  He who turns his back with no understanding of empathy,
In their empty boasts, toady and deceive,
And theirs is the ultimate ignorance;
Only those who practice silent forbearance are at peace.
  So did one snake extol the virtue of forbearance and used verse to explain his reasoning, while the other respectfully accepted what he said and did not harm the viper.
One of the snakes said, “Shall we return to the ocean?”
And they both agreed to leave. Aroused by their awesome divine power the Heavens and the Earth shook, clouds rose, and rain fell as they transformed into Sun Dragons [1]. Men and ghosts were all startled, and the viper was petrified. Like a corpse he stared uncomprehendingly into the distance and did not eat for seven days.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“At that time the dragon who wanted to harm the viper was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難), and the one who explicated the way to practice forbearance was me. The venomous viper was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”
  The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.

[1] Longyao 龍耀 might be translated as ‘dragon brilliance’, but I suspect this stands for the Torch Dragon (zhulong 燭龍) as seen in pre-Buddhist texts – this dragon’s gaze is reportedly as bright as the sun."
"《六度集經》卷5：「（四九）「[1]昔者有國名摩天羅，王名難，學通神明，靡幽不覩，覺世非常，曰：『吾身當朽為世糞壤，何[2]國之可保？』捐榮棄樂，服大士之法服，一鉢食為足，稟沙門戒，山林為居積三十年。樹邊有坑，坑深三十丈。時，有獵者，馳騁尋鹿墮于坑中。時，有鳥、蛇各一，亦驚俱隕焉，體皆毀傷，俱亦困矣。仰天悲[3]號，有孤窮之音。道士愴然，火照見之，涕[4]泣交頸，臨坑告曰：『汝等無憂，[5]吾拔汝重難。』即作長繩懸以登之，三物或銜或持，遂獲全命。俱叩頭謝曰：『吾等命在轉[6]燭，道士仁惠弘普無量，令吾等得覩天日。願終斯身給眾所乏，以微報重，萬不[7]賽一。』「道士曰：『吾為國王，國大民多，宮寶婇女諸國為上，願即響應何求不得？吾以國為怨窟，以色聲香味華服邪念，為六劒截吾身，六箭射吾體，由斯六邪輪轉受苦，三塗酷烈難忍難堪，吾甚厭[8]之。捐國為沙門，願獲如來、無所著、正真道、最正覺、道法御、天人師，開化群生令[9]還本[10]元，豈但汝等三人而已乎？各還舊居見汝所親，令三自歸無違佛教矣。』「獵者曰：『處世有年，雖覩儒士積德為善，豈有若佛弟子恕己濟眾，隱處而不揚名者乎？若道士有之，願至吾家乞微供養。』烏曰：『吾名鉢，道士有難，願呼吾名，吾當馳詣。』蛇曰：『吾名[11]萇，若道士有患，願呼吾名，必來報恩。』辭畢各退。「他日，道士之獵者舍，獵者遙[12]見其來，告妻曰：『彼不祥之人來，吾勅汝為饌。』徐[13]徐設之，彼過日中即不食矣。妻覩道士勃然作色，訛留設食，虛談過中。道士退矣，還山覩烏，呼名曰：『鉢。』烏問曰：『自何來耶？』曰：『獵者所來。』烏曰：『已食乎？』曰：『彼設未辦而日過中，時不應食故吾退耳。』烏曰：『凶咎之[14]鬼難以慈濟，違仁背恩，凶逆之大[15]也。吾無飲食，無以供養。留心坐斯，吾須臾還。』飛之般遮國，入王後宮，覩王夫人臥，首飾之中有明月珠。烏銜馳還，以奉道士。「夫人[16]寐寤，求之不獲，即以上聞。王勅臣民：『有得之者，賞金銀各千斤，牛馬各千首；得不貢者，罪重滅宗。』道士惠獵者，獵者縛而白之。王曰：『汝從[17]何得斯寶乎？』道士深惟：『以狀言之，即一國烏皆死矣；云[18]盜得之，斯非佛弟子也。』默然受拷，杖楚千數，不怨王，不讎彼，弘慈誓曰：『令吾得佛，度眾[19]生諸苦矣。』「王曰：『取道士埋之，[＊]唯出其頭，明日戮焉。』道士乃呼蛇曰：『[＊]萇。』蛇曰：『天下無知我名者，[＊]唯有道士耳。揚聲相呼，必有以也。』疾邁，見道士若茲，叩頭問曰：『何由致此？』道士具[20]陳厥所由然。蛇流淚曰：『道士仁如天地，尚與禍會，豈況無道，誰將祐之乎？天仁無怨，斯王[＊]唯有太子一人，無他儲副，我將入宮[21]咋殺太子，以吾神藥[A6]傅之即[22]愈。』蛇夜入宮，咋之即絕。停屍三日，令曰：『有能活太子者，分國而治。』載之山間，當[23]火葬之。行[24]徑歷道士邊，道士曰：『太子何疾而致[25]喪身乎？且無葬矣！吾能活之。』從者聞說，馳以上聞。王心悲喜，重更哀慟曰：『吾赦爾罪，分國為王。』道士以藥[A7]傅身，太子忽然興曰：『吾何緣在斯乎？』從者具陳所以。太子還[26]宮，巨細喜舞。「分國惠之，一無所受。王[27]寤曰：『分國不受，豈當盜哉？』問：『子何國人？以何見為沙門乎？何從獲珠？行高乃然，忽[28]罹斯患，將以何由？』道士本末陳焉，王為愴然[29]泣淚流面。王告獵者曰：『子有功勳於國，悉呼九親來，吾欲重賜之。』親無巨細皆詣宮門，王曰：『不仁背恩，惡之元首。』盡殺之矣。道士入山學道，精進不[30]惓，命終生天上。」佛告諸比丘：「時道士者，吾身是也。烏者，鶖鷺子是[31]也。蛇者，阿難是，獵者。調達是。其妻者，懷[32]槃女子是也。菩薩弘仁度無極行忍辱如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, p. 28a1-c14)[1] 昔【大】，昔字上有（摩天羅王經）五字經題【宋】【元】【明】　[2] 國【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[3] 號【大】，嘷【宋】【元】【明】　[4] 泣【大】，泗【宋】【元】【明】　[5] 吾【大】，吾將【宋】【元】【明】　[6] 燭【大】，矚【元】【明】　[7] 賽【大】，塞【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 之【大】，之故【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 還【大】，逮【宋】【元】【明】　[10] 元【大】，無【宋】【元】【明】　[11] 萇【大】＊，長【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[12] 見【大】，覩【宋】【元】【明】　[13] 徐【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[14] 鬼【大】，魅【宋】【元】【明】　[15] 也【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 寐寤【CB】【麗-CB】【宋】【元】【明】，寤寐【大】(cf.

Through study he had achieved a spiritual clarity which could eliminate any darkness. Aware that the world was impermanent, he said, “My body will decay and become manure for later generations; how could I ever protect a kingdom?”
He cast aside the glories of the secular world, relinquished its joys, and donned the dharma robes of the great man; an alms-bowlful of food became sufficient and having accepted the śramaṇas’ rules he made the mountain forests his home for thirty years. By the side of his tree there was a pit some three hundred feet deep. One day a hunter pursuing a deer at a gallop fell into the pit. Then a crow and a snake got such a shock they also fell in, both sustaining injuries; all were in great difficulties. They all looked up to the heavens and cried piteously. The sounds of these wretched creatures in dire straits reached the ears of the monk, who was grieved and fetched a torch to illuminate the pit. Tears streaming down his neck, he leant into the pit and called, “Don’t worry! I will pull you out of this serious difficulty!”
Then he made a long rope which he suspended for them to climb up. The three beings hauled themselves up some using their mouths, some using their hands, and their lives were saved. They all touched their heads to the ground in respect and thanked him saying, “Our lives’ flame was about to be passed on to another existence, but your kindness, monk, universal and unlimited, allowed us the opportunity to see the sun in the sky. We vow to give beings what they lack for the rest of our lives, repaying the great with the small as the ten thousand cannot compete with the one.”
The monk said, “I was the ruler of a kingdom, great and populous. The treasures of my palace and my palace women were superior to those of any other kingdom. Whatever I desired was mine as echo responds to sound, there was nothing I sought that I did not receive. But I regarded my kingdom as the lair of my enemy seeing the beautiful sights, sounds, fragrances, tastes, gorgeous clothing and immoral desires [1], like six blades stabbing my body, like six arrows piercing my form. It is because of these six evils that we are caught in the roundabout of birth-and-death and suffer. The cruelties of the Three Mires [2] are difficult to endure and difficult to bear and I came to loathe these six so I relinquished my kingdom and became a śramaṇa, vowing to attain the status of a Thus-come One, a Non-Attached, being of Supreme, Perfect Awakening, a Charioteer of the Dharma, a Teacher of Gods and Men, and to educate and convert living beings causing them to return to their original non-being [3]. How could my intentions stop with you three? Each return to your original homes and see those dear to you. Cause them to take the Threefold Refuge and not violate the Buddha’s teachings!”
The hunter said, “I’ve been around a good few years and although I have seen Confucian scholars accumulate virtue by good actions, could it be that there are those such as the Buddha’s disciples who put themselves last to save others, hiding away and not seeking fame? If you, monk, ever need anything, I want you to come to my house to ask for some small offering.”
The Crow said, “My name is Alms-Bowl. Should you ever be in difficulties, monk, please call my name and I will hasten to you.”
The snake said, “My name is Long-body [4]. Should you ever be in trouble, monk, please call my name and I will certainly come to repay your kindness.”
When they had said their goodbyes, each set off home.
One day, the monk went to the home of the hunter. The hunter saw him coming in the distance and told his wife, “That accursed fellow is on his way! I’ll order you to prepare food but go about preparing it very slowly – he won’t eat anything after noon.”
When his wife saw the monk, she coloured in agitation and went about pretending to prepare him food while chatting idly with him until noon had passed, and the monk went home. Back in the mountains he saw the crow and cried out his name, “Alms-bowl!”
The crow asked, “Where have you been?”
He replied, “I’ve come from the hunter’s place.”
The crow said, “Have you eaten?”
He replied, “The meal they were preparing was not ready by noon, and after that time I ought not to eat so I went home.”
The crow said, “That disaster of a demon is difficult to save with compassion. He who goes against humaneness and has turned his back on kindness is extremely vicious and perverse. I have nothing here to eat or drink so have nothing to offer you. Please sit, I will return in a moment.  He flew to the kingdom of Banzhi (般遮國) where he entered the quarters of the royal women. He saw the King’s wife asleep and among her hair ornaments was a bright-moon pearl [5]. The crow took it in its beak and swiftly returned home and presented it to the monk. When the woman awoke, she searched for it but failing to find it she reported to the King. He issued an edict sating: “Whoever has the pearl will be compensated with one thousand pounds of both gold and silver and one thousand head of both oxen and horses on its return; failure to hand it over is a crime of great weight and will mean the extermination of their clan.”
The monk had given it to the hunter and the hunter tied him up and informed the court. The King said, “Where did you get this jewel?”
The monk thought deeply, and said to himself, “If I explain the situation all the crows of this kingdom will perish. If I say I stole it this would suggest I had acted in a way not befitting a disciple of the Buddha.”
He remained silent, and received a beating of one thousand lashes with a thorny stick. He did not resent the King, nor feel enmity for him, he merely vowed with far reaching compassion, “Let me become a buddha and save living beings from all their suffering.”
The King said, “Take this monk and bury him so only his head protrudes, and tomorrow we will kill him.”
The monk then called on the snake, “Long-body!”
The snake said, “The only one in the world who knows my name is the monk. There must be a good reason he calls my name.”
He swiftly got going and when he saw the monk in this predicament, he bowed his head in respect and said, “How did you get here?”
The monk told him all about how he had ended up like this. The snake, weeping, said, “You, monk, have the humaneness of heaven and earth, yet you still meet with calamities such as these. How much worse will it be for those who live without the Way? Who will be able to protect them? Your divine humaneness knows no resentment. This King has only the Crown Prince able to succeed him. I will enter the palace and bite the Crown Prince, then my divine medicine can be applied and he will be cured.”
At night the snake entered the palace and bit the Crown Prince, who died. The body had been held for three days when the King issued an order announcing, “If there is anyone able to revive the Crown Prince I will split the kingdom with him and he can govern half.”
While transporting the body through the mountains on the way to be cremated the route passed by the monk and he said, “What illness caused the death of the Crown Prince? Don’t cremate him yet! I can revive him!”
The attendants heard him and rushed to report to the King. The King was both distressed and elated , and gravely and with extreme sorrow he said, “I will pardon you of your crime and divide the kingdom, making you ruler.”
The monk smeared the medicine over the body.
The Crown Prince suddenly arose and said, “What am I doing here?”
His attendants told him the whole story. The Crown Prince returned to the palace and old and young all danced for joy. A portion of the kingdom was to be given to the monk, but he would not accept any part of it. Realisation started to dawn, on the King who said, “How could you be a thief, yet not accept a portion of my kingdom?”
He asked, “Where are you from? What experiences made you become a śramaṇa? Where did you get the pearl? With such high standards of behaviour how did you suddenly encounter such misfortune?”
The monk told his story from start to finish and the king was grieved and tears flowed down his face.
The King told the hunter, “You have performed some meritorious service to the kingdom! Call you all your relations here I wish to reward them handsomely.”
His relatives, young and old, all came to the gates of the palace. The King said, “Those who are inhumane and have turned their backs on kindness commit the worst evil of all!”
So saying, he had them all put to death.
The monk went into the mountains to study the Way, which he did with untiring dedication and at the end of his life he was born in the Heavens.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
 “At that time the monk was me. The crow was Śāriputra (Quiluzi 鶖鷺子), the snake Ānanda (A’nan 阿難). The hunter was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達) and his wife was the woman Huaipan (懷槃 “Embrace-a-basin”).”
  The Bodhisattva’s vast, humane, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.

His realm was vast and his people were flourishing. He governed with rectitude and never treated the populace unjustly. The King had two children, a son and a daughter. The son was called Xuda (須達) and the daughter Andu’nan (安闍難). They maintained high standards of purity in their conduct and the King valued them highly. He made them a golden pool and the two children went in to bathe. In the pool lived a turtle, whose name was Golden (Jin 金). He was blind in one eye and was also playing in the water when he bumped into the two children who took fright and cried out loudly. The King asked what was wrong and they said, “There’s something in the pool that bumped into us and gave us a fright.”
The King demanded furiously, “That pool was made for my children. What is living in there with them?”
He ordered someone to catch the turtle in a fishing net. Demons and dragons thought this situation strange,  quickly facilitated his capture, and a fisherman netted it. The King asked, “How should it be dispatched?”
Some officials suggested chopping off its head, others roasting it alive or mincing it and using it to make a soup. One official said, “These deaths are just not cruel enough!  Throw him into the ocean – now that is really cruel!”
The turtle smiled to himself and cried, “Indeed, only that would be really cruel!”
The King ordered he be thrown into the river. So the turtle escaped and delighted, he rushed to visit the king of the dragons and related what had happened. He said, “The human king Yijiada has a daughter who is morally upright and of luminous beauty, the match of any heavenly maiden. The human king thinks of your Great Majesty with great affection and would like to increase his social cachet [1] by having you become kin by taking his daughter in marriage.”
The dragon asked, “Are you serious?”
The turtle replied, “Most certainly!”
A sumptuous feast was laid out for the turtle all served in bejewelled vessels. The turtle said, “Send some able officials to make enquiries at your earliest convenience. My ruler is keen to get this matter settled.”
The dragon king dispatched sixteen able officials and followed the turtle to the moat at the foot of the human king’s city wall. The turtle said, “You wait here! I will go and inform His Majesty of your arrival.”
The turtle fled never to return. The sixteen officials were somewhat dejected at this turn of events but entered the city for an audience with the King. The King asked, “What are you dragons here for?”
They replied, “Your Heavenly Majesty has kindly received us. Your Majesty was desirous of having our King take your esteemed daughter as his wife, and it is for this reason he dispatched us to meet with you.”
The King, furious, said, “You imagine a human king would take a snake or dragon for a spouse?”
The dragons replied, “But your Great Majesty sent the divine turtle to relay your wishes; we did not undertake the journey on a whim!”
The King would not countenance it. The dragons transformed and, illumining all the beings in the palace, surrounded the King. The King was frightened and cried out. All the officials were stupefied with shock and they all went to His Majesty to enquire what was going on. The King explained and the officials all asked, “Because of one girl you would imperil the kingdom?”
The King and his officials went to the shore to send the girl off to the home of her new husband. She soon became the dragon’s wife and before long gave birth to two children, a boy and a girl. The boy was named Panda (槃達) and when the dragon king died, he ascended the throne as his successor. He wished to relinquish the filth attendant on the glories of this world and to study high moral conduct was his ambition. But he had myriad wives who would all seek him out; he tried to hide in secluded places, but he could not shake them off. He came ashore and beneath a secluded pear tree he secretly changed his form into that of a snake and curled up to sleep. Night fell, yet was it was as bright as if there were dozens of brands burning beneath the tree. Day after day it rained down blossoms of dazzling colours and wonderful fragrance such as never before seen in this world. Now in this kingdom there was a person who was able to control dragons called Beitu (陂圖). He went into the mountains to search for a dragon to use in his act as he travelled round begging. He saw a young cowherd and asked him if he knew of any. The boy relied, “I saw a snake curled up asleep beneath that tree. At night there are dozens of torches burning on the tree, and bright and splendid flowers fall like snow, their dazzling colours and wonderful fragrance are difficult to describe. I got right up close to him, and he’s harmless.”
The dragon-charmer said, “Excellent! I have what I want!”
Then he smeared poison on the dragon’s teeth and his teeth all fell out. He beat him with a cudgel and he suffered cuts and broken bones. The dragon-charmer then scraped him from head to tail and he suffered immeasurable agonies, yet he was not resentful in the least. In fact, he reproached himself for his lack of purity [2] in previous lives, such that had brought this misfortune down on him and vowed saying, “I will achieve buddhahood and save living beings causing them to live in peace so none will suffer like I do now.”
The dragon-charmer took the snake and placed him in a small chest and set off with it on his shoulder intending to use the dragon in his begging routine. Every time they arrived in a kingdom, he would always make the dragon do a dance terrifying all the kingdom’s officials and common folk. The charmer said, “I beg of you one thousand pounds of both gold and silver, one thousand of both male and female slaves, and several thousand each of elephants, horses, oxen and carts, and domestic animals.”
In every kingdom to which he went, that is exactly what he got. Eventually he turned up in the kingdom of the dragon king’s grandfather. His mother and his dragon brethren had all come to the mainland to look for him and they had turned into birds and had settled on the royal palace. When the dragon-charmer arrived the dragon king transformed into a dragon with five heads and just when he was about to come out to dance he caught sight of his mother and brother and sister and felt so ashamed he went back into his box and refused to come out and perform. The charmer called him five or six times, but the dragon kept his head down. His mother took human form once again and went to have an audience with the King and explained the situation from start to finish. The King and his officials and people were all deeply grieved and the ruler wanted to execute the charmer, but the dragon pleaded with him saying, “I must have committed a serious offence in my past lives and now it is fitting I reap the punishment. It is not appropriate to kill him, it will only increase later sorrow. Give him whatever he wants – through spreading kindness like this one can achieve the Buddha’s Way.”
So, the King followed the example of those other kingdoms and gave him all that he wanted.
Having obtained a huge quantity of treasure, the charmer happily left the kingdom and in the next kingdom encountered bandits. His body was beaten to a pulp and his valuables scattered.
The dragon and his mother bade farewell to the King and said, “Should your Great Majesty think of us and call our names and we will come—let nothing cause you any grief!”
The King and his officials and people came to the beach to see them off and the entire kingdom was filled with sorrow at their departure, none did not beat their breast and stamp their feet.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
 “Panda the Dragon King was me. The King Yijiada was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難). The Mother was my mother and my brother was Śāriputra (Quiluzi 鶖鷺子). The younger sister was the nun Blue Lotus (Qinglianhua 青蓮華, Utpalavarṇā). At that time the man who was cruel to dragons was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).
  The Bodhisattva’s vast, compassionate, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.

With a compassionate heart surpassing even that of a loving mother he sought to saving beings. He grieved for their difficulties to the same extent as one separated from their parents grieves, and when he saw the masses accepting the Way he rejoiced as one visiting his parents after a long separation. He cherished living beings just as he would protect himself from harm.
He encountered a tiger who while devouring some animal had a bone lodge upright between his teeth. Such was the seriousness of the illness this caused he was approaching death. The sparrow saw this and was sorely grieved. He said, “The buddhas regard eating meat as a wrong, the karmic effects of which we see here!”
He entered the tiger’s mouth and pecked away at the bone day after day. An abscess appeared in the sparrow’s mouth and his form became enfeebled. When the bone was removed the tiger revived and the bird flew up a tree and quoted the Buddha’s scriptures saying, “Killing is vicious and cruel, the greatest of evils. If another had attempted to kill you, how would you like it? You ought to think of others as yourself and seek to save them, then you will exhibit the ‘humaneness of spring’ [1]. The humane who are compassionate to all, will find blessings are their reward as echo responds to sound; the vicious and cruel who harm living things will find misfortunes follow them as shadow pursues form. Think about what I have said!”
The tiger heard the sparrow’s admonition, and agitated, responded furiously, “You have just escaped my jaws, yet you dare to go on like this?”
Saddened, the sparrow realised the tiger was beyond redemption. Pitying him he flew swiftly away.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“The King of the Sparrows was me; the tiger was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達). Era upon era the Enlightened One saves beings with his compassionate heart, being every bit as fearful for them as he is concerned about himself.”
  The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.
  Notes:
[1] The expression ‘humaneness of spring’ (chuntian zhi ren 春天之仁) appears here and in LDJJ 54 and nowhere else in Buddhist nor secular texts that I can find, but may refer to the idea that during the spring, when animals give birth, killing should not be done, seen for example, in the Classic of Rites (Liji 禮記)."

Both set off to visit the region of the naked. The younger said,
“Those who have great good fortune find clothes, and food comes naturally; those of scant luck must strain every sinew to come by them. Now the region of the naked has neither the Buddha, the Law (dharma) nor the assembly of śramaṇas; one could say it is a land without humans, yet we are heading there. Is it not going to be difficult to interpret the meaning of their actions? When we enter the kingdom let us follow their customs, advancing and retreating just as they do, following their rules of decorum, be soft and submissive in speech, hide our intelligence and make a show of ignorance. Such would be the strategy of a Great Man!” [1]
The elder said, “The rites cannot be diminished; virtue must not be resiled from. Will not nakedness contravene our ancient mores?”
The younger said, “The former sages’ guiding principle is that one may neglect one's body but never one's conduct – this is the constant underlying all the rules. Gold within and bronze without, one modulates one's behaviour to conform with what is appropriate for the age; what is initially ridiculed is later praised, that is the greatness of the Responsive Way!” [2]
Finally, they arrived. The elder said, “Now you go ahead and observe what they have and what they lack then send a messenger to let me know how things really are here.”
The younger said, “As you wish.”
Within ten days, the messenger returned and reported to the elder brother, saying, “You must follow the local etiquette.”
The elder brother became agitated and said, “To cast aside the habits of man, and follow the beasts– is that the conduct of the gentleman? [3] My younger brother may behave like that, but I refuse!”
It was the custom of that kingdom on the night of the last day of the month, and that of the fifteenth, all would make merry, smearing sesame oil over their heads and painting their bodies with chalk, wearing necklaces made of various bones and banging two stones together. Men and women would join hands, and dance and sing with abandon. The Bodhisattva joined in, and the people of the kingdom were delighted and full of praise for him. The monarch cherished him and the people respected him; guests waited in succession to meet him. The ruler took all of the goods he had for sale paying him ten times the purchase price. The older brother rode into the kingdom in his carriage, but the manner of his speech was stern and at once he offended the populace. The monarch was enraged and the people contemptuous; they snatched his belongings and flogged him. His younger brother pleaded that he be released so they could both return to their own kingdom. Crowds filled the roads to see off the younger brother, but the curses from the crowd directed at the elder were unpleasant on the ear. The elder was shamed, and said angrily, “How come they are so friendly with you, yet so hostile to me? They gave to you, yet took from me. Are you going to tell me that you did not slander me?”
He tied a knot in his younger brother’s belt and said, “From now on, for generation after generation I will be cruel to you and will never forgive you.”
The Bodhisattva was incredibly sad, and tears fell as he vowed, “If I am permitted generation after generation to meet with a buddha, see the law (dharma), and to personally attend on śramaṇas, I will practice the Four Kindnesses and embrace all, nourishing and saving living beings. I will treat my older brother as myself, and I will not violate this vow.”
From this time on, the older brother was always cruel to the younger, yet the younger always tried to save him.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“At that time the younger brother was me; the elder was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”
  The Bodhisattva’s compassionate, gentle, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.
  Notes:
[1] In pre-Buddhist writings Great Man (dashi 大士) frequently referred to a man of high virtue. Later it became a term for a bodhisattva.
[2] This perhaps refers to the Confucian idea that the Way is flexible and its rules need not be followed slavishly where matters of morality are at stake, one can ‘weigh’ or assess (quan 權) rules to see what is appropriate in the situation: see Hagen, 2010, 14. It may also hope to imply the Buddhist idea of expedient means (upāya) is being invoked. Some translations of this term also contain the character quan 權.
[3] The gentleman (junzi 君子) is the consummate moral man according to Confucian thought."

He had taken refuge in the Three Honoured Ones and upheld all the Ten Good Behaviours. His moral power spread near and far and none did not accept his teaching and change their ways. Weaponry went unused and there were no prisons. The winds and rains arrived in a timely fashion; the kingdom flourished and the populace were wealthy. All quarters remained at peace and the roads were devoid of resentful people sighing over their lot. Ornate fabrications and lesser works were never spoken of throughout the entire kingdom, but the true transformations wrought by the Six Perfections were attested to by all.
At that time there was a brahmin who upheld high standards of moral purity living quietly in the mountain forests, ill at ease with the mores of the day. He applied himself only to maintaining his virtue. One night he was thirsty and went to find a drink, and in error he came across a pond in which someone had planted lotus flowers. Finishing his drink, he realised what he had done and said, “Someone bought this pond and used it to grow lotus flowers to offer at the Buddha temple and to provide himself with water and fruits. I have committed theft by drinking this water without requesting permission from the owner. For the offence of theft, I will first go to the earth-prisons of Mount Tai, next I will be born a domestic animal, butchered and sold in the marketplace and so repay this karmic debt. And if I get to be a person, I will be a slave. It would be better to expiate this as soon as possible in the here and now and not be subjected to any post-mortem suffering.”
So he went to the court to hand himself in for the commission of theft. He said, “I desire, Great Majesty, that you punish me in accordance with the law. If I pay fully for my crime now, I earnestly hope that in the future I will have no more punishment due to me.” [1]
The King told him, “This is naturally occurring water–it’s nothing special, what offence have you committed?”
He replied, “If someone buys a residence and it has a well and a field where the owner nurtures the grass, you can’t draw from that well or mow the grass and take them without permission. I did not ask before I drank, isn’t that theft? I desire Your Majesty judge the matter.”
The King said, “State affairs are rather pressing at the moment, would you mind sitting in the park awhile?”
The Crown Prince took him deep into the gardens. The King had a great deal of business to attend to and he forgot about the brahmin for six days. Suddenly he remembered and said, “Where’s that brahmin got to? Quickly bring him here.”
The brahmin had observed the Rules and had been hungry and thirsty for six days. He came before the King, his frame emaciated. Rising up he staggered to the ground.
The King looked on with tears falling, saying, “I have committed a grave offense.”
But the Queen laughed at him. The King dispatched people to bathe the brahmin and set before him all manner of choice dishes which he offered him with his own hands, he touched his head to the ground and repenting of his error said, “I am the lord of men, when my people are hungry, I am hungry; when they are cold, it is as if my clothing is flimsy. How much more will I feel it when the person involved is one who has embraced the Way and is given over to virtue? The good fortune of having an entire kingdom of good scholars cannot compare with the moral power conferred from having one worthy whose conduct is superior. The kingdom is at peace and the people are secure, the four seasons proceed as they should and the grain harvests are abundant. If that is not the result of the power of the Rules, I don’t know what is!”
He said to the ascetic, “If we were to punish a wrong like drinking water without permission how would we punish really serious crimes? Because of your confession I absolve you from all future punishment.”
The brahmin said, “How wonderful to receive Your Majesty’s beneficence!”
From this time on the Bodhisattva passed through the unending cycle of life and death, and on the verge of attaining Buddhahood, he did not eat for six years. When his guilt had been expiated, he attained the Way. And so Yaśodharā (Juyi 俱夷) following the liberation gave birth to Rāhula (Luoyun 羅云) [2]. The Crown Prince abdicated and zealously practiced austerities in the mountain forests. Those among his followers with erroneous views all said he was mad and their slanders took many forms. The Crown Prince heard them and listened to these disgraceful slanders with forbearance, pursuing them with kindness in an attempt to save them. His good fortune from his previous good acts peaked and he realised the Way. All the heavenly beings assembled in clouds and accepted his teachings and changed their ways. Monarchs and their subjects, without exception, submitted themselves to him.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“At that time the ruler was me, his wife was Yaśodharā and the Crown Prince was Rāhula. Now if you glorify wickedness misfortune will pursue you, but if you give with kindness you will receive good fortune in return. Do not be inattentive! The ruler forgot the ascetic resulting in his starving for six days, and I received six years of hunger before I got some respite. Because after six days the King served the brahmin himself, now only after six years of misfortune did I realise the Way. Yaśodharā laughed at him and now when she was pregnant with Rāhula she suffered six years of serious illness. Because the Crown Prince took the brahmin deep into the gardens, he spent six years in the darkness of the womb. The fool and the benighted are not clear on what to reject and what to encourage, and with a wicked heart turn on the Buddha, the śramaṇas and the brahmin. One who has his hands cut off and his tongue pulled out only suffers for one lifetime; but he who has rashly raises his hand or spuriously slanders others will find himself entering Mount Tai on his death and there the demons of Mount Tai will pull out his tongue, place him on hot sand and have an ox pull a plough over him, and further, burning hot nails will be used be hammered into his five limbs, he will beseech death to come but it will not. The misfortune which attends on evil is such – follow a blameless course!” 
  The Bodhisattva’s accepting, limitless practice of forbearance is like this.
  Notes:
[1] This mirrors the principle, well-established by the Han era, in secular law that one might have one’s sentence commuted or even obtain pardon if one confessed to one’s crimes (zigao 自告) if they had yet to be discovered: see Rickett  1971, 797-8. Here the principle is being applied to potential post-mortem punishments.

"《六度集經》卷5：「（五四）釋家畢罪經「昔者菩薩守戒行淨，積功累德，遂[26]獲如來、無所著、正真道、最正覺，遊處舍衛國。天龍鬼神、帝王臣民靡不[27]歸宗，[A9]蠱道邪術值佛[28]影隆，猶日明盛螢火隱退。貪嫉之興，不覩亡身之火，邪黨[29]搆謀，勸女弟子名曰好首，以毀天尊。國人未獲真諦者，有沈吟之[30]疑，心疑諸沙門，王亦怪焉。蠱道貪濁，諍財相訴，濁現禍歸，即時見廢，貞真照現，天人歎善！王詣精舍頓首悔過，由斯王有慚心，因媒啟問，求佛女妹，結婚姻之固，以絕釋家之怨。眾祐曰：『吾去家為沙門，不[31]豫世業，嫁娶之事，一由父王。』於是遣使者致敬，宣結親之辭。諸釋不許，王曰：『佛處其國爾由往來，明者無怨，愚夫有讐。女吾賤妾之子，何足以致恨乎？』王許曰：『可。』遂成婚姻。有男嗣一，請見諸舅，即之釋國。「時，佛當還開化諸釋，諸釋欣欣興佛精舍，掘土三尺，以栴檀香填之，[32]撿國眾寶為佛精舍，焜焜奕奕有若天宮，聲[33]聞隣國靡不躍逸。佛未坐之，而[34]彼庶子入觀曰：『斯精舍之[35]巧、眾珍之妙，[＊]唯天[36]帝宮可為匹矣。』曰：『佛未翔茲，吾一坐座，沒命不恨也。』庶子嬖友，名曰頭佉摩，對曰：『[37]夫亦何失？』即[38]升坐矣。釋氏雄士，壯聲呵曰：『眾祐尊座，天帝不臨，何婢[39]之子敢升座乎？』裂坐更興。庶子出，謂其友曰：『斯辱無外矣！吾若為王，爾無忘茲。』友曰：『俱然。』旋守其母欲為太子，母以妖蠱請如子願。王曰：『古來未聞！無設狂言自招耻也。』妖蠱處內，佞臣巧辭，遂立二[40]嫡分民正治。「大王崩，位立兩國，民隨所悅，仁凶分流，仁即奉兄，兇馳詣叔。[1]友為相國，修治干戈，軍用眾備，以舊事聞。王曰：『可。』即寵雄將武士就路，覩佛[2]道邊坐[3]乎半枯之樹。王進稽首曰：『佛不坐純生而處半枯，將有由乎？』眾祐曰：『斯樹名釋，吾愛其名，以仁道濟其難，潤其枯惠其生也。』王悵然內耻曰：『佛仁弘普，惠逮草木，豈況人乎？』於是旋軍。相國仰察天文，覩釋氏宿福索[4]禍興，[5]復以聞之。軍又出，未至釋氏城有[6]數里，城中弓弩矢聲猶風雨，幢幡傘蓋斷竿截[7]斗，裂鎧斬[8]控，士馬震奔靡不失魄。王又奔歸。釋人啟佛：『當[9]那賊何？』曰：『牢關門，廢壍橋。』王又出軍，目連啟言：『吾欲以羅漢威神化為[10]天網，覆城面四十里，王奈釋人何？』眾祐曰：『無奈罪何？』又言：『[11]跳著他方剎土？』曰：『無奈罪何？』目連言：『吾能攘有形，無奈無形罪何？』眾祐曰：『種惡禍生，孰能攘之？取釋氏一子置吾鉢下，以[12]效其實。』目連如命。「釋諸耆舊承教守門，魔化為舊德，呵諸釋曰：『王假塗有所之，爾其絕彼，將益後[13]尤。佛弟子行，可得爾乎？』魔奮勢拔[14]鑰排門兵入，猶塘[15]決水翻。釋摩[16]南為大將軍，與王先王同師而學，有死友之誓，謂王曰：『住爾兇士一飡之頃，令城中人獲出全命。』王曰：『可。』大將軍臨水向佛，叩頭流淚而曰：『以吾微命請彼少人，願令十方群生皆奉佛教，恕己濟眾，潤合二儀，無為狼蚖之毒殘賊眾生，若斯無道之王矣。』入水以髮纏樹根，有頃命終。王遣使者視之，還如事云。兵入掘地半埋釋人。橫材象牽，概殺之矣，或馬蹟，或兵刃。「佛時首疾，其痛難言。梵[17]王帝釋、四[18]大天王，皆叉手侍，為之痛心。釋人有自歸命三尊者，誦經者，起慈心者。釋有三城，征事未畢，王憶釋摩[＊]南殺身請眾命，為之愴然，旋師罷軍，遣使者致敬曰：『士眾疲勞，還國息師。』異日束[19]修稽首足下。佛教謝，王自愛。使者退，佛視之矣。阿難整法服稽首曰：『佛不虛視，其必有緣。』眾祐曰：『釋罪畢也，王罪興矣。却後七日，太山鬼以火燒王及其臣民，王罪難救猶釋禍難[20]攘矣。』佛使阿難舉鉢，鉢下人亦終。佛將諸沙門至梵志講堂，道[21]經諸釋死地，或有已死或折臂髀脛者，覩佛來，或搏頰呻吟云：『歸命佛、歸命法、歸命聖眾，願十方群生皆獲永康，莫如我等也。』時自然床從地出，其地無間，諸沙門皆坐。佛言：『斯王勃逆，興罪弘廣矣。』又問沙門：『若見屠獵魚網者，獲為飛行皇帝乎？』對曰：『不見。』佛言：『善哉！吾亦不見，以其無四等心惠彼群生故也。』「王行湖邊，眾入水浴，神化為毒[22]虫螫其士眾，毒行身[23]黑，或於水中死者，或百步一里死者。且半入國，兇鬼雲集。宮中夜時人聲物鳴，聚居相持，須旦為命，日月[24]薄蝕，星宿失度，怪異首尾，靡不怨王也。王聞佛戒火變之異，內如湯灼，遣使者參其事。佛說如上，使[25]返具聞，國[26]振瓦崩。王會[27]群臣，議[28]言：『或於山，或於[29]水。』遂乘船入海，強富得從，貧羸留國。王內宮人登船上服，望火解衣，脫陽燧珠著服上。其日雲興，壅壅曀曀，風[30]雨凌凌，笮絕舟漂，臣民僉曰：『[31]弊王行凶，乃致[32]兇禍。』向中之時日出炙陽燧，陽燧化為火，始自王舟，[33]大山鬼神[34]雲集[35]礔礰，率土生入太山地獄。留在岸者，微怖而全。」佛於是日興慈心定，諸沙門問阿難：「佛不出乎？」答曰：「一國大喪，佛興慈定，故為不出也。」佛明晨出，諸沙門稽首[36]于地，[37]釋梵四王、諸龍[38]鬼神、帝王臣民稽首就座。阿難整[39]服，問二國禍變之[40]元：「願釋眾疑，令群生照禍福所由。」佛告阿難：「昔有三國比隣而王，時，佛去世久遠，經典不修。菩薩所處之國，致有湖池，獲魚無數。近國聞喜，[41]資財來買，魚盡慘還。遠國不知，亦無買心。[42]漁獵國者，今釋三億人死者是也。其一國喜欲買魚者，今一城人恐徒亡財者是也。遠國不聞得魚者，今一城中人不知王來者是也。我時見破魚首，失言可之；今已得佛為三界尊，尚不免首疾之殃，豈況凡庶乎？諸弟子端爾心、興[43]德惠、安群生，恕己濟彼，慎無殺生，盜人財物，婬彼非妻，兩舌惡罵，妄言綺語，嫉妬恚癡，誹謗三尊。禍之大莫尚十惡，福榮之尊夫[44]唯十善矣。殺物者為自殺，活物者為自活。[45]策心念惡、口言惡、身行惡，莫若勞心念道、口言道、身行道。施善福追，為惡禍尋，猶響之應聲影之追形也。覩斯變者，慎勿違春天之仁，而尚豺狼之兇也。」佛說經竟，四輩弟子、天龍鬼神，皆大歡喜，稽首而去。」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 30b28-32a2)[26] 獲【大】，獲為【宋】【元】【明】　[27] 歸【大】，師【宋】【元】【明】　[A9] 蠱【CB】【麗-CB】，蟲【大】(cf.

He was sojourning in the kingdom’s capital of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國) and heavenly beings, dragons, ghosts and spirits, rulers and subjects all paid him homage. When noxious doctrines and perverted arts come in contact with the bright magnificence of a Buddha it is like the light of fireflies gradually disappearing in the glare of the sun. But greed and jealousy unwittingly stoke the fires which will destroy the body and an evil faction hatched a scheme to encourage a female disciple called Sundarī (Haoshou 好首) to defame the Heavenly Honoured One [1]. Those people of the kingdom who had not yet grasped the Real Truth indulged in doubtful mutterings and harboured suspicions about the śramaṇas; the ruler also took to grumbling about them. The supporters of these noxious doctrines were polluted by greed and they argued over property and defamed one another. But when corruption goes around, ill-fortune comes around, and they were immediately exposed and dismissed; the upright and true shone forth and Gods and men sighed in approval! The ruler went to the Buddha’s residence and touching his head to the floor repented of his misdemeanours. Because the ruler felt remorse over his behaviour he had a matchmaker make enquiries about seeking the hand of one of the Buddha’s younger sisters in marriage hoping that once the ties of marriage had been finalised, this would bring about an end to the enmity between his own clan and the Śākyas. The Blessed One said, “I left home and became a śramaṇa and no longer concern myself with worldly matters; this is solely the concern of my father, the King.”
So the ruler dispatched envoys to the Buddha’s father to pay his respects and convey his intentions to bind the clans by marriage. The Śākyas would have none of it, but the Śākya king said, “The Buddha lives in his kingdom, and uses it as his base. The wise are without enemies, only the fool has foes. The girl involved is the child of one of my low-ranking concubines, what’s the point of incurring his ire by refusing his request?”
 The Śākya King therefore gave his consent saying, “The marriage can proceed.”
Thereupon the marriage was finalised and soon a male heir was produced [2]. Upon reaching maturity, the child  requested permission to visit his maternal relations and went to the kingdom of the Śākyas. At that time the Buddha was about to go and teach the Śākyas and the Śākyas, delighted at the prospect, had raised a residence for him. They had excavated to a depth of three feet and filled it with the fragrance of sandalwood and had gathered all the precious things in the kingdom to make this residence for the Buddha. It was like a heavenly palace so bright and colourful was its beautiful décor. When news of this reached the neighbouring kingdoms none did not jump at the chance to hasten there. The Buddha had not yet been seated when that concubine’s son entered and had a look, and said, “The skill with which this residence has been constructed and the wonderous treasures used compares only with the Palace of the King of the Gods.”
He said, “The Buddha has not yet arrived. If I just sit in his seat for a moment I won’t regret it even if it costs me my life!”
The concubine’s son had a particular friend by the name of Touqumo (頭佉摩) who answered saying, “What have you got to lose?”
And so, he ascended to the seat. One of the Śākya valiants vigorously berated him saying, “That is the seat of the Honoured Blessed One! Even the King of the Gods wouldn’t go near it! How dare you, the son of a concubine, ascend to his seat?”
He broke the seat apart and erected another. The concubine’s son left and said to his friend, “Nothing could be as insulting as this! If I ever become king, do not forget to remind me of this incident.”
His friend replied, “I most certainly will.”
He returned to look after his mother desiring that he should be declared Crown Prince. His mother tried use her wicked wiles to see her son’s desires accommodated, but the King responded, “Since ancient times never has such a thing been heard of! I will not allow such wild talk – you bring shame on yourself!”
But she worked these wicked wiles within the court and following some well-placed words to some sycophantic officials two principal wives were installed [it being intended that their sons eventually] divide the governance of the populace between them. When the great King died two separate kingdoms were established and the populace followed the ruler they preferred; the humane and the wicked went their separate ways. The humane were quick to follow the elder brother and the wicked were swift to go with the younger. The friend of the latter became his Chief Minister and he repaired and restored the weaponry and prepared the military for conflict, then reminded his monarch about past events. The ruler said, “Very well.”
He promptly he set out with his favoured general and troops. He saw the Buddha sitting by the side of the road by a half-withered tree. The ruler came forward and knelt and touched his head to the ground in respect and said, “Is there a reason you have chosen not to sit by a beautiful flourishing tree, but rather by this half-withered one?”
The Blessed One said, “This tree is called the Śākya tree, I am fond of its name being that of my clan and I mean to rescue it from its difficulties, moistening its parched sections and giving it life employing the way of humaneness.”
The King felt miserable and ashamed and said to himself, “The Buddha’s humaneness is so wide-ranging that his favour even reaches vegetation, how much more will it reach men?” And he turned his troops around. The Chief Minister looked up to inspect the configuration of the Heavens and saw that the Śākyas’ good karma acquired in previous eras was coming to an end and that misfortunes were in the ascendant. Again, he reported this and the troops were sent out once again. Before they had arrived at the city of the Śākyas, still several miles away, from within the city bows released their arrows. With a sound like wind and rain, they broke the poles and rent the cloth of the banners and canopies, piercing armour and severing reins [3]. Horses and men ran away, all terrified out of their wits. The King also retreated swiftly. The Śākyas informed the Buddha and asked, “How shall we deal with those bandits?”
He replied, “Secure the gates and remove the bridges over the moat.”
The King once again set out with his forces. Maudgalyāyana (Mulian 目連) reported this to the Buddha and said, “I want to use my arhats’ awesome power to transform into a heavenly net to cover the city over an area of a dozen square miles. What could the King do against the Śākyas then?”
The Blessed One said, “There is nothing to be done about their wrongdoing.”
He went on, “I could leap up and take this place to another world (kṣetra).”
The reply was, “There is nothing to be done about their wrongdoing.”
Maudgalyāyana said, “I can disrupt anything with a physical form, but what can be done against formless wrongdoing?”
The Blessed One said, “Plant the seeds of wickedness and misfortune will grow, who can disrupt that? Take a Śākya child and place it beneath my alms bowl and what happens to him will illustrate the truth of what I am saying.” 
Maudgalyāyana did as ordered. The elders of the Śākya clan acted on the advice they had been given and were guarding the gates when Māra (Mo 魔) transformed into a virtuous elder scolded the Śākyas saying, “If a king asks permission to travel through your domain on the way to somewhere else and you cut off his route, you will later be judged to be at great fault. As those who live as disciples of the Buddha, do you want that?”
Then Māra exerted all his power and pulled out the cross bolts which barred the gates and soldiers flooded in like the waters of a river through a ruptured dyke. Śākya Mahānāma (Shi Monan 釋摩南 var.男) was the general in charge of the Śākyan troops and had studied under the same master His Majesty, the former king, and had vowed friendship unto death with him. He said to the King, “Stay your fierce warriors for the time it takes to eat a meal and allow the city folk to escape with their lives.” 
The King said, “Very well.”
The great general went to the riverside and faced the Buddha. He touched his head to the ground in respect, tears flowing and said, “I request that I may use my worthless life to save a few people, and I vow that in the future I will cause all living beings in the Ten Directions to follow the Buddha’s teachings, and to selflessly save beings, so that their nourishing is equal that of the Two Powers [4], and that none use the poison of wolf or viper to slaughter living beings like this immoral king is doing.”
He entered the water and wound his hair around a tree root and in a short while he was dead. The King sent an envoy who saw what had happened and returned to report on the matter. The troops then entered the city and excavated a trench and half-buried the Śākyas, then had an elephant pull a cross beam over them killing most; some were then trampled by horses and others were stabbed by the soldiery. Then the Buddha’s head began to hurt and the pain was indescribable. Brahmā, Śakra and the Four Great Heavenly Kings all saluted the Buddha and stood attentively at his side, sorely grieved by this. Those among the Śākyas who had taken refuge in the Three Honoured Ones some recited scripture and others had a compassionate heart rise up within. The Śākyas had three cities, but before this punitive mission had been completed the King recalled Śākya Mahānāma’s request that his life be taken instead of the multitudes’ and felt sorrow on his account. He withdrew his troops turning them around halting the army’s advance. He dispatched an envoy to pay his respects and said, “The troops are weary, we are returning to my kingdom where they can rest. On another occasion I will bring you a token of my desire to study under you and touch my head to your feet in respect.”
As the Buddha bade the envoy farewell, asking that the King should take care of himself. The envoy withdrew and the Buddha watched him go. Ānanda (A’nan 阿難) adjusted his robes and touched his head to the ground in respect, and said, “It is not without reason the Buddha watches him, he certainly has fate awaiting him.”
The Blessed One said, “The Śākyas’ guilt has been expiated; now the King’s guilt will come into play. After seven days the demons of Mount Tai will be roasting the King and his people; it would be as difficult to save the King from this punishment as it would have been difficult to extract the Śākyas from their misfortune.”
The Buddha then instructed Ānanda to lift up his alms-bowl and the person beneath it was dead. The Buddha led the śramaṇas to the brahmins’ lecture hall. Along the route Śākyas lay dead; some were already dead but some had severed arms or legs and when they saw the Buddha coming some slapped their faces and moaned saying, “Take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the Law (dharma), and take refuge in the Sagely Multitude (saṃgha)! I desire that all beings in the ten directions achieve eternal peace and none end up like us!”
At that moment couches arose spontaneously from the ground, yet the ground showed no cracks, and all the śramaṇas sat down. The Buddha said, “This King’s violent attack will give rise to wide-ranging punishment.”
He also asked the śramaṇas, “Did you ever see a butcher, a hunter or a fishman get to be a Flying Emperor (cakravartin)?”
They replied, “Never.”
The Buddha said, “Very good! Neither have I, because they do not possess the Four Equal States of Mind [5] that benefit other living beings.”
The King was out walking by a lakeside where a multitude were bathing. A spirit transformed into a poisonous creature and stung these bathers and as the poison worked their bodies turned black; some died right there in the water and some walked one hundred paces, some a hundred yards, before dying. Those who got back to the capital were beset by a cloud of ghastly demons. During the night the sound of men’s cries and things howling could be heard, people huddled together hoping to live until morning. The sun and moon were eclipsed and the constellations veered from their usual course; strange portents came one after the other, and everyone blamed their King.
The King had heard of the Buddha’s admonitions and the calamity of being consumed by fire which was to befall him. Within he felt like he was boiling and roasting so sent an envoy to consult with him. The Buddha merely repeated what he had already said and the envoy returned and reported this to the King. The kingdom shook so much tiles crumbled. The King gathered his officials and discussed the situation. It was decided that some should take to the mountains and others should take to the waters. The King thereupon boarded a vessel and put out to sea. The rich and powerful got to follow the king, the poor and feeble had to stay in the kingdom. A palace woman from the inner quarters boarded the boat in her ceremonial robes, but anticipating the fire she took off her robes and also her solar-kindling-pearl [6] and placed it on top of them. That day the clouds rose blocking the sun and it was gloomy, the wind and rain made it very cold. The bamboo cables snapped and the boat was tossed around by the winds. Officials and people all cried, “Our corrupt King has done such violence it has brought this terrible misfortune upon us.”
As midday approached the sun came out and shone on the solar-kindler which transformed the sunlight into flames. Then clouds of demons from Mount Tai appeared with a clap of thunder and, starting with the those aboard the King’s vessel, the people of the kingdom were taken, still alive, into the earth-prisons of Mount Tai. Those left on the shore were a little frightened but were unhurt.
On that day the Buddha had given rise to a state of compassionate medatative concentration, and the śramaṇas asked Ānanda, “Is the Buddha not coming out?”
Ānanda replied, “The entire kingdom is in mourning and the Buddha has given rise to a compassionate medatative concentration and so will not come out to you.”
The following morning the Buddha emerged and the śramaṇas touched their heads to the ground in respect, Śakra, Brahmā and the Four Kings, all the dragons and ghosts and spirits, monarchs and their subjects all touched their heads to the ground in respect and took a seat. Ānanda adjusted his robes and asked about the origins of the calamities and misfortunes that befell the two kingdoms, hoping their myriad doubts on the matter would be dispelled giving rise to an understanding of the reasons why living beings experience good or bad fortune.
The Buddha told Ānanda, “In the past there were three rulers of neighbouring kingdoms. At that time it had been a very long time since a buddha has last departed from this world and the wisdom of the scriptures was not cultivated. In the kingdom where the Bodhisattva lived there was a lake where countless fish had been landed. The nearest kingdom heard this news with great joy and brought means to buy them. But the supply of fish  had been exhausted, and they returned home diisappointed. The more distant kingdom did not get to know of the fish and so had conceived no desire to buy them. Those of the kingdom of the fishermen, they were today’s three hundred thousand Śākyas who perished. The country where the people were delighted and wanted to buy the fish, were today’s city people who were terrified and lost their wealth. Those of the more distant kingdom who did not get to hear of the fish were the people who today did not even know of the King’s arrival. At that time, I saw a fish being hit on the head, and failing to speak up I let it happen; now I have attained Buddhahood and am honoured by the Three Realms, yet I was still unable to avoid the misfortune of a headache – how much more unlikely is it that ordinary folk could avoid their karmic fate? Disciples! Rectify your minds, and encourage kindness, make all beings safe and think of others as yourself and seek to save them. Take great care not to kill living things, not to steal the things of others, not to indulge in lascivious acts with women not your wives, not be inconstant, abusive, untrue, or improper in speech, not jealous, angry and deluded in deed, and do not slander the Three Honoured Ones. Nothing brings disaster like the Ten Evils; only the Ten Good Behaviours can bring about the venerable states of good fortune and glory. Those who kill things, kill themselves; those who allow things to live, are allowing themselves to live. Thinking evil, speaking evil and doing evil cannot be compared with thinking of the Way, speaking in accordance with the Way, and acting in accordance with the Way. If you bestow goodness, good fortune will be your return; if you do evil misfortune will seek you out, just as an echo responds to sound or a shadow pursues form. Those who have witnessed these events, take care not to infringe the ‘humaneness of spring’ [7], and not exalt the viciousness of wolves.”
  When the Buddha had finished explicating the scriptures, the four types of disciple, heavenly beings, dragons, ghosts and spirits were all delighted and having touched their heads to the ground in respect, they left.

[6] The solar-kindling-pearl (yangsui zhu 陽燧珠) seems to be a hybrid of the concave disc with a polished surface used to concentrate the sun’s rays used in China (yangsui) and the ‘fire-pearl’ (huozhu). The latter are thought not to be known in China prior to the Tang: see Schafer, 2014, 237–39.
[7] The expression ‘humaneness of spring’ (chuntian zhi ren 春天之仁) appears here and in LDJJ 51 and nowhere else in Buddhist nor secular texts that I can find, but may refer to the idea that during the spring, when animals give birth, killing should not be done, seen for example, in the Classic of Rites (Liji 禮記)."
"《六度集經》卷6：「（五五）「昔者菩薩，時為凡人，聞佛名號、相好、道力、功德巍巍，諸天共宗，則高行者眾苦都滅矣。菩薩存想，吟泣無寧，曰：『吾從得天師經典翫誦，執行以致為佛，愈眾生病令[7]還本淨乎？』時佛去世，無除饉眾，莫由受聞。隣有凡夫其性貪殘，覩菩[8]薩精進志銳，曰：『吾知佛三戒一章，爾欲稟乎？』菩薩聞之，其喜無量，稽首足下，伏地請戒。知偈者曰：『斯為無上正真、最正覺、道法御、天人師之要教也，子欲徒聞之，豈其然乎？』答曰：『請問法[9]儀，厥義何之？』曰：『爾審懇誠者，身毛一孔一針刺之，血流身痛心不悔者，尊教可聞矣。』答曰：『聞佛則殞，吾欣為之，豈況刺身而生存者乎？』即[10]布針以刺身，血若流泉，菩薩喜於聞法，得無痛之定。「天帝釋覩菩薩志銳，為其愴然，化令舉身一毛孔者有一針矣。其人覩之照厥志高，即授之曰：『守口攝意，身無犯惡，除是三行，得賢徑度。是諸如來、無所著、正真尊、最正覺戒真說也。』菩薩聞戒歡喜稽首，顧視身針霍然不現，顏[11]景弈弈，氣力踰前，天人鬼龍靡不歎懿。志進行高，踵指相尋，遂致得佛，拯濟眾生。」佛告諸比丘：「授菩薩偈者，今調達是。調達雖[12]先知佛偈，猶盲執燭[13]炤，彼不自明，何益於己？菩薩銳志度無[14]極精進如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, p. 32a20-b16)[7] 還【大】，逮【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 薩【大】，薩情【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 儀【大】，義【宋】　[10] 布針以【大】，行市針以自【宋】【元】【明】　[11] 景【大】，影【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 先【大】，光【宋】　[13] 炤【大】，照【宋】【元】【明】　[14] 極【大】，極行【宋】【元】【明】","In former times the Bodhisattva, then an ordinary person, heard of the Buddha’s name, of his major and minor marks, of the power of his Way, of his towering morality venerated by all heavenly beings, and that all those who emulated his lofty conduct saw their many sufferings extinguished. He pondered on this and wept unable to find peace. He vowed, “I will seek out and obtain the Heavenly Teacher’s works, study them intensively and recite them. I will put the teachings into practice so that I become a buddha and heal the ills of living beings causing them to return to a state of fundamental purity!”
At that time the Buddha had gone from the world and there were no monastics, so there was nobody from whom he could receive the Buddhist teachings. Nearby lived an ordinary man, by nature greedy and ruthless and he observed the Bodhisattva, zealous in his keen resolve. He said, “I know a verse that encapsulates the three sets of the Buddha’s rules  – would you like to have it?”
When the Bodhisattva heard this his happiness knew no bounds and he touched his head to his feet in respect and lay prostrate on the ground begging for the rules. The one who knew the verse said, “This is the essential teaching of the One of Supreme, Perfect Awakening, the Charioteer of the Dharma, Teacher of Gods and Men. You want to hear it as a disciple, is that the case?”
He replied, “Please may I ask the correct way to receive the Law (dharma). Do you know how I should behave?”
He said, “If you are really sincere you should insert a needle into each and every pore. When the blood is flowing and you are in agony, yet remain without regret, then you can hear the honoured teachings.”
He replied, “If hearing the Buddha’s teaching would mean the death of me I would happily do it, how much more am I be prepared to have my body pierced with needles and remain alive?”
So, his body was pierced all over with needles and blood flowed as if out of a spring. The Bodhisattva was happy that he was going to hear the Law and attained the Concentration of No Pain. The King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), saw the Bodhisattva’s keen resolve and was grieved for him. He magically supported his body with needles in every pore. The man saw this and understood his resolve was high so promptly gave him the verse saying,
“‘Be guarded in speech, controlled in thought, avoid all evil deeds;
Only through practice of all these three will excellence be reached and one free’d.’
This is the true teaching of the rules of the Thus-come One, the One With No Ties, the Honoured One of Supreme, Perfect Awakening.”
The Bodhisattva heard the rules and happily touched his head to the ground in respect, then looking at his body he saw the needles had suddenly disappeared. His face was aglow and his energies stronger than before. None among the gods, ghosts and dragons did not praise his virtues. His resolve advanced and his conduct became more and more lofty, one step at a time, resulting in his attainment of buddhahood and the saving of living beings.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“The one who gave the Bodhisattva the verses is now Devadatta (Diaoda 調達). Although Devadatta knew the verse before the Buddha he was like a blind man holding a torch – the light did not illuminate things for him, so what good did it do him?” 
  The Bodhisattva’s determined, limitless practice of zeal is like this."

At that time there was a severe drought and fruit was in short supply, but the royal city of the kingdom was not far away, set apart by a small river, and the monkey king lead his troop into its gardens to eat fruit. The steward of the gardens reported this and the King said, “Secretly keep an eye on them – don’t let them get away!”
The Monkey King realised what was afoot and grieved, saying, “I am the group’s leader, their bad or good fortune flows from me. In my greed for fruit to save their lives I have led my troop into error.”
He issued orders to his troop saying, “Spread out and search for vines.” [1]
The troop returned with vines and competed one with the other to tie the vines together. Then they tied one end to the branch of a big tree and the monkey king tied the other end around his waist and climbed the tree and threw himself over the river, grabbing onto a tree branch on the other side. The vines were slightly too short, and his body dangled in the air. He ordered his troop, “Quickly climb along the vines and cross over.”
By the time the troop had finished crossing, his armpits had split apart and he fell to the riverbank. He regained consciousness just as the King, who had risen early to go and inspect the situation, arrived to capture the great monkey. The Monkey King was able to speak human language and paid his respects, touching his head to the ground, and explained everything saying, “Wild animals crave life and we rely on your favour as your vassals. At the time there was a drought and fruits were few so we encroached upon your heavenly garden. The wrong rests solely with me. Please spare the others. The rancid flesh on my lowly form can supply your Grand Provisioner [2] with a day’s meat.”
The King looked up and sighed, “This leader of lowly beasts will sacrifice himself to save his troop – he is in possession of the wide-ranging humaneness of the worthies of antiquity! I am a lord of men – can I compare with him?”
He shed tears for the monkey, ordered his bonds be untied, and supported him to a quiet place. He ordered that throughout the entire kingdom monkeys be permitted to eat whatever they liked and anyone contravening this order be treated the same a thief. On his return, he went to the queen and told her only of this humane behaviour: “Even the conduct of the worthies of antiquity did not equal this! My kindness is the size of a silken strand of hair, his is larger than Mount Kunlun (崑崙)!” [3]
The Queen said, “How excellent! How strange this should be seen in such a lowly beast. Your Majesty should indulge him with whatever he wants to eat and not permit the masses to harm him.”
The King replied, “I have already issued such orders.”
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“The Monkey King was me, the ruler of the kingdom was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難), and the five hundred monkeys are today’s five hundred bhikṣus.”
  The Bodhisattva’s determined, limitless practice of zeal is like this.

His strength and power were out of the ordinary and his humane love was universal. His herd admired and followed him. They roamed near the royal gardens and the herdsmen reported their presence. The King led his men who surrounded and contained them. The Deer King understood what was going on and shedding tears said, “The trouble you find yourselves in is down to me. I will sacrifice my life to save you lesser deer.”
The Deer King went to the rope barrier, went down on his front feet, saying, “Climb up on me, then jump out of the enclosure and you will be saved.”
The herd did as he suggested and they all avoided capture.
The Deer King’s flesh was split and blood flowed as from a spring. He fell to the ground barely breathing, his agonies indescribable. The herd cried out, pacing up and down refusing to leave. The human king saw his injured body, his blood reddening the ground. He did not see the herd and said, “What happened?”
The Deer King answered, “My moral conduct was not good and I was born as an animal, and in my search for sweet grasses to sustain my insignificant life, I violated your borders and for this crime I ought to be punished severely. Although my flesh is all but gone, I still have two limbs and five internal organs intact which I hope could supply the Grand Provisioner [1] enough for a day’s meals.”
The King said, “How did this come about?”
The Deer King told him the whole story. The King grieved for him and shed tears saying, “You were born a beast, yet you have the wide-ranging humaneness of Heaven and Earth within. You destroyed your own life to save your herd; I am a lord of men and my greed has made me enjoy killing that given life by Heaven.”
He issued an important decree commanding the common folk of the kingdom to cease hunting from this day on, and informing them that he no longer desired venison. He severed the ropes of the enclosure, lifted the deer and placed him somewhere quiet on level ground. When the herd saw their king they raised their heads to Heaven in lamentation and each went forward to lick his wounds. Then they spread out to gather medicinal herbs which they chewed to a paste and applied to his cuts. The human king observed them and had to repeatedly wipe away his tears, “If the lord uses the love he feels for his child to cherish the masses, the masses will show their admiration for their lord by treating him with the affection due to a parent. Can the lord’s Way be anything other than humaneness?”
From this time on he refrained from killing and exalted humaneness, and Heaven bestowed blessings on him. The kingdom flourished and the people thrived. His reputation for humaneness was declared near and far, and people streamed to his kingdom for sanctuary.
  The Buddha told Śāriputra (Qiuliuzi 鶖鷺子):
“The Deer King was me and the five hundred deer were today’s five hundred bhikṣus. The human king was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難).”

His pelt of nine hues was such as is rarely seen in the world. He was disporting himself by the banks of a river when he saw a drowning man crying out piteously for Heaven to save him. The deer grieved for him and said, “Human life is so difficult to obtain and he is about to die! I had better throw myself into danger and try to save him.”
He swam quickly over to him and said, “Do not be afraid! Grab onto my antlers and climb onto my back – I will save you.”
The man did as he was told. By the time the deer had got him out, his breathing was shallow and he was close to death. The man revived and was overjoyed. He circumambulated the deer three times and touched his head to the ground in deference and announced, “Birth as a human is difficult to happen upon. One’s life is of paramount importance, you, sir, threw yourself into danger to save this important life of mine, your kindness surpasses that of the Two Powers [1]. I will never forget this and I want to be your servant and provide for your every need.”
The deer said, “Be off with you! I would be an encumbrance to you for the rest of your life. However, should someone come looking for me, do not tell them you have seen me.”
The man rescued from drowning respectfully assented, “Until my dying day I will not disobey this request.”
At that time the ruler of the kingdom was called Moyinguang (摩因光), a man of talent and tenacity, unaffected and mild-mannered, who cared for his people with kindness. The ruler’s primary consort was called Hezhi (和致) and in a dream she saw a Deer King with a pelt of nine hues, his horns larger that that of a rhinoceros. On awakening she related this to her husband saying, “I want that deer’s pelt and horns to make a coat and some earrings. If I don’t get them, I will be sure to perish.”
The ruler, troubled, said, “It can be done.”
In the morning he went to his assembled officials and described the deer. A proclamation was issued soliciting assistance in the search for the deer, offering a reward to the one who captured it of enfeoffment with a county, and an award of a golden bowl filled with grains of silver and a silver bowl filled with grains of gold. When the man who had nearly drowned saw this solicitation he was delighted and said, “I am going to get a county and bowls full of gold and silver and be happy for the rest of my life! The deer put his own life in danger – how could I have anticipated that?”
And he promptly went to the palace to report what he knew of these matters and within moments of his doing so his face became leprous and his mouth became rotten and fetid. He said gravely, “This deer has numinous powers. Your Majesty should lead the masses and capture him!”
The ruler promptly raised an army and crossed the river in search of him. At that time the deer was with his old friend the crow. As he had lain down to sleep, he was not aware that the ruler had arrived and the crow said, “My friend! The ruler is on his way to capture you!”
The deer was exhausted and did not hear so the crow pecked his ear and repeatedly told him, “The ruler is here to kill you!”
The deer was startled and saw the ruler drawing back his bow and aiming at him and he swiftly approached him and knelt before him with his head touching the ground in respect, and said, “Heavenly Majesty, might I have a little time to relate my humble situation?”
 The ruler saw the deer like this and ordered the arrows stayed. The deer said, “Your Majesty cherishes your consort and personally labours to deliver whatever she wishes. Ultimately, my death cannot be avoided. But your Heavenly Majesty resides deep within the confines of the palace. How did you find out my insignificant person would be here?”
The King pointed and said, “It was that leper who told me.”
The deer said, “I was looking for some sweet grass to eat and, in the distance, I saw a man drowning and crying out piteously for Heaven to save him. Feeling extreme sympathy for him I put myself in danger to save him. When this man reached the bank, he was delighted and bent his head to the ground in respect and said, ‘My life was nearly lost yet Your Lordship saved me. I wish to serve you for the rest of my life and keep you in water and grass.’ I replied to him saying, ‘Be off with you! Go wherever you please, but take care not to tell anyone where I am.’”
The Deer King continued, “I’d have been better off removing the grass and wood floating on the water and placing it on dry land than helping a man who gives nothing in return. Stealing riches or slaughtering one’s master, such evil acts can be understood; but receiving kindness then plotting against the person who bestowed it? Such ruthlessness is difficult to explain!”
The ruler was surprised and said, “How could this animal embrace such far-reaching kindness that he would risk his own life to save another without regard to the danger – this deer is certainly divine!”
The ruler thought highly of the deer’s words and in his delight advanced his moral standing. He issued a decree to his kingdom which stated, “From this day on deer are permitted to eat whatever they please. Offenders who prevent them from doing so will be punished by death.”
The ruler went home and when his wife heard he had released the deer her fury was so intense her heart fragmented. She died and entered the earth-prisons of Mount Tai. The King of the Gods Śakra (Tiandi Shi天帝釋) heard that the ruler had established such lofty resolve to be kind and praised him for doing so, but to test him he conjured up some deer-like beings which filled the kingdom and ate the grain; the grain and other crops throughout the territory were all completely gone. The common folk lodged a complaint with the ruler. The ruler said, “It is preferable to suffer death while keeping one’s word than to protect the kingdom with some inauspicious deception!”
Śakra said, “This ruler is truly a man of his word!”
He sent the deer away and they each left. The grain harvest increased ten-fold, calamities were averted, and all troubles disappeared of their own accord.
  The Buddha told the bhiksus:
“At that time the Deer King was me, the crow was Ānanda (A’nan 阿難) and the King was Śāriputra (Quiluzi 鶖鷺子). The drowning man was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達) and the ruler’s wife was Devadatta’s wife.”

"《六度集經》卷6：「（五九）「昔者菩薩，身為馬王，名曰[22]駈耶，常處海邊[23]渡漂流人。時，海彼岸有婬女鬼，其數甚多，若覩商人，即化為城郭居處，田園伎樂飲食，變為美人，顏華[24]暐曄，要請商人，酒樂娛之。鬼魅惑人，皆留匹偶，一年之間，婬鬼厭故，以鐵錞刺其[25]咽，飲其血、食其肉、吮其髓。馬王遙覩婬鬼噉人，為之流淚。因飛渡海，之海彼岸，獲成擣[26]粳米，馬王食飲畢，登山呼曰：『誰欲度者？』如此三矣。商人聞之喜曰：『常聞神馬哀度危難，今其[A4]臻乎！』喜而趣之，曰：『哀度吾等。』馬曰：『爾等去者，婬鬼必當提子示爾，[27]號呼而追。有顧戀之心者，吾去[28]後，鬼必復以鐵錞[29]錞爾[＊]咽，飲爾血、吞爾肉。正心存善，可得全命矣。夫欲歸者，騎吾背援吾[30]鬣尾，捉[31]頭頸自由所執，更相攀援，必活覩親也。』商人信用其言者，皆獲全命歸覩六親，婬惑之徒信鬼妖蠱靡不見噉。夫信正去邪，現世永康矣。」佛告諸比丘：「時馬王者，吾身是也。菩薩銳志度無極精進如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, p. 33b24-c14)[22] 駈【大】，𩣩【宋】【元】【明】　[23] 渡【大】＊，度【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[24] 暐【大】，輝【宋】【元】【明】　[25] 咽【大】＊，胭【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[26] 粳【大】，粇【宋】【元】【明】　[A4] 臻【CB】【麗-CB】，瑧【大】(cf.

He always lived by the seashore and saved people adrift at sea. At that time on the far shore there were great numbers of debauched female demons and when they saw any merchants they would conjure up a walled city with residences, fields and gardens, musical and dancing, food and drink and change themselves into beautiful women, of elegant and resplendent appearance, then invite the merchants to drink wine, make merry and amuse themselves. These wicked demons confused the men and they all ended up staying and becoming their spouses, but within the year, because these debauched demons had tired of them, they stabbed them in the throat with an iron spike, drank their blood, ate their flesh, and sucked the marrow from their bones. The Horse King observed from afar these debauched demons feeding on these men and he wept for them. So he flew across the sea to the other shore. Having found and prepared some rice, the Horse King ate and drank and when finished climbed to the top of a mountain and shouted, “Who wants to be saved?”
He did this three times. The merchants heard him and said happily, “We’ve always heard tell of a divine horse who compassionately saves from danger and difficulty! Now he is here!”
They happily rushed towards him, saying, “In your compassion, save us!”
The horse said, “When you are about to leave the debauched demons will certainly hold up your sons and show them to you. They will call out piteously and pursue you. Anyone who turns round with a loving heart, after I have gone, the demons will certainly stab you too in the throat with an iron spike and drink your blood and swallow your flesh. If you keep an upright mind and remain focused on the good you can save your lives. Those who want to go home climb on my back, hang on to my mane or tail, or grasp my neck and whatever you hold on to, hang on to one another, and you will certainly live to see your loved ones!”
Those merchants who took him at his word all saved themselves and returned to see their entire family; those who were bewitched and trusted in the demons’ sorcery were all devoured. Trust in the correct and dispel the wicked, and in this life and you will have constant peace.
  The Buddha told the bhiksus:
“At that time, the Horse King was me.”

He had ministers to his left and right who embraced lofty moral conduct and constantly kept in mind the teachings of the Buddha, not setting them aside even when eating or resting. They ate only enough aquatic plants to keep them going. They cared for the young in their school with kindness and protected them as they would themselves. As they played with them in the flow of the tide, they taught them the Buddha’s Rules. Undetected, fishermen had pinned the school under a net, and all the fish, old and young, were terrified. The Fish King said with compassion, “Have no fear! Whole-heartedly keep the Buddha in mind and hope that all living beings achieve peace. To this great vow of universal kindness heavenly blessings will respond as an echo does to sound. Come quickly one after the other, I will save you.”
The Fish King planted his head in the mud and raised the net and kept it in place with his tail allowing all the fish to swim swiftly out. The entire school of fish got to live and none did not submit to the King regarding him with great affection.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“At that time the Fish King was me. My ministers to his left and right were Śāriputra (Quiluzi 鶖鷺子) and Mahāmaudgalyāyana (Damuqianlian 大目揵連).”

Day and night he zealously considered efficacious methods that might cause the spirits of sentient beings to return to Original Non-Being [1].  Further there was another turtle king and they lived together deep in the mountains. Together they observed a lizard climb a tree and throw himself off, who he kept on and on doing so. The Bodhisattva interpreted this behaviour saying, “This is a sign that we are in danger! It would be best if we make ourselves scarce as soon as we can!”
The other turtle king was determined to go his own stupid way and paid no heed to this accurate prediction. The Bodhisattva did his utmost to save his followers and see them avoid difficulties. Ten days later an elephant king and his herd arrived at the tree to rest. The lizard threw himself down landing in the elephant’s ear. He trumpeted in fright and the herd stampeded, and in their rush hither and thither they trampled all the turtles to death. The second turtle king said angrily to the other, “You knew about this yet did not point it out, now I am dying, yet you live – where’s the good heartedness? Through kalpa upon kalpa I will seek you out and when I find you, rest assured, I will kill you.”
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“The turtle king who skillfully read the omen was me. The one who insisted on going his own way and staying put was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”

Among them there were two parrots, whose strength surpassed all the others, and they held a bamboo cane in their beaks to make a carriage for their king who sat upon it as they flew around enjoying themselves. Invariably as the King rode his cane chariot, there were groups of five hundred parrots above and below him, in front and behind him, and to his left and his right, his supporters on six sides numbering three thousand in all. He received precious offerings and his amusements aligned with the seasons. The King thought deeply to himself, “The din of the crowds plays havoc with virtue; I have no way of maintaining meditative concentration. I will have to employ an expedient!”
Feigning illness, he did not eat and faked his own death to get rid of his followers. His followers covered him with rush matting and left, abandoning him. Then the King got up and went in search of food. All the parrots had gone to visit the mountain abode of another Parrot King, to whom they announced, “Our King has died and we wish to serve you.”
He replied, “If your King is dead show me his corpse, and if he is indeed dead, I will accept your company into mine.”
 They went back to fetch the corpse, but to their surprise it had disappeared.  They searched in all directions and found their King. They all paid their respects and once again, as of old, made offerings to him.  The King said, “I wasn’t even dead yet and you abandoned me! The buddhas have made it perfectly clear that one should regard the world with favour of the kind one would show a parent and regard only the Way as worthy of veneration as one would an ancestor. Śramaṇas regard hair and whiskers as emblematic of the defilements which play havoc with resolve so get rid of them and adopt lofty conduct devoid of desire. The racket you make is a noxious sound which plays havoc with my resolve; to be alone and without companions is a virtue worthy of the highest sage.”
Having spoken he flew away to a secluded and silent place. He banished desires and practiced non-action, his thoughts fixed only on the practice of concentration. All his defilements were annihilated and his mind became [as pure as] heavenly gold.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“At that time the Parrot King was me.”

The ruler noticed them and ordered his Director of Pasturage to spread out a net for their capture. Each and every member of the flock, large and small, were locked in a cage and fed rice to fatten them up so the Grand Provisioner [1] could use them in preparation of delicacies in the royal kitchens.
Once captured, the King of the Pigeons wholeheartedly kept the Buddha in mind, repenting his faults and with rising compassion vowed, “May all captured beings gain release, be swiftly distanced from the Eight Difficulties, and none end up like me!”
He addressed his flock: “Among the many things proscribed by the Buddha’s scriptures greed is the foremost. Anyone who has obtained glory through greed is like a starving man given a toxic brew to drink. The joy of getting what he yearned for will be as short-lived as a lightning flash, yet the sufferings he brings upon himself will last one hundred thousand years. Refrain from eating and your life will be preserved!”
They replied, “We have been captured and shut in a cage, what hope is there for us?”
 “Of those who turn their back on the Buddha’s teachings and indulge their greed and desire, there are none who will not perish!” retorted their king.
He ceased eating and his well-nourished frame grew daily thinner. Before long he was able to escape through the bars of his cage. Turning to the others he proclaimed, “Eliminate greed and refrain from eating and you can be like me!”
He finished speaking and flew away.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “That Pigeon King was me.”

"《六度集經》卷6：「（六四）[19]佛說蜜蜂王經聞如是：一時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。佛告[20]諸弟子：「當勤精進聽聞諷誦，莫得懈怠陰蓋所覆。吾念過去無數劫時，有佛名一切度王如來、無所著、最正覺，時為一切諸天人民不可計數而說經法。是時眾中有兩比丘，其一比丘名精進辯，一比丘名德樂[21]正，共聽經法。精進辯者聞經歡喜，應時即得阿惟越致，神通具足；德樂[＊]正者，睡眠不覺，獨無所得。時，精進辯謂德樂[＊]正言：『佛者難值，億百千世時乃一出耳，當曼精進為眾作本，如何睡眠？夫睡眠者陰蓋之罪，當自勗勉有覺寤心。』時德樂[＊]正，聞其教詔便即經行，於祇樹間甫始經行復住睡眠，如是煩亂不能自定，詣泉水側坐欲思惟，復坐睡眠，時，精進辯便以善權往而度之，化作蜜蜂王，飛趣其眼如欲[22]螫之。時，[23]德樂[＊]正驚覺而坐，畏此蜂王，須臾復睡，時，蜜蜂王飛入腋下[＊]螫其胸腹，德樂[＊]正驚，心中懅悸不敢復睡。時，泉水中有雜色花，[24]憂曇、拘文，種種鮮潔。時，蜜蜂王飛住華上食甘露味，時德樂[＊]正端坐視之，畏復飛來不敢復睡。思惟蜂王觀其根本，[25]蜂王食味不出華中，須臾之頃，蜂王睡眠，墮污泥中；身體沐浴已，復還飛住其華上。時，德樂[＊]正向蜜蜂王說此偈言：「『是食甘露者，  其身得安隱， 不當復持歸，  遍及其妻子。 如何墮泥中，  自污其身體， 如是為無黠，  [26]敗其甘露味。 又如此華者，  不宜久住中， 日沒華還合，  求出則不能。當須日光明，  爾乃復得出， 長夜之疲冥，  如是甚勤苦。』 「時蜜蜂王，向德樂[＊]正，說偈報言：「『佛者譬甘露，  聽聞無厭足， 不當有懈怠，  無益於一切。 五道生死海，  譬如墮污泥， 愛欲所纏裹，  無智為甚迷。日出眾華開，  譬佛之色身， 日[27]沒華還合，  世尊般泥[28]曰。 值見如來世，  當曼精進受， 除去睡陰蓋，  莫呼佛常在。 深法之要慧，  不以色因緣， 其現有智者，  當知為善權。 善權之所度，  有益不唐舉， 而現此變化，  亦以一切故。』 「時德樂[＊]正聽聞其說，即得不起法忍，解諸法本，逮陀隣尼，乃知精進辯善權方便。常獨經行不復懈怠，應時亦得不退轉地。」佛告阿難：「爾時精進辯者，今我身是也。德樂[＊]正者，彌勒是也。」佛語阿難：「我爾時俱與彌勒共聽經法，彌勒時睡眠獨無所得。設我爾時不行善權而救度者，彌勒于今在生死中未得度脫。聞是法者常當精進，廣勸一切皆令除去睡眠之蓋，當造光明智慧之本。」說是事時，無央數人皆發無上平等度意。菩薩銳志度無極精進如是。」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 34b12-35a12)[19] 佛說【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[20] 諸【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[21] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[＊21-1] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[＊21-2] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[＊21-3] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[22] 螫【大】＊，蜇【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[23] 德【大】，得【宋】　[＊21-4] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[＊22-1] 螫【大】＊，蜇【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[＊21-5] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[24] 憂【大】，波【宋】【元】【明】　[＊21-6] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[25] 蜂【大】，蜜蜂【宋】【元】【明】　[＊21-7] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[26] 敗【大】，毀【宋】【元】【明】　[＊21-8] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[27] 沒【大】，入【宋】【元】【明】　[28] 曰【大】，洹【明】　[＊21-9] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[＊21-10] 正【大】＊，止【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊","I heard it thus:
Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國), at his monastery in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu 祇樹) among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada. The Buddha told his disciples: “You must be assiduous in your efforts! Listen and recite what you have learned! Do not succumb to complacency or indolence, these dark obstructions threating to engulf you [1]. I recall that in the past, an uncountable number of kalpas ago, there was a Buddha called King Save-All (Yiqie du wang rulai 一切度王如來), a Thus-come One, One Without Ties, One of Supreme, Perfect Awakening, who explicated the teachings for gods and men in inestimable numbers. Once there were two bhiksus among the crowds who listened to the teachings together, one named Vigour-in-Debate (Jingjingbian 精進辯), the other, Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss (Delezheng 德樂正). When Vigour-in-Debate heard the scriptures, he was overjoyed and immediately attained a state of avaivartika (non-retrogression), in possession of all the divine powers. Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss slept through the teaching so gained absolutely nothing. Vigour-in-Debate admonished Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss, “A buddha is difficult to encounter, only one emerges in every one-hundred million, one hundred thousand generations. You should be unremitting and vigorous in your practice, and persistently put down roots on behalf of living things. How could you fall asleep? The sleeper commits the fault of allowing his mind to be engulfed in darkness. You must exhort yourself to remain fully conscious!”
Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss heard these admonitions and promptly began to practice walking meditation within Jeta’s Grove. But no sooner had he started than he became sleepy once again. He became agitated, unable to still his mind so sat down next to a spring to do some contemplation, but once sitting he became drowsy again. Vigour-in-Debate decided to employ a skilful expedient to save him and transformed into a Bee King and flew quickly towards his eyes as if he were about to sting him. Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss awoke with a start and sat up fearful of this Bee King, but within an instant, he was asleep again. The Bee King then flew in under his arm and stung him on the torso. Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss got a fright and feeling embarrassed and dismayed dared not fall asleep again. Flowers of diverse hues were growing in the spring waters, udumbara, kumuda and other blooms of all kinds, fresh and unblemished. The Bee King flew over and alighted on a flower and began to consume its sweet dew. Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss sat up straight and observed him, fearful the bee would attack again. He did not dare to doze off again and turned his attention to meditating on the Bee King and observation of his origins. The Bee King had been drinking the dew awhile and had not yet emerged from the flower’s interior, then in an instant, the Bee King, having himself fallen asleep, fell out into the mud. Once he had washed himself, he flew back onto the flower. Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss then recited the following verse to the Bee King:
Ought not this drinker of sweet dew
Himself now quite at ease
Take some of this fine nectar home
To share with wife and brood?
  How did he fall into the mud
And so sully his form?
This foolish behaviour
Spoiled the flavour of the dew!
  And in the flowers such as these
One ought not hang around
When the sun goes down, the flowers close up
Begging for release won’t work!
  You must await tomorrow’s dawn
Before you can escape
But this long, dark, exhausting night
Will be full of toil and suffering.
  The Bee King replied in verse to Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss:
The Buddha is like sweet dew
Listen without succumbing to satiety!
There must be no slacking
Or you’ll be of no use to anyone at all.
  The Five Paths through the Sea of Life and Death
Are like my descent into the mud
Desire is what ensnares and binds
And ignorance leads to profound confusion.
  The sun comes up, the flowers open up
The Buddha takes physical form
The sun goes down, the flowers close up
The World Honoured achieves parinirvāṇa.
  In a life one encounters a Thus Come One
Persist in your vigorous practice
Banish sleep’s dark cover
Don’t assume the Buddha will always be there!
  Essential insights of the profound teachings
Don’t come from reliance on form
Those who manifest wisdom
Understand that to be an expedient.
  And those saved by such skills
Gain advantage without grasping in vain
I manifest all these changes
Simply to save one and all.
  When Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss heard these words he promptly achieved the forbearance based on the realization of the non-arising of phenomena (anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti), an understanding of the origins of all phenomena and dhāraṇī and understood Vigour-in-Debate’s skilful expedient. He constantly walked alone in meditation and never again succumbed to complacency or indolence. At the appropriate time he also gained the state of non-retrogression (avaivartika). 
The Buddha told Ānanda (A’nan 阿難): “At that time Vigour-in-Debate was me and Upstanding-in-Virtuous-Bliss was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒).”
The Buddha also told Ānanda: “At that time, I was listening to the teachings with Maitreya who fell asleep and gained absolutely nothing. Had I not then employed a skilful expedient and come to his aid Maitreya would remain unliberated in the Sea of Life and Death. Those who hear these teachings should constantly make great efforts and widely exhort all to throw off the dark cover of sleep and create bright roots of wisdom.”
When the Buddha had finished speaking on this matter uncountable numbers of people resolved to achieve the unequalled liberation.
The Bodhisattva’s determined, limitless practice of zeal is like this.

"《六度集經》卷6：「（六五）佛以三事笑經「昔者菩薩，為清信士，歸命三尊，慈弘仁普，恕濟群生，守清不盜，布施等至，貞淨不妷，觀捐內婬，信同四時、重如須彌，絕酒不飲，尊孝喻親，以正月奉六齋精進無倦，所生遇佛，德行日隆，遂成如來、無所著、正真覺、道法御、天人師，教化周旋。」時行歷市，覩一老[1]翁斗量賣魚，哀慟[2]㘁曰：「怨[3]乎皇天，吾子何咎而早喪身？子存賣魚，吾豈勞乎？」佛覩其然，笑之，口光五色。度市斯須，又覩大猪浴[4]尿行路，佛復笑焉。阿難整服稽首而[5]白：「屬笑人多，莫由[6]敬質；而今重笑，必有教詔。願釋眾疑，為後景模。」世尊告曰：「阿難！吾笑有三因緣。一曰，觀彼老[A5]翁之愚，其為弘普矣。日以𦌘網殘群生命，蓋無絲髮之惻隱；[7]禍子自喪，而怨諸天呼[8]㘁驚怖！斯下愚之行，非二儀之仁，賢聖之恕也，[9]以是笑耳。昔者飛行皇帝，[10]植福巍巍，志憍行逸，今為斗量魚，斯二矣。不想[11]人天，壽八十億四千萬劫，意專著空，不能空空[12]還于本無，福盡受罪今在斗中，斯三矣。」阿難質曰：「飛行皇帝，逮彼尊天，其德巍巍，何故不免於罪乎？」世尊曰：「禍福非真，當有何常？夫處尊榮施四等恩，覺四非常，可免彼[13]禍矣。若因貴自遂，快心從邪，福盡受罪，自古來然。殃[14]福追己，猶影尋形、響之應聲，豈有貴賤哉？惟吾前世為清信士，時，有隣人好奉鬼蠱，姦𦾨為群，不信作惡重禍響應。每至齋日，吾要入佛正真之廟，聽沙門眾散說淨法，以為德本，防絕凶禍，而子婬荒，訛云有務。吾詣佛廟，子往亂道。自斯之後，吾之所生，逢佛聞法與沙門齊志，德行日隆，遂成如來、無所著、正真道、最正覺、道法御、天人師，為三界尊，號曰法王。隣人好事鬼術，殘賊群生，泆蕩女色，酒亂不孝，自謂得志。輪轉三道，苦毒無量。吾已為佛，子續為臭蟲，是以笑之。」佛告阿難：「吾累劫稟經採義，親樂沙門，獲斯巍巍矣。菩薩銳志度無極精進如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, p. 35a12-b21)[1] 翁【大】＊，公【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[2] 㘁【大】，號【宋】【元】【明】　[3] 乎【大】，呼【宋】【元】【明】　[4] 尿【大】，屎【宋】【元】【明】　[5] 白【大】，曰【宋】【元】【明】　[6] 敬質【大】，致敬【宋】　[A5] 翁【CB】【麗-CB】，公【大】(cf.

His compassion was far reaching, his humaneness universal and he was selfless in his saving of living beings; he maintained purity and did not steal, his generosity reaching all equally; chaste, he was never licentious and he observed and eliminated any inner moral laxity; his faith remained the same at all times, as substantial as Mount Sumeru (Xumi 須彌); he eschewed wine, and respectful and filial, he delighted his parents. In the correct manner he reverentially undertook the six fasts each month and was tireless in his vigorous practice. Born when he could encounter a Buddha his virtuous conduct became better by the day. Consequently, he became a Thus Come One, One Free from Attachment, One of Sopreme, Perfect Awakening, a Charioteer of the Dharma, a Teacher of Gods and Men whose teachings and conversions were far reaching.
On one occasion he was passing through the marketplace when he saw an old man selling fish by the bushel cry out in lament, “Heaven has taken against me! Why was my son condemned to an early death? Would I be labouring so hard had he lived to sell these fish himself?”
The Buddha observed his behaviour and smiled, five-coloured rays streaming from his mouth.  He continued across the marketplace and before long he saw a huge pig bathing in filth by the road and he smiled again. Ānanda (A’nan 阿難) straightened his robes, bowed his head in respect and asked, “When you smiled there were many people around, so no one thought it respectful to ask you about it. Yet now you have smiled again: there must be a lesson for us. Please clear up our many doubts and provide us with a model for our future conduct.”
The World Honoured One declared, “Ānanda! There are three reasons for my smile. First, I observed the boundless stupidity of that old man. Each day those square nets of his destroy the lives of living beings and he feels not a shred of pity, yet when disaster befell his son, bereaved himself, he reproaches the gods and utters terrifying cries! This is behaviour of the utmost stupidity; it displays neither the humaneness of the Two Powers [1], nor the selflessness of worthies and sages. This is the first the reason I smiled. In former times a Flying Emperor (cakravartin) who had planted roots of enormous good fortune became arrogant, his conduct self-indulgent; now he is in that bushel of fish! That’s the second reason for my smile. Who would have thought that this heavenly being, who had lived for eighty-four million kalpas, his thoughts fixed firmly on emptiness, was yet unable to regard the empty as empty, and return to original non-being? That his good fortune could run out, and he now reap punishment in this bushel of fish is the third reason for my smile.”
Ananda queried this saying, “A Flying Emperor has reached the position of an exalted deity, his moral power lofty. How come he cannot avoid punishment?”
The World Honoured One replied, “Ill-fortune and good fortune are not real, how could they be permanent? Now, if those in situations of honour or glory practice the Four Kindnesses and realise the Four Impermanents [2], then such misfortune can be avoided. If one takes advantage of one’s status to indulge oneself, swiftly one’s mind will turn to the bad, good fortune will be exhausted and punishment will follow. So it has been since ancient times. Disaster and good fortune will pursue one as shadow follows form, as an echo responds to sound. How could it be a question of high status or low? In a former life I was a layman and at that time I had a neighbour who was fond of propitiating demons with sorcery and who had formed a band of reprobates. He did not believe that doing evil would lead to an increase in his ill-fortune. Each time there was a fast day I invited him to come to the Buddhist temple where he could listen to the śramaṇas disseminate the Pure Way whereby one can plant the roots of virtue that can block and end misfortune. But this person was licentious and unrestrained, and he lied, telling me he was busy. I went to the Buddhist temple and he went his own wicked way. Since then, I achieved births where I encountered a buddha, heard his Law and nurtured the same intent as the śramaṇas. My virtuous conduct improved by the day, and consequently I became a Thus Come One, One Free from Attachment, One of Supreme, Perfect Awakening, a Charioteer of the Dharma, a Teacher of Gods and Men, respected by the Triple World, and called a King of the Law. My neighbour who was fond of practicing the demonic arts, was wicked and cruel to living beings, dissolute and unrestrained in his dealings with women, drank wine indiscriminately and was unfilial. He thought he had achieved his ambitions, but now he cycles through the three unfortunate destinies encountering immeasurable suffering, whereas I am already a Buddha, he continues existence as a loathsome creature. This is the reason I smiled at what I saw.”
The Buddha told Ānanda, “For many kalpas I have received the scriptures and accumulated proper understanding. I enjoyed the company of śramaṇas and so have obtained this lofty position.”
The Bodhisattva’s determined, limitless practice of zeal is like this.

Since youth he upheld the rules, never violating them right from the start; he always kept celibate and lived in a monastery. He was able to recite the prajñā-pāramitā fluently, and the sound of his recitations was marvellous, second to none; those who heard this bhikṣu were all delighted. There was a young boy of seven herding cattle outside the city walls when he heard the sound of the bhikṣu reciting the scriptures in the distance. Immediately he followed the sound and entered the monastery, paid his respects to the bhikṣu and sat to one side to listen to the words of the scriptures. At that time the scripture was explicating the source of form; the boy heard and understood, full of joy. When the scripture recitation was over he questioned the bhikṣu, but the answers he received did not accord with the boy’s understanding and so the young boy took issue with the explanation. The boy’s understanding was truly subtle, of a quality rarely ever encountered. When the bhikṣu heard the boy’s words he felt incredibly happy and marvelled at this extraordinary youngster having such wisdom. The boy left and returned to the place he had left the cattle, but the cows and calves he had been looking after had scattered and wandered off into the mountains. Following their tracks, the boy set off in pursuit hoping to find them, but he encountered a tiger and suffered a fatal injury.
His soul promptly transmigrated and was soon to be born to the principal wife in the family of a well to do householder. While pregnant, this woman became able to explain the prajñā-pāramitā and did so from dawn till dusk without flagging. This household were entirely unaware of the Buddha’s Law (dharma), and bewildered, took what she was saying to be the ravings of a woman possessed by demons. They asked around about how to dispel these demonic influences. They tried everywhere, but no one understood what was going on. The householder was incredibly anxious and could not understand how his wife had contracted this illness. All the family, close and distant, were all very worried.
Just then a bhikṣu came to town and arrived at the householder’s gate on his begging round. From a distance he heard the sound of the scriptures and his heart gladdened, he stopped by the gate awhile. The master happened to come out and saw the bhikṣu but failed to show him the usual respect. The bhikṣu thought this strange, “In this worthy household someone chants the scriptures so wonderfully! Yet the master of the house paid me no heed.”
So he asked the Master, “Who in your household is chanting the profound scriptures so beautifully?”
The householder responded, “That is my wife who seems to have contracted a demonic disease and raves day and night. She never lets up.”
It dawned on the bhikṣu that the householder’s family had not heard the Law (dharma) explained to them and replied, “This is not a demonic illness, she is merely reciting the respected scriptures of the Buddha’s Great Way. Please let me come in and meet with her.”
The householder said, “Very well!”
At once he led the bhikṣu to his wife and when she saw the bhikṣu she immediately made obeisance to him, and the bhikṣu uttered the invocation, “May you swiftly attain buddhahood.”
Then they debated abstruse points of doctrine and time and again she was able to provide explanations which left the bhikṣu overjoyed. The householder asked, “What type of illness is this?”  
The bhikṣu replied, “She’s not ill! She is merely explicating the profound scriptures with excellent reasoning. I suspect the child this woman carries is a disciple of the Buddha.”
The householder, his mind put at rest, urged the bhikṣu to stay and dine with him. When he had finished eating and drinking the bhikṣu then returned to his monastery and told the others what had happened saying, “There is a pregnant householder’s wife who is extremely unusual. She recites the honoured scriptures and speaks fluently, the sound is quite marvellous and her explanations of the meaning of the scriptures are truly profound.”
In the following days the householder invited the bhikṣu again. Word spread that all monks were welcome and food and drink prepared for them. When the time came, they all took their seats and washed themselves. When finished eating and drinking, they intoned a dakṣiṇā in thanks. The wife then emerged to pay her respects to the bhikṣus and sat down to one side. Once again, she joyfully preached the scriptures for the bhikṣus. All those doubts or difficulties the bhikṣus had been unable to resolve were all fully explained and the entire assembly of monks vied with one another to express their delight before returning home.
Her time came and the woman went into labour and gave birth to a boy. There was no evil effluvia after the woman gave birth and the child, as soon as he was born, knelt tall with his palms together and recited the prajñā-pāramitā. After the woman had given birth, she returned to her original state of understanding absolutely nothing. It was as if she had awoken from a dream and recalled nothing of it. The householder once again summoned the assembly of monks. The bhikṣus all gathered and went to see the young child who was reciting the scriptures as if he had been doing so a long time, never making a slip or encountering any obstruction. At this time, each of the monks who made up the assembly wholeheartedly tried to observe the origins of this child but none were able to discern them. The householder asked, “What is going on?”  
The bhikṣus replied, “Truly he is a disciple of the Buddha: take great care not to be frightened or doubt him. Diligently care for him and protect him. In the future when this child is an adult, he will surely be a teacher of many. We must all accept what he tells us.”
By the time the child had reached the age of seven, his knowledge was profound; he understood both the Buddhist Way and the secular. He stood way out from the crowd, his wisdom having no limits. All the bhikṣus and other people followed his instruction and were able to revise their scriptures wherever there was an error or omission thus remedying the defect. Whenever the child went anywhere, he immediately converted people causing them to accept the Great Vehicle. All the householder’s relatives, close and distant, old and young, five hundred in all, followed the child’s teachings and set their mind on the Mahāyāna and all put into practice the Buddha’s work. The child’s teachings within and without the city walls, within the market places, and in the residential areas, resulted in eighty-four thousand people all setting their mind on attaining the Supreme, Perfect Awakening, and five hundred following the Disciple Vehicle. All the bhikṣus who heard the child understood their original defilements and resolving to seek out the Great Vehicle they all attained the the purity of vision of the Dharma.
The Buddha told Ānanda (A’nan 阿難): “At this time the child was me and the bhikṣu was Kāśyapa Buddha (Jaiye Fo 迦葉佛). It is like this Ānanda! In the past I followed this bhikṣu and I heard a portion of the Mahāyāna teachings. I praised its excellent explanations and my mind joyfully never looked back and my efforts never slackened. I gained a profound understanding of my past lives and by my own efforts I attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening. If the power of a single hearing can give rise to such results just imagine the effect of practicing the Way all day!
The Bodhisattva’s determined, limitless practice of zeal is like this."

After several months at sea the precious items they had obtained formed a heavy load that filled the boat. They were about to return to their native land when they encountered stormy weather. Thunder and lightning shook the world and the gods of the seas gathered like clouds, surrounding them like a wall, flames shooting out of their eyes. Mountainous waves surged around them, and they all cried out and sobbed, “We are all going to die!”
Their faces contorted with fear they looked heavenward begging for mercy. The Bodhisattva was distraught, but a plan formed in his mind, “My seeking buddhahood is solely for the benefit of living beings. What the gods of the sea hate most is a corpse. To sacrifice one’s life for the masses is the ultimate deed of the Enlightening Hero. If I do not pour my blood into the sea, which the gods of the sea will hate, the people in the boat will probably never get to shore.”
He addressed the others saying, “Join hands and help me.”
They listened to his instructions and the Bodhisattva then drew a blade and cut his own throat. The gods of the seas detested this, and they floated the boat to the shore thus saving all the passengers. The people on the boat embraced the corpse and cried out to the Heavens and wept, “This man is certainly a bodhisattva and no ordinary follower of the Buddha.”
Beating their breasts and stamping their feet they cried to the Heavens, “To prefer to sacrifice himself to save our lives like this shows he was a man who could not abandon the highest virtue.”
Their words were spoken with sincerity and moved the gods above. The King of the Gods Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋) observed the wide-ranging compassion of the Bodhisattva and realised how rare it was in the world, and Lord Śakra took physical form, descended and said, “This Bodhisattva of consummate virtue will become a Sage Hero, I will now revive him.”
And he poured some divine medicine into his mouth, and also thoroughly anointed the corpse with it. The Bodhisattva promptly revived and all of a sudden sat up and thanked the others. Lord Śakra filled the boat with rare treasures a thousandfold more valuable than they had before and they returned to their native land. Each and every one of the Bodhisattva's relatives were delighted to see him. He assisted the needy with the utmost commitment and came to the aid of the poor, his kindness reaching all living beings. He propagated the Buddhist scriptures, converting the ignorant and benighted. The ruler of the kingdom acknowledged the virtue of the Bodhisattva, and visited to learn from the pure teachings. The ruler was humane, his officials loyal, and all within the boundaries of the territory upheld the rules. Families had filial sons and the kingdom flourished; dangers diminished and the common folk thrived, died of old age, then were born in the Heavens, long separated from the miseries of existence in the human realm. The Bodhisattva zealously practiced without rest for many kalpas and consequently achieved Buddhahood.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:

Each morning he visited the Buddhist temple to dispel the wicked and exalt the True, bowing before the śramaṇas and receiving the Buddha’s divine teachings. In the morning he increased [his knowledge of the teachings], and in the evening he would recite [what he had learned]. His bright intelligence increased daily as he assimilated the knowledge from many scriptures. His sincere admiration of the filial conduct of the ancient worthies was akin to a hungry man dreaming of food. The kingdom where he lived was ruled by an immoral ruler, greedy for wealth and valuing the physical; he denigrated the worthy and despised the common people.
This king was considering impermanence and thought to himself, “If I act improperly, when I die, I will enter Mount Tai. Why not collect some gold to offer to the King of Mount Tai (Taishan wang 太山王)?”
So he raised a levy of gold on the populace, promulgating a severe order, which stated:
“If so much as a grain of gold is hidden, the penalty will be death.”
This went on for three years and the people’s stores of gold were completely exhausted. The King made a false appeal, saying, “If anyone donates even a small amount of gold to your sovereign, I will give them my youngest daughter in marriage and bestow high rank upon them.”
The young boy told him mother, “Some time ago we placed a gold coin in my deceased father’s mouth hoping to bribe the King of Mount Tai. It will certainly still be there. We can get that and present it to the King.”
His mother said, “Very well.”
The boy retrieved the gold and presented it to the King, who ordered the donation be recorded and asked where the gold had come from. The boy replied, “When my father died, we placed gold in his mouth hoping to bribe the King of Mount Tai. In truth, I heard that your Great Majesty would ennoble donors in his quest for gold, so I dug up the grave, removed the wood of his coffin and retrieved the gold.”
The King said, “How long has your father been dead?”
He replied, “Eleven years.”
The King continued, “Did you father manage to bribe the King of Mount Tai?”
The boy responded, “Of all the sagely writings only the Buddha’s teachings are true. The Buddhist scriptures state, ‘Act well and good fortune ensues, do evil and ill-fortune follows.’ Good and ill-fortune are like shadow and echo. Running to avoid your shadow or stroking the mountain to impede the echo, would that work?”
The King said, “It would not.”
The boy said, “The body is composed of the Four Great Elements. When life comes to an end the Four Greats depart, the soul leaves and undergoes a transformation, going to a situation commensurate with one’s actions. What is to be gained by bribery? In a previous era, Your Great Majesty made giving a virtue, and now he has become a king. Your exalted benevolence enriched near and far even though you had not yet attained the Way. As a consequence, in later ages you will certainly become a king again.”
The King was filled with joy, declared a general amnesty for incarcerated criminals and returned the gold he had taken.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus;
 “At that time the King wanted to harm the innocent because he wanted the gold still possessed by the people. The Bodhisattva observed the piteous cries of the people and shed tears for them. He sacrificed himself to the cruel governors and saved the people from the difficulties of the mires and furnaces of the lower births. The people responded to his nourishment and respected the Buddha’s profound rules and consequently the state flourished. At that time the child was me.”

Concentrating his attention on even the smallest of actions he advanced towards his aim like water flowing. On every fast day he would tour the Four Continents [1] on his horse-drawn chariot proclaiming the Buddha’s profound canon and converting living beings causing them to dispel their flaws and esteem the Thus-Come-One, the One Deserving of Respect, the One Awakened to the True, God among Gods, King among Sages, the Venerable Teacher of the Way, the one who can separate them from the Three Mires [2] which are the source of all suffering. Devadatta (Diaoda 調達) was a heavenly demon king and he also traversed the Four Continents teaching people to do evil and to follow their heart’s desires, proclaiming there was no calamitous retribution in Mount Tai. He encountered the Bodhisattva on his travels and asked, “Why are you touring?”
The Bodhisattva answered, “I am instructing the people to follow the Buddha and to cultivate the virtue of the Highest Sage.”
Devadatta said, “I instruct people to indulge their desires, that there is no calamitous retribution in either world, and that being good and working hard to achieve your ambitions will be of no benefit to you.”
The Bodhisattva said, “You keep out of my way!”
Devadatta replied, “Your way of doing good is like gold or silver; my favouring evil is like hardened iron. Hardened iron is able to cut gold and silver, but gold and silver cannot cut hardened iron. If you do not yield the way I will cut you in two.”
Devadatta’s evil flourished but his ill-fortune culminated in his entering Mount Tai while still alive. Now, if people do evil, in every case, on death they will enter the Three Mires. In the Three Mires those who hold to the good will all ascend to the Heavens. It is better to be in the Three Mires and cherish one word of the Buddha than to occupy a position of rank and honour, but embrace great evil.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
 “The heavenly king teaching the people to do good was me. The demon king leading people to evil was Devadatta.”

They chanted the scriptures and explicated their meaning, shedding light on the Six Benighters [1] and how to purify and eliminate inner defilements through calming and contemplative meditative practice. Whenever they heard of a kingdom in the dark about the Three Honoured Ones they immediately set off to go and guide and convert causing them to esteem the Six Paramitās, the right and true wonderful practice.
At that time there was a great kingdom whose ruler had taken delight in the Way but had been bewitched by a group of demons and accepted their evil untruths. All the people the within the borders accepted these teachings and all served this poisonous way. The winds and rains did not come on time and strange phenomena followed one after the other.
The bodhisattvas, elder and younger brothers, discussed the matter and the elder said [2], “Our natal land puts the teachings of the Three Honoured Ones into practice, and people cherish the Ten Good Behaviours. The ruler is humane and the ministers loyal; fathers act with propriety and sons are filial, husbands are trustworthy and wives chaste, worthies live behind every door. Who is left for us to convert? In that country they believe in demons and a dragon [3] lives there who devours the common folk. They cry out, but there is no assistance. Now, we have established an ambition to seek buddhahood, it is precisely in this type of situation we should act. We can convert them with the Way, explaining it to them with kindness. That dragon has a deadly poison, we should destroy it.”
The younger brother responded, “The Buddha’s rules say that killing is the very worst evil, and cherishing life the very apex of the humane way. How could we do that?”
The elder said, “Now, for the injury of a single person the punishment will last one hundred kalpas; the dragon has devoured an entire kingdom, I fear as many kalpas as there are sands in the Ganges will pass before his misfortune will be eliminated. When one seeking to gain a tiny advantage fails to observe the calamity of Mount Tai’s furnaces, it pains me! Human birth is difficult to obtain, the Buddha’s Way is difficult to hear about. By getting rid of the dragon we will save the kingdom then we can guide them with the lofty conduct of the Six Paramitās of the Three Honoured Ones; our misfortune will be hair-thin, but our good fortune will be comparable to that of the Two Powers [4]. You change into an elephant and I will become a lion. If our two lives are not lost, this kingdom will not be saved!”
They bowed their heads to the Ten Directions and vowed, “If this kingdom does not find peace it will be our fault! In the future we will attain Buddhahood and will save all.”
The elephant went to the dragon’s lair and the lion pounced on the dragon. The dragon made a furious show of strength; lightening flashed and thunder rolled. The lion leapt and roared. The dragon’s formidable spiritual power and the lion’s frightening might together shook the world and all three lives were cut short. The Heavenly beings esteemed their goodness and none did not praise their humaneness. The two bodhisattvas perished but were born in the Fourth Heaven [5]. The entire kingdom was saved; people embraced the corpses and mournfully cried out, “These men were certainly divine!  Who else is exhibits humaneness such as this?”
Their disciples were looking for them, and they saw that their teachers’ universal kindness had made them sacrifice their bodies to save the living beings. Grief stricken, they proclaimed their virtue. Then each of them pressed forward proclaiming their teachers’ way and making conversions. The ruler, his ministers and the people began to understand the Buddha, and everyone within the boundaries of the kingdom said, “The Buddha’s humane teachings have caused these men to go to such lengths to save us!”
They held funeral rites and buried the two corpses and the entire kingdom was grief-stricken. The King then issued a decree: “Anyone who does not revere the Buddha’s Six Paramitās and Ten Good Behaviours, and who serves the wicked demons, will be punished together with all his relations.”
Henceforth, temples had several thousand śramaṇas standing shoulder to shoulder.
Within the kingdom men and women both became lay followers and maintained lofty conduct. Within the borders the kingdom was tranquil, ushering in an era of Great Peace [6].
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus, “At that time the elder brother was me, and the younger brother was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒). The poisonous dragon was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達 ).”

His attention was always concentrated on impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self. When sitting still he was contemplating, when on the move he was teaching. He sympathised with the ignorant, loved the wise, and was unflaggingly zealous in his intelligent instruction.
He came across a friend from a former existence who had been born in a woman’s body and was a wife in a wealthy family. Confused by her wealth and beauty she was unaware of impermanence. She lived by the market where she ran a business. Śakra transformed into a merchant and pretending he wanted to do business, he approached the woman. She was delighted and ordered her son to rush home to get a stool for the merchant to sit on. The merchant then stared at the woman and started to laugh. The woman maintained high standards of conduct and thought it strange and somewhat inappropriate that this merchant was laughing uncontrollably. Her son was slow bringing the stool, and when he finally returned, she promptly smacked him. This set off the merchant laughing uncontrollably once again. Nearby there was another child jumping and playing, shaking a hand-drum. The merchant laughed at him too. There was someone whose father was sick and he was about to sacrifice an ox to propitiate the demon causing the illness. The merchant laughed at him too. There was a woman wandering across the marketplace cradling a child, and the child scratched her cheek so badly blood that poured down her neck. The merchant laughed at them too. Consequently, the wealthy man’s wife asked, “Sir, you have been standing before me laughing incessantly. If I hit my child it was because of you! Why are you laughing?”
The merchant said, “You and I are old friends, have you forgotten me?”
The woman looked upset and became increasingly discomfited, thinking the merchant words strange. The merchant continued, “The reason I laughed when you smacked your son is that your son is your father whose soul moved on and became your son. Within just one generation you don’t recognise your own father; how much less so will you recognise someone from a long time ago? The boy waving the hand-drum was originally an ox. When the ox died his soul returned and became his master’s son, and the family used the oxen’s skin to cover this drum. Now the boy plays leaping around and dances, not realising that this skin came from his old body. That’s why I was laughing at him. The man sacrificing the ox in a plea to save the life of his sick father was seeking life from death, and that is extremely inauspicious, like administering the poison of the Zhen bird [1] to relieve sickness. His father is about to die and when he does he will be reborn as an ox and generation after generation he will be butchered and suffer misfortunes without end. But the sacrificial ox, upon death will have his spirit will return, and receive human form and he will avoid misfortune and suffering. The child who scratched his mother’s face was originally a concubine when his mother was the principal wife. The mother was obsessed with sex and very jealous of the concubine whom she often cruelly maltreated. The concubine nursed feelings of resentment and hatred and when she died was born as the principal wife’s child, still harbouring desire for revenge, clawed her face and injured her body. Because she does not dare show any resentment towards the child, I laughed at them. Now the minds of living beings lack continuity; past hatred can become love in the present. In all these cases, within a generation someone saw a person [who had been close to them yet] who failed to recognise them. How much more likely will this be after many kalpas have past? The scriptures say, ‘Those who are obstructed by form are blind to the Great Way; those who only listen to evil voices will not hear even the echo of the Buddha’s words.’ That’s the reason I was laughing at all of this. Worldly honour is like lightning – it’s gone in a flash! Awaken to impermanence and do not side with the ignorant! Hold the practice of virtue in high esteem and hold to the marvellous practice of the Six Paramitās. I am now returning home, but I will certainly visit you again in the future.”
Having finished speaking he suddenly disappeared. The woman was full of regret. She went home, fasted and adopted a respectful attitude. The entire kingdom heard what had happened, and there were none among the King and his officials who were not filled with respect. As expected, the merchant turned up at her door. He looked repulsive, dressed in rags, and said, “My friend lives here, call her to come out.”
The gatekeeper went in and reported the situation and the woman emerged and said, “You are no friend of mine!”
Śakra laughed and said, “I look different and I have changed my clothes so you do not recognise me. How much less will you be able to recognise me in a different era when you have given up this earthly form and received another?”
He continued, “Diligently follow the Buddha! It is difficult to encounter a time when there is a buddha, and difficult to have to the opportunity to serve bhikṣus of good conduct, life passes in the time it takes to take a breath – don’t follow the confusion of the era!”
When he had finished speaking, he disappeared. The entire kingdom sighed in appreciation and each person upheld the great marvellous conduct of the Six Paramitās.
  The Buddha told Śāriputra (Qiuluzi 鶖鷺子),
“At that time the woman was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒), and I was Śakra.”
  The Bodhisattva’s determined, limitless practice of zeal is like this.

"《六度集經》卷6：「（七二）女人求願經「昔者菩薩，身為女人，厥婿稟氣兇愚妬忌，每出商行，以妻[3]囑隣獨母，母奉佛戒為清信行。時佛入國，王逮臣民靡不受戒，獨母聞經，還為婦說之。婦喜歎曰：『斯即無上正真道、最正覺者也。』從母聞佛，即遙稽首。齋日母曰：『可往聽[4]化乎？』婦喜曰：『可。』尋之城外，忽存婿妬，悵然不悅，旋居自鄙：『吾殃重乎？』母還為陳：『天龍鬼神、帝王臣民聽經，或得沙門四道者，或受菩薩決者。佛時難值，經法難聞，爾還為乎？』婦聞佛德，流淚具陳婿妬之意。母曰：『可試一行。』婦曰：『敬諾。』明日即隨母行覩佛，五體投地却立靜心，視佛相好念佛清淨真是天尊。佛問女：『爾來何願？』即稽首而對：『我聞佛為無上正真[5]道、最正覺、道法御、天人師，德如恒沙，智若虛空，六通四達得一切智，勢來請尊，願佛哀我。』世尊告曰：『佛為一切護，恣汝所願。』女人稽首曰：『夫人處世未獲本無者，皆以欲故為匹偶居，令我世世與至德偶居，同志無[6]嫉妬行。二曰，身口意行端正絕世。三曰，世世虔奉三尊，心垢日消，進道無倦，諸佛祐助，眾邪不能遏，[7]必獲一切智，濟眾生難。』眾祐歎曰：『善哉，善哉！令汝得之。』婦大歡喜稽首，退歸本居。厥婿賈還，乘舟水行，當以斯日至。天帝覩婦高行，發願無雙，助喜歎善，為興風[8]雨，住其舟行明日乃臻。「婦後壽終，神生有道之家，容華光世，年長出[9]適為國儒士之妻，國稱高賢。時，婿入海採寶欲濟窮民，婦居家以禮自衛，猶城衛寇，國王后妃大臣妻妾靡不仰則，詣門雲集稟婦德儀。婦夜寐覺，憶世無常：『榮富猶幻孰獲長存，躬為坏舟我神載之，猶獲月影望天寶者也。勞心苦身何益於己？夢幻皆空，天神世榮其歸若茲矣。明晨當索無上正真、天中之天為吾師焉。』晨興即覩石塔在庭，佛像金耀，琢[10]壁書經，歎佛為眾聖之師三界[11]獨步。婦喜歎曰：『是則如來、應儀、正真[＊]道、最正覺者乎！』即五體投地遶廟三匝，散華燒香，然燈懸繒，晨夜肅虔，稽首恭禮。王后國婦[12]請承清風[13]退邪崇真。隣有兇夫賈逢婦婿，曰：『子妻造妖，虛立鬼廟，朝暮香熏[14]呪咀妖蠱，願令爾喪，不祥之甚。』婿歸，婦啟曰：『妾前一夜覺世無常，晨覩宗靈，無上正真絕妙之像來在中庭，妾今供事，燒香然燈，懸繒奉華，朝夕禮拜，稽首自歸，子當事之，必合聖則。』婿大歡喜，一心肅虔，國人巨細僉然承風，如是八萬四千餘歲。」佛告鶖鷺子：「爾時婦人者，吾身是也。時婿者，彌勒是也，獨母者，鶖鷺子是也。隣兇夫者，調達是也。菩薩銳志度無極精進如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, p. 38a10-c3)[3] 囑【大】，屬【宋】【元】【明】　[4] 化【大】，法【宋】【元】【明】　[5] 道【大】＊，〔－〕【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[6] 嫉妬【大】，妬嫉【宋】【元】【明】　[7] 必【大】，心【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 雨【大】，雲【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 適【CB】【宋】【元】【明】，嫡【大】(cf.

Each time he went away on business he entrusted his wife to a neighbouring widow. This widow followed the Buddha’s rules and practiced as a lay Buddhist.  At that time, a buddha entered the kingdom and the ruler, his ministers and peoples, all accepted the precepts. The widow heard the scriptures and when she returned home she explained them to the woman who was delighted and said, “This person has attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening!”
Having heard of the Buddha from this widow she bowed her head in respect from afar. One fast day the widow said, “Why don’t we go and hear these transformative teachings?”
The woman joyfully assented.
They went to look for the Buddha outside the city walls, but the woman suddenly recalled her husband’s jealous nature so, disappointed and unhappy, she turned around and went home reproaching herself saying, “Why am I so unfortunate?”
When the widow returned, she told her what had happened: “Heavenly beings, dragons, ghosts and spirits, monarchs and their subjects who listened to the scriptures, some took the Four Paths of the śramaṇa [1], and others received predictions that they would become bodhisattvas. To encounter the time of a buddha is difficult, the scriptures are difficult to hear. Why did you go home?”
When the woman heard of the Buddha’s virtue, tears flowed as she explained her husband’s jealous ways. The widow said, “You could try going out once.”
The woman said, “I will do as you suggest.”
The next day she went with the widow to see the Buddha. She threw herself to the ground in prostration and immediately stood up her mind at ease. She saw the Buddha’s excellent marks and reflecting on the Buddha’s purity realised that in truth he was one honoured by the Gods. The Buddha asked the woman, “Why have you come here?”
She bowed her head to the ground and replied, “I heard the Buddha has attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening, a Charioteer of the Dharma, a Teacher of Gods and Men, with virtues as numerous as the sands in the Ganges, and knowledge as vast as space having obtained omniscience being in possession of the Six Supernatural Penetrations and the Four Unimpeded Discernments, so I took the opportunity to come and ask something of the Venerable One, hoping the Buddha will take pity on me.”
The World Honoured One said, “The Buddha protects all, I will grant your desires.”
The woman bowed her head to the ground, “Women in the world who have not yet obtained original non-being, must all live with a spouse because of desire. Grant first that I, in life after life, will live with a partner of consummate virtue, being of the same mind as myself, devoid of jealousy. Second, let the deeds of my body, mouth and mind be uniquely upright. Third, grant me that in life after life I will be able to devoutly serve the Three Honoured Ones, that the impurities of my mind will diminish daily as I advance along the Way tirelessly with the support of the Buddhas, evil forces being unable to obstruct me, and that I attain omniscience and so save living beings from difficulty.”
The Blessed One sighed and said, “Excellent! Excellent! I will grant these desires!”
The woman was delighted and bowed her head in respect and returned home. Her husband had been on his way home from his business trip by boat, due to arrive on this very day. The King of the Gods Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋) saw this woman’s lofty conduct, and her unrivalled vows, and praising her goodness, assisted in her happiness. On her behalf he raised winds and rains that delayed the boat’s arrival until the following day. Later the woman reached the end of her life, and her spirit was born as the daughter of a household who followed the Way. Her beauty lit up the world. When she came of age, she was married into the family of a scholar respected throughout the kingdom, praised by all for his lofty virtue. At that time, her husband went to sea to gather precious things wanting to save poor people. The woman stayed at home and carried out rites to protect herself, which were as effective as city walls are for protecting against brigands. The wives and concubines of the ruler of the kingdom, as well as the wives of senior officials all looked up to her as a model and went to her door in droves to be instructed by the woman on the principles of virtue. The woman woke up one night and thought about the impermanence of the world: “Honour and wealth are like an illusion; who can hold on to them long term? The body is like a leaky boat in which my soul is conveyed; to maintain it is like trying to grab a moon-shadow or hoping to obtain heavenly treasure. Of what benefit are the troubles of mind and the suffering of the body to oneself? Dreams are all empty, heavenly spirits and those with worldly honour are just like this too. Tomorrow morning, I must search for the God among Gods, who has attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening to be my teacher.”
When she got up in the morning, she saw a stone stūpa in her courtyard. Within it was a Buddha image of brilliant gold, and some Buddhist scriptures had been carved into its wall which praised the Buddha as the teacher of all the sages who walks alone in the Three Realms. The woman was delighted and exclaimed in delight, “This is the Thus-Come-One, the One Deserving of Respect, One of Supreme, Perfect Awakening!”
She prostrated herself on the ground then circumambulated the shrine three times. She scattered flowers and burned incense, lit lamps and hung silk banners. Morning and night, she was solemn and sincere as she bowed her head in respect and devotion. The queen and the wives of high officials asked to receive the pure winds [of the Buddha’s teachings, eager to] resile from the wicked and exalt the True.
The neighbourhood had an evil merchant who encountered the woman’s husband while on business, and he said to him, “Your wife has been bewitched and has erected a shrine to a demon where she burns incense morning and evening and pronounces incantations to demons. She wants to cause you harm – it is extremely inauspicious.”
The husband returned and his wife told him, “One night I became aware of the world’s impermanence and in the morning a numinous shrine had appeared in our courtyard containing an amazing image of the one who has attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening. I now make offerings to him, burning incense and lighting lamps, hanging silk banners, offering flowers and worshiping him day and night. I bow down and devote myself to him. You should serve him – this will certainly accord with the sagely norms.”
The husband was delighted, and with all his heart was solemn and sincere. The people of the kingdom of high rank and low all accepted the teachings. It was like this for more than eighty-four thousand years.
  The Buddha told Śāriputra (Qiuluzi 鶖鷺子):
 “At that time, the woman was me. At the time the husband was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒), the widow was Śāriputra, and the wicked neighbour was Devadatta (Diaoda 調達).”
  The Bodhisattva’s determined, limitless practice of zeal is like this.

Widowed young, she did not remarry, but devoted her life to the Three Respecteds. She lived in poverty delighting in the Way, untiring in her zeal. She avoided all wicked forms of making a profit and sold oil to make a living. At this time there was a śramaṇa in the twilight of his life who while focused on lofty conduct had no time to pursue book learning. Base types said he was ignorant and failed to pay him the proper respect and none of them went to visit. The sesame oil he received on his begging round he offered in lamps in front of the Buddha. The widow knew this and offered him oil never missing a day. There was another monastic who bowed his head in front of the Buddha and joined his hands and asked, “This aged monastic although of scant intelligence adheres to all the precepts and his conduct is lofty. If he lights a lamp in offering to you what good fortune will he obtain later?”
The World Honoured One sighed and said, “What an excellent question! This aged monastic after uncountable kalpas will become a Thus-Come-One, One Free from Attachment, One who has attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening. Around the nape of his neck will be the layered light of the sun and moon, and he will guide the Three Realms. Innumerable living beings will be saved.”
The widow heard this and quickly approached the Buddha and bowed her head before him and said, “The monastic lit a lamp with oil that I donated. When you said that he would attain the Way of the Unsurpassed, Right, and True Enlightenment and that he will lead living beings and return their souls to original non-being, all the Heavenly beings, men, ghosts and dragons were incredibly happy. All I wish for is that you extend your compassion and also confer a prediction on me.”
The Buddha told the woman, “You cannot attain Buddhahood in a woman’s body, nor take the path of one who Awakens to Causation Alone (pratyekabuddha). Neither are the most lofty positions of respect, Brahma, Śakra, Māra, or a Flying Emperor (cakravartin), something one in a female body can attain. If you aspire to attain these positions you must cast aside this defiled form and receive a pure body.”
The woman bowed her head in respect and said, “Then now I must cast it aside.”
She returned home and purified herself by bathing and from afar made obeisance saying, “This body is made up of the Four Elements, it is not something I can protect long term.”
She ascended a tower and made a vow, “I donate my current defiled body to assist hungry and thirsty beings. I beg to attain a male body and receive a prediction of Buddhahood. If there are living beings in this murky world who, blind, have turned their back on the straight and veered towards the crooked, knowing nothing of the Buddha, I want to save them in this world.”
She then threw herself down from this height, and those who observed were chilled with dread and shuddered in horror. The Buddha understood her perfect intent and used magic to cause the ground to become soft like a divine net.  She saw her body was unharmed and had changed into that of a man. She was immeasurably happy, and swiftly went to the Buddha, leaping with joy. She said, “I have received great kindness from the World Honoured One and have already obtained a pure body. All I wish for is that you extend your compassion and confer a prediction of honoured status on me.”
The Buddha praised her saying, “Your courage is such rarely seen in this world, you will certainly attain buddhahood - harbour no doubts! When the monastic who lit the lamps achieves buddhahood he will bestow on you the name you will have when a Buddha.”
Heavenly beings, men, ghosts and dragons hearing she would attain Buddhahood all turned to her to pay their respects and offer congratulations. They returned home and related these events. Everyone praised her and redoubled their efforts to progress along the Buddhist Way. At that time, the numbers of those exhorted to commence Buddhist practice could not even be guessed at.
  The Buddha told Śāriputra (Shiluzi 鶖鷺子):
 “At that time the bhikṣu was Dīpaṃkara Buddha (Dingguang Fo 錠光佛). The widow was me.”
  The Bodhisattva’s determined, limitless practice of zeal is like this."
"《六度集經》卷7：「（八一）眾祐自說，為菩薩時，名曰常悲。常悲菩薩，常流淚且行。時世無佛，經典悉盡，不覩沙門賢聖之眾，常思覩佛聞經妙旨。時世穢濁，背正向邪，華偽趣利猶蛾之樂火；四等六度永康之宅，而世廢佛斯法，就彼危禍，以自破碎也，故為愁荒哀慟且行。往昔有佛名影法無穢如來王，滅度來久，經法都盡。常悲菩薩，夢見其佛為其說法云：「慎無貢高，學士之行，去心恩愛之垢，無著六情之塵勞，無遺眾愛毛髮之大。藏爾心內，諸念寂滅是為無為。」菩薩從佛聞斯法，猶餓夫得甘食，其喜無量，心垢除，入淨定。即棄家捐妻子，入深山處閑寂，以山水果蓏自供，處山舉手椎心哀號而云：「吾生怨乎！不值佛世，不聞佛經，十方現在至真世尊，洞視徹聽，皆一切知，恍惚[4]髣髴，[5]暉靡[6]不之，願現尊靈，令吾覩佛，得聞弘[7]摸大道極趣。」哀聲適訖，天神下曰：「明士乃爾，莫復哀號，佛有大法，名明度無極之明。過去諸佛，今現在、甫當來，皆由斯成，爾必索之誦習其文，懷識其義奉而行之，爾必得四無所畏、十種力、十八不共。身色紫金，項光無際。十方經道，爾為明主，眾聖之尊、天人之師，應儀[8]各佛所無有也。」常悲菩薩仰視報曰：「當由誰聞斯尊法乎？以何方便之何國土？厥師族名？」天人報曰：「爾自斯正東行，無念色痛想行識，無念苦樂善惡、耳目鼻口身心吾我，及人往世所更、來世之事，無念地水火風空，青黃白黑都及眾色，貪淫瞋恚，愚癡嫉妬，男女九族，左右前後高下遲疾。無念有佛無佛、有經道無經道、有賢聖無賢聖，空爾意、絕眾願。爾之執心無違吾教，今覩明度無極聖典。」常悲菩薩仰曰：「敬諾，終始戢之。」天人重曰：「精進存之。」言竟忽然不現。菩薩受教，端心內淨，東行索之。數日即止，深自思曰：「吾宿薄祐，生不值佛，世無沙門，君臣憒憒，無知佛者。明度無極、除冥尊師，去斯幾里，未覩之頃。」心中悲猛，舉哀而行，精誠之至感於諸佛。上方佛來，飛在其前，身色紫金，相好絕聖，面若滿月，項有日光，諸天翼從，寶帳華蓋，作樂散華，叉手垂首。佛歎菩薩曰：「善哉善哉！爾之快健，覩世希有。」菩薩見佛，且喜且悲，稽首而曰：「願佛哀[9]我，斷我繫、解吾結、開吾盲、愈吾病，為吾說經。」佛告之曰：「三界皆空，夫有悉無，萬物若幻，一生一滅，猶若水泡，覩世皆然。爾其思之，吾為爾說經，端心諦聽，慎無忘也。自是東行二萬里，有國名揵陀越，諸菩薩城也，一國之內皆是上士無凡庸人，欲為說諸菩薩之德，劫數已盡，其德有餘。至尊上德菩薩名法來，於彼諸聖猶星有月，懷諸經典，其明無限，敷演明度無極之經，反覆教人，諸菩薩有受經者、誦者、書者、定經[10]原者，爾往見焉，必為爾師。勸爾索佛，疾馳就之，自當為爾說內外明度無極[11]景德。」常悲菩薩聞佛歎彼菩薩名德，心入法喜，得現在定，眾想都寂，悉覩諸佛為己說明度無極之德，歎己精進索佛之勳，僉曰：「善哉！求佛之志爾為得之。吾於往昔始發意時亦皆然也。已逝、甫來、現在諸佛，皆如爾索矣。爾必得佛，濟一切生也。」常悲菩薩從定寤，左右顧視不復[A5]覩諸佛，即復心悲流淚且云：「諸佛靈耀自何所來？今逝焉如？」菩薩禪度無極一心如是。」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, p. 43a13-c20)[4] 髣髴【大】，髮鬚【宋】，髣髴耀【元】【明】　[5] 暉【大】，輝【宋】【元】【明】　[6] 不【大】，乏【宋】，不了【元】【明】　[7] 摸【大】，廣【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 各【大】，名【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 我【大】，哉【宋】【元】【明】　[10] 原【大】，源【宋】【元】【明】　[11] 景【大】，影【宋】　[A5] 覩【CB】【麗-CB】，視【大】(cf. K11n0206_p0344b15)","The Blessed One explained this himself: once I was a bodhisattva called Always-Sad (Changbei 常悲). Bodhisattva Always-Sad wept incessantly as he as he walked along; at that time there was no buddha in the world, the scriptures had all disappeared, and the community of the Wise Sages, the śramaṇas, was not to be seen. He constantly yearned to see a buddha and to hear the scriptures’ profound meaning. At that time the world was contaminated - its inhabitants had turned their backs on the correct to face the wicked. In their ostentatious fakery they pursued profit as a moth delights in a flame. The Four Equalities [1] and the Six Paramitās are an abode of eternal peace, yet the world’s inhabitants had discarded this Law of the Buddhas (dharma) and this had led to calamity; they were the authors of their own misfortune. This is why he was overcome with sadness and grief as he walked. In former times there had been buddha by the name of His Highness, the Thus Come Reflecting the Law Without Stain (影法無穢如來王). He passed over a very long time ago and his teachings had all disappeared. Bodhisattva Always-Sad had a dream in which he saw this buddha who preached the law for him saying, “Take care not to adopt the self-satisfied conduct of the scholar and banish from your mind the filth of affection. Do not cling to the worldly worries of the Six Senses, do not overlook even a hair-thin attachment! All thoughts should be quietened and destroyed; this is to put non-action into practice.”
 When the Bodhisattva heard this teaching from the Buddha it was as if a starving man had been given sweet food; his joy knew no bounds, his mind’s filth was eliminated, and he entered pure state of concentration. He promptly left his family, casting aside his wife and children and entering deep into the mountains found a secluded and quiet spot where he sustained himself with mountain waters and fruits. While living in the mountains he would raise his hands and beating his chest, lamenting, “My life is hateful! I did not encounter the era when there was a buddha, and I do not get to hear the buddhhist scriptures. Are there any throughout the Ten Directions who have reached the status of an ultimately perfected World Honoured One, whose mind is pure and contemplation clear, who has omniscience like a flash which illuminates everything? Manifest your respected spirit and allow me to see a buddha and to hear the wide-ranging model of the Great Way so I can make the utmost efforts to pursue it.”
No sooner had his lamentations ceased, than a heavenly deity descended and said,
“Wise man, lament like this no more! The Buddha has the Great Law called the brightness of Unsurpassed Wisdom (prajñāpāramitā). All the buddhas of the past, of the present, and of the future all came, or will come, into being through this. You must seek it out and recite and study its texts, embody and understand its import, uphold and practice it. In doing so you will certainly attain the Four Forms of Fearlessness, the Ten Supernatural Powers, and the Eighteen Unique Merits of a Buddha, a body of purple gold and a boundless glow round your neck. You will be the wise master of the scriptures of the Way throughout the Ten Directions, respected among the assembly of the sages, a Teacher of Gods and Men. Even those Worthy of Respect and Individual Buddhas do not have these qualities.”
Bodhisattva Always-Sad looked up and replied, “From whom will I get to hear this respected Law? By what means? To which kingdom shall I go? What is this teacher’s name?”
The heavenly being replied, “From this place go due east. Do not think of the Five Aggregates of form, feeling, perception, impulse, and consciousness; do not think of suffering, joy, good and bad, of what relates to the ear, eye, nose, mouth, body, mind, self, and others, nor what has happened in the past, nor what will happen in the future; do not think of earth, water, fire, wind and space, or blue, yellow, white, black, or any other colour, or of greed, anger, stupidity or envy, or of any of your relations male and female, or of left or right, front or behind, above or below, fast or slow. Do not think of whether there is a buddha or not, of whether there are scriptures of the Way or not, of whether there are Wise Sages or not. Empty your thoughts, cut off all desires, and if your steadfast mind does not violate my teachings you will now see the sagely scriptures of Unsurpassed Wisdom.”
Bodhisattva Always-Sad looked up and said, “I will do as you say. I will relinquish them from now on.”
The heavenly being spoke again, “Zealously keep this in mind!”
Once he had spoken, suddenly he was no more to be seen. The Bodhisattva having received these instructions, rectified his mind, purified himself, and set out east in search of this Buddha, after several days he suddenly stopped and thought deeply to himself: “My previous lives have had scant blessings, born when I could not encounter a buddha, in a world without śramaṇas, when rulers and vassals alike were confused and knew nothing of the Buddha. How far away lies the Unsurpassed Wisdom, that teacher who will dispel the darkness? How long before I understand?”
 Before he saw a buddha his mind became fiercely sad and he lamented as he progressed. This utmost sincerity moved the buddhas and a buddha came down from on high and flew in front of him, his body of purple gold, his outstanding sageliness evident in his distinguishing marks, his face like the full moon, the light of the sun round the nape of his neck. Heavenly beings formed his retinue holding up bejewelled curtains and splendid canopies, playing music and scattering flowers, joining hands and bowing their heads. The Buddha praised the Bodhisattva, saying “Excellent! Excellent! Such bold vigour as yours is rarely seen in the world.”
The Bodhisattva saw the Buddha and felt happiness and sadness simultaneously, he touched his head to the ground and said, “I beg the Buddha take pity on me and preach the Law for me, so I can sever my ties, undo my binds, dispel my blindness, and cure my ills.”
  The Buddha told him, “The Three Realms are empty, being is non-being. The ten thousand things are like an illusion, no sooner is something born than it disappears, like froth on water. Observe! All the world is the same. Think on this! I have explained the scriptures for you. Concentrate your mind, listen attentively, and take care not to forget. Twelve-hundred miles east here there is a kingdom called Gandhavatī (Qiantuoyue 揵陀越), it is the city of the Bodhisattvas. The entire kingdom’s inhabitants are all superior men, no ordinary people abide there. If I were to speak to you of the virtues of these bodhisattvas for several kalpas there would still be more to tell. The most respected, the bodhisattva of the highest virtue is called Law-Arrives (Falai 法來, Dharmodgata). Among all the sages he is like the moon among the stars. He has embraced the scriptures and his wisdom is limitless. He expounds the scriptures of the Unsurpassed Wisdom and repeatedly instructs people. The bodhisattvas who have accepted these teachings, recite them, copy them, and concentrate on the scriptures’ origins. Go to see him, he must become your teacher and will urge you to seek buddhahood. Swiftly go to him and he will preach for you the inner and outer aspects of the Unsurpassed Wisdom.”
Bodhisattva Always-Sad listened to the Buddha praise this bodhisattva’s renowned virtue, and his mind experienced the joy of the Law and he attained the contemplation of the buddhas of the present. All his thoughts were stilled and he was able to see buddhas in great detail who explicated the virtues of the Unsurpassed Wisdom for him and praised the merit gained from his zealous pursuit of buddhahood. They all said, “Excellent! Because of your resolve in seeking buddhahood you will attain it. In the past when we first made our vow it was just like this. The buddhas of the past, future and present all sought buddhahood as you do. You will certainly attain buddhahood and save all beings.”
Bodhisattva Always-Sad emerged from meditation and looked around him, but no longer saw any buddhas. Once again, his heart was grieved and tears flowed and he said, “Where did the radiance of the buddhas come from? And where has it gone?”
  The Bodhisattva’s dhyāna pāramitā concentrates the mind like this.
Notes:
[1] The Four Equalities (si deng 四等) or Four Equal States of Mind (si deng xin 四等心) are the apramānas, four states of mind a Buddha manifests to all, later translated as the Four Immeasurable States of Mind (si wuliang xin 四無量心). They are loving-kindness (maitrī; ci 慈), compassion (karuṇā; bei 悲), sympathetic joy (muditā; xi 喜), and equanimity (upekṣā; she 捨)."
"《六度集經》卷7：「（八二）「昔有兩菩薩，志清行淨，內寂無欲，表如天金，去穢濁之群，處山澤，鑿石為室。閑居[12]靖志，菅衣草席，食果飲泉，清淨無為，志若虛空，四禪備悉，得五通智：一能徹視無遐不覩，二能洞聽無微不聞，三能騰飛出入無間，四能通知十方眾生心中所念，五能自知無數劫來宿命所更。梵釋仙聖，諸天龍鬼，靡不稽首。處山澤六十餘年，悲念眾生展轉愚冥，不覩為惡後有重殃，約情棄欲敬奉三尊，福至響應必獲其榮。二梵志者：一名題耆羅，二名那賴。題耆夜興誦經，疲極臥出，那賴時亦誦經，誤蹈題耆羅首，題耆即興而曰：『誰蹈吾首者，明旦日出一[1]竿，破爾之首為七分善乎！』那賴曰：『誤蹈爾[2]耳，祝誓何重？[A6]瓦器不行之類，尚有相觸，豈況於人共處，終年而不誤失乎？爾言常誠，明旦日出，吾首必為七分矣。吾當制日不令其出。』遂爾不出。五日之間，舉國幽冥，炬燭相尋，眾官不修，君民惶惑，會群寮、請道士。王曰：『日之不出，其咎安在？』道士之中有五通者曰：『山中道士，兩有微諍，故制日令不出耳。』王曰：『其諍有緣乎？』道士具以本[3]未為王說之。王曰：『奈之何？』答曰：『王率群寮民無巨細，馳詣于彼稽首和解，彼必慈和。』王即有詔如道士令，詣于山澤叩頭曰：『國豐民寧，二尊之潤，而今不和，率土失所。其咎在我，黎民無過，願赦之。』那賴曰：『王勤曉彼意，彼意解者、吾放日矣。』王之題耆羅所，宣那賴旨。王即曰：『令彼以泥塗其首放日。』泥首即破為七分，那賴無為。王臣黎民靡不欣懌，兩道士為王廣陳治國，當以四等無蓋之慈，勸奉五戒載十善而行。王及臣民，僉然受戒。王還國有詔曰：『人無尊卑，帶五戒十善經，以為[4]國政。』自斯之後，王潤逮草木，忠臣誠且清讓，父法母儀室家各尚，守道貞信，家有孝子。眾祐曰：『兩菩薩覩其國主不知三尊，臣民憒憒邪見自蔽，猶冥中閉目行。愍其[5]徒死不覩佛經，故為斯變，欲其覩明也。』」佛告諸比丘：「那賴者，吾身是。題耆羅者，彌勒是。菩薩禪度無極一心如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 43c21-44b4)[12] 靖【大】，靜【宋】【元】【明】　[1] 竿【大】，丈【宋】　[2] 耳【大】，首【宋】【元】【明】　[A6] 瓦【CB】【麗-CB】，凡【大】(cf.

Within, tranquil without desires, without, like heavenly gold; they had dispelled the multitude of defilements. They settled in the mountain wilderness where they had carved a cave from the living rock to serve as their abode. They led lives of reclusion and quiet resolve. Rough grasses clothed them and straw became their mats; they ate fruits and drank spring water. Pure in their non-action, their resolve was as expansive as space. Having mastered the Fourth Dhyāna they had attained the Five Supernatural Penetrations: the first is the ability to see unobstructed, everything can be seen however distant; the second is the ability to hear acutely, everything can be heard however faint; the third is the ability fly swiftly, to come and go even where there is no gap; the fourth is the ability to thoroughly understand the thoughts in the minds of sentient beings of the ten directions; and the fifth is the ability to know the details of ones’ past lives experienced throughout innumerable kalpas. Śakra (Shi 釋) and Brahma (Fan 梵) and the immortals and sages, all the heavenly beings, dragons and ghosts, none did not bow their heads to the ground in respect. They resided in the mountain wilderness for more than sixty years and thought sadly about sentient beings cycling through ignorant darkness, not understanding that doing evil will later bring about serious calamity; nor that if they constrained emotion, discarded desire and respectfully esteemed the Three Respecteds, then good fortune would respond like an echo and they would certainly flourish. These two brahmins were one named Tiqiluo (題耆羅), the other named Nalai (那賴). Tiqi rose to chant the scriptures one night but was so tired he fell asleep. At the same time, Nalai was also chanting scriptures and accidentally trod on Tiqiluo’s head. Tiqi leapt up and said, “Who trod on my head? Tomorrow at the crack of dawn I’m going to smash your head into seven pieces, alright?”
Nalai said, “I trod on you by accident, why vow such a heavy punishment? Even inanimate objects collide sometimes, how much more so will people who live together? Who doesn’t make a mistake over the course of their lives? You are always sincere in your pronouncements: if the sun rises in the morning, my head will certainly be split into seven, so I will ensure the sun does not rise!”
And so, the sun did not rise and for five days. The entire kingdom was in darkness. People found their way using torches, the various officials were unable to govern and both the ruler and his people were fearful and confused. Officials were summoned and ascetics were invited. The King asked, “Where lies the blame for the sun’s failure to come out?”
Among the ascetics there was one in possession of the Five Supernatural Penetrations and he said, “Among the ascetics in the mountains there are two who have had a trivial dispute and so one is controlling the sun and not permitting it to rise.”
The King asked, “What is the cause of their dispute?”
The ascetics explained to the king what had happened from start to finish. The King said, “How are we to deal with this?”
They replied, “Your Majesty, lead your officials and people, regardless of status, and pay them a visit very soon, bow before them and attempt to reconcile them. Out of compassion they will certainly make up.”
The King promptly issued orders in accordance with the ascetics’ suggestions and went to the mountain wilderness and touching his head to the floor in respect said, “The kingdom’s flourishing and the peoples’ peace was the result of the nourishment provided by you two Respected Ones. But now you have fallen out the entire kingdom has become chaotic. The fault lies with me, the common people have done nothing wrong, please do not punish them!”
Nalai said, “Your Majesty, I urge you to make Tiqilu see the light about his intention, and once this intention has been relinquished, I will release the sun.”
The King approached Tiqiluo and explained Nalai’s position he then said, “I order that he cover his head with mud and release the sun.”
The mud head was then smashed into seven pieces and Nalai took no more action.
The King and his officials were all overjoyed. The two ascetics expansively laid out for the King the principles of how to govern the kingdom well: he must employ the Four Equalities [1] of unbounded compassion. They urged him to uphold the Five Rules and to put into practice the Ten Good Behaviours. The King, his officials and his people all accepted the Buddhist rules.  The King returned to his kingdom and decreed, “All subjects no matter of high status or low will take on the Five Rules and the Ten Good Behaviours, and the scriptures will be used to govern the kingdom.”
From this time on the King’s nourishment reached even the grass and trees, loyal ministers were sincere, and were pure and deprecatory; fathers provided a model and mothers were exemplars and each home was excellent; they defended the Way, were upright and honest and each family had filial children.
The Blessed One said, “These two bodhisattvas saw that this ruler did not know of the Three Honoured Ones, that his officials and people were confused, blind to their own evil outlook like someone wandering around in the dark with their eyes closed. They took pity on those who lived and died in vain having had no opportunity to encounter the Buddha’s scriptures and for this reason they made these changes desiring they see the light.”
The Buddha told the bhikṣus, “Nalai was me. Tiqiluo was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒).”

"《六度集經》卷8：「（八三）聞如是：一時，佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園，與千二百五十比丘俱，菩薩萬人共坐。第一弟子[11]鶖鷺子，前稽首長跪白言：「車匿宿命有何功德？菩薩處家當為飛行皇帝，而勸棄國入山學道，自致為佛，拯濟眾生，功勳巍巍乃至滅度。[12]唯願世尊為現其[13]原。」佛歎曰：「善哉善哉！鶖鷺子所問甚善！車匿累世功勳無量，爾等諦聽，吾將說之。」對曰：「唯然。」佛言：「吾昔為菩薩，在尼呵遍國，其王聞：『人或為道昇天，或為神祠昇天者。』王自童孺來，常願昇天未知所由。國有梵志四萬餘人，王[14]現之曰：『吾欲昇天，將以何方？』耆艾對曰：『善哉問也！王將欲以斯身昇天耶？以魂靈乎？』王曰：『如斯坐欲昇天也。』曰：『當[15]興大祀，可獲之矣。』王喜無量，以金銀二千斤賜之。梵志獲寶歸，快相娛樂，寶盡議曰：『令王取童男童女光華踰眾者各百人，象馬雜畜事各百頭，先飯吾等却殺人畜，以其骨肉為陛昇天。』以事上聞，王曰：『甚善！』[16]王即命[17]外臣疾具如之，悉閉著獄，哭者塞路，國人僉曰『夫為王者，背佛真化，而興妖蠱，喪國[18]之基也。』梵志又曰：『儻殺斯生王不獲昇天，吾等戮[19]尸于市朝，其必也。』重謀曰：『香山之中有[20]天王妓女，名似人形神，[21]神聖難獲，令王求之。若其不致，眾事都息，吾等可無[22]尤矣。』又之王所曰：『香山之中有天樂女，當得其血合于人畜以為階陛，爾乃昇天。』王重喜曰：『不早[A1]陳之，今已四月始有云乎？』對曰：『吾術本末。』王令國內黎庶並會，快大賞賜，酒樂備悉，『[23]今日孰能獲神女乎？』民有知者，曰：『第七山中有兩道士，一名闍犁，一曰優[24]犇。知斯神女之所處也。』王曰：『呼來！』使者奉命，數日即將道士還。王喜設酒為樂七日，曰：『爾等為吾獲神女來，吾其昇天以國惠爾。』對曰：『必自[25]勉勵。』退[26]坐，尋求二月有餘，經七重山乃之香山，覩大池水，縱廣三十里。池邊平地有[27]大寶城，縱廣起高各八十里，寶樹周城[28]曜曜光國，池中蓮華華有千葉，其有五色光光相照，異類之鳥[29]唱和而鳴。城門七重，樓閣宮殿，更相因仍，幢幡[30]韑曄，鍾鈴五音，天帝處中[＊]倡人相娛。七日之後，釋出遊戲，於池沐浴，快樂已畢，當還昇天。池邊樹下有聖梵志，內外無垢，獲五通之明。兩道士進稽首曰：『斯音絕世，將為誰樂？』答曰：『頭[31]魔王女等千餘人，于斯遊戲，方來修[1]虔，爾等早退。』受命退隱，議曰：『斯梵志道德之靈，吾等當以何方致天女乎？[＊]唯當以蠱道結草[2]祝𥜒投之于水，令梵志體重天女靈歇耳。』即結草投水以蠱道[＊]祝。帝釋旋邁，諸天都然，[＊]唯斯天女不獲翻飛，兩道士入水，解其上衣以縛之。女曰：『爾等將以吾為？』答如上說。以竹為[3]箄行道七日，乃之王國。詣宮自懼，王喜[4]現女為之設食，慰勞道士曰：『吾獲昇天，斯國惠爾。』「王之元子名難羅尸，為異國王，厥太子名須羅，先內慈[5]仁，和明照[6]大，初見世眾生未然之事，無窈不覩，無微不達，六度高行不釋于心，自誓求如來、無所著、正真覺、道法御、天人師、善逝、世[7]間，逮[8]於本無。王曰：『吾當昇天，呼皇孫辭。』孫至稽首，[9]受辭畢，退就座。王曰：『爾親逮民安乎？』對曰：『蒙潤[10]普寧。』孫曰：『吾不求天女為妃者，王必殺其[11]儻。』因人以聞。王曰：『吾當以其血為陛昇天。』孫即絕食，退寢不悅。王懼其喪，即以妃焉。內外欣懌，[12]所患都歇。「四月之後，梵志復聞曰：『當為埳殺諸畜生以填埳中，取神女血[13]以塗其上，擇吉日祠天。』王曰：『善哉！』命諸國老群僚黎庶：『當興斯祀。』皇孫聞之，憮然不悅，難梵志曰：『斯祀之術出何聖典[14]乎？』答曰：『夫為斯祀，祚應昇天。』皇孫難曰：『夫殺者害眾生之命，害眾生之命者，逆惡之元首，其禍無際，魂靈轉化，更相[15]慊怨，刃毒相殘世世無休，死入太山，燒煑脯割，諸毒備畢，出或[16]作畜生，死輙更刃；若後為人，有戮尸之咎者，殘[17]殺之所由也。豈有行虐而昇天者乎？』梵志答曰：『爾年[18]東始，智將何逮，而難吾等？』皇孫曰：『吾宿命時，生梵志家連五百世，翫爾道書，清真為首。爾等巧偽，豈合經旨乎？』梵志曰：『子知吾道，奚不陳之？』皇孫具說：『梵志[19]景則，聖趣至清，而爾等穢濁，殘酷貪餮，虛以邪祀殺人眾畜，[20]飲酒婬亂，欺上窮民，令民背佛違法遠賢不宗，盡財供鬼而親飢寒，豈合聖趣沙門之高行乎？』梵志等恧慙，稽首而退。「孫即為祖王，陳無上正真、最正覺至誠之信言：『夫欲昇天者，當歸命三尊，覺四非常，[21]都絕慳貪、[22]殖志清淨，損己濟眾，潤逮眾生，斯一也。慈愍生命，恕己濟彼，志恒止足，非有不取，守貞不泆，信而不[23]欺，酒為亂毒，孝道枯朽，遵奉十德，導親以正，斯二矣。忍眾生辱，悲傷狂醉，毒來哀往，濟而不害，喻以三尊，解即助喜，[24]慈育等護，恩齊二儀，斯三矣。銳志精進，仰登高行，斯四矣。棄邪除垢，志寂若空，斯五矣。博學無蓋，求一切智，斯六矣。懷斯弘德終始無尤，索為三界法王可得，昇天何難？若違佛慈教，崇彼凶酷，殘眾生命，婬樂邪祀，生即天棄，死入三塗，更相[25]彫戮，受禍無窮。以斯[26]元惡，庶望昇天，譬違王命者冀獲高位也。』王曰：『善哉！信矣！』開獄大赦，却絕諸妖，即舉國寶[27]命孫興德。皇孫獲寶[28]都料窮民，布施七日無乏不足。布施之後，勸民持戒，率土感潤，靡不遵承。天龍鬼神，僉然歎善，為雨名寶眾綵諸[29]穀。隣國慕德歸化，猶眾流之[30]歸海也。皇孫將妃辭親而退，還國閉閤廢事相樂，眾臣以聞曰：『不除其妃，國事將朽矣。』父王曰：『祖王妻之，焉得除乎？』召而閉之。妃聞恧然，飛還本居之第七山，覩優犇等告之曰：『吾婿來者為吾送之。留金指鐶為信。』父聞妃去，遣子返國，不覩其妃，悵然流淚。護宮神曰：『爾無悼焉，吾示爾路。妃在第七山，疾尋可及。』皇孫聞之，即服珠衣，帶劒執弓，[31]衣光耀四十里。明日至七山，覩妃折樹枝投地為識，前見兩道士問曰：『吾妃歷茲乎？』曰：『然。』以環付之，翼從俱行。以木為橋，度彼小水，之八山上，覩四禪梵志，五體投地，稽首為禮曰：『覩妃經斯乎？』答曰：『經茲矣。且坐須臾，吾示爾處。』時天王釋化為獼猴，威靈震山，皇孫大懼。梵志曰：『爾無懼也，彼來供養。』獼猴覩三道士，疑住不前。梵志曰：『進。』獼猴即進，以果供養，梵志受之。四人共享，謂獼猴曰：『將斯三人至似人形神所。』曰：『斯何人令之昇天乎？』梵志曰：『國王太子開士之元首[32]者，方為如來、無所著、正真道、最正覺、道法御、天人師，眾生當蒙其澤得[33]還本無。』獼猴歎曰：『善哉！開士得佛，吾乞為馬。』優犇二人，一願為奴，一願為應真。開士曰：『大善！』即俱昇天。道有緣一覺五百人，俱過稽首，遣獼猴還取華散諸佛上，願曰『令吾疾獲為正覺，將導眾生滅生死神[＊]還于本無。』三人又如前願，俱為諸佛稽首而去。「到似人形神城門之外，獼猴稽首而退，三人俱坐。時有青衣出汲水，開士問曰：『爾以水為？』答曰：『給王女浴。』開士脫指[1]環投其水中，天女覩環，即止不浴，啟其親曰：『吾夫相尋，今來在茲。』親名頭[2]摩，喜而疾出，與之相見。開士稽首為婿之禮，兩道士稽首而退。王請入內，手以女授，侍女千餘，天樂相娛。留彼七年，存親生養，言之哽[3]咽，辭退歸國。天王曰：『斯國眾諸，今以付子，而去何為？』開士又辭如前。王曰：『且留七日，盡樂相娛。』七日之後有大神王，詣天王所賀曰：『[4]亡女既歸，又致聖婿。』天王曰：『吾女微賤，獲聖雄之婿，思歸養親，煩為送之。』鬼王敬諾，即以天寶為殿，七層之觀、眾寶天樂世所希覩，鬼王掌奉送著本土，稽首而退。「開士覩親，虔辭備悉，祖王喜而禪位焉。天女鬼龍靡不稱善。大赦眾罪，空國布施，四表黎庶，下逮眾生，濟其窮乏，從心所欲。眾生踊躍靡不咨嗟，歎佛仁化潤過天地，八方慕澤入國，若幼孩之依慈母，祖王壽終即生天上。」佛告鶖鷺子：「皇孫者，[5]我身是。四禪梵志者，[＊]鶖鷺子是。優犇者，今目連是。闍[6]梨者，今車匿是。[7]天帝釋[8]者，揵德是。父王者，迦葉是。祖王者，今白淨王是。母者，吾母舍妙是。妃者，[9]俱夷是。菩薩累載以四等弘慈，六度無極，拯濟眾生，難為籌算。」佛說經竟，諸菩薩四輩弟子，天龍鬼神及質諒神，靡不歡喜，作禮而去。」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 44b12-46b4)[11] 鶖鷺【大】＊，秋露【宋】＊　[12] 唯【大】＊，惟【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[13] 原【大】，源【宋】【元】【明】　[14] 現【大】，視【宋】【元】【明】　[15] 興大祀【大】，與太妃【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 王【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[17] 外臣【大】，臣外【宋】【元】【明】　[18] 之基【大】，人基者【宋】【元】【明】　[19] 尸【大】，屍【宋】【元】【明】　[20] 天【大】，大【元】【明】　[21] 神【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[22] 尤【大】，訧【宋】【元】【明】　[A1] 陳【CB】，陣【大】　[23] 今日【大】，令曰【宋】【元】【明】　[24] 犇【大】，奔【宋】【元】【明】　[25] 勉勵【大】，免迫【宋】【元】【明】　[26] 坐【大】，座【宋】【元】【明】　[27] 大【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[28] 曜曜【大】，耀耀【宋】【元】【明】　[29] 唱【大】＊，倡【宋】＊　[30] 韑【大】，暐【宋】【元】【明】　[＊29-1] 唱【大】＊，倡【宋】＊　[31] 魔【大】，摩【宋】【元】【明】　[1] 虔【大】，處【宋】【元】【明】　[＊12-1] 唯【大】＊，惟【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[2] 祝𥜒【CB】，祝𧞣【大】＊，咒厭【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊，祝𧞣【麗-CB】，咒厭【磧-CB】　[＊12-2] 唯【大】＊，惟【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[3] 箄【CB】【麗-CB】，箅【大】，𥱼【宋】，篳【元】【明】(cf.

  Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國), at his monastery in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu祇樹) among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada with one thousand, two hundred and fifty bhikṣus, and ten thousand bodhisattvas, all sitting together. The foremost disciple, Śāriputra (Quiliuzi 鶖鷺子) advanced and having touched his head to the ground in respect knelt up and addressed the Buddha saying, “What merit did Chandaka (Cheni 車匿) accumulate in his past lives? If the Bodhisattva had remained at home, he would have become a Flying Emperor (cakravartin), yet he was urged to renounce his kingdom and enter the mountains to study the Way and through his own efforts become a buddha. He saved living beings and his towering merit resulted in his extinction and crossing (nirvāṇa). I hope the World Honoured One will reveal Chandaka’s origins.”
The Buddha exclaimed, “Excellent! Excellent! Śāriputra asks a very good question! Chandaka’s merit, accrued over many lives, is immeasurable. Listen attentively all of you and I will explain the circumstances.”
They replied, “We will.”
The Buddha said, “In former times I was a bodhisattva. In the kingdom of Nihebian (尼呵遍國) the ruler had heard that some ascend to the Heavens by practicing the Way and others ascend to the Heavens by offering sacrifices to divinities. Since he was a child this ruler had always aspired to ascend to the Heavens but had not yet worked out how to do so. The kingdom had more than forty thousand brahmins and the ruler held an audience with them and said, “I want to ascend to the Heavens. What method should I employ?”
An elder replied, “An excellent question! Does Your Majesty desire to make a bodily ascent to the Heavens or one of the spirit?”
The ruler replied, “I wish to ascend just as I sit here.”
The elder said, “Then you must make the Great Sacrifice and you will obtain what you desire.”
The ruler’s joy knew no bounds and he gave them two thousand pounds of gold and silver. The brahmins took the treasures and returned home sharing their sheer delight. When the valuables had been used up, they discussed the situation saying, “Order the ruler to obtain one hundred boys and the same number of girls, all of outstanding brilliance, and one hundred head of each elephants, horses and diverse types of livestock. Then after he has first treated us to a feast, he can sacrifice these humans and animals, and their flesh and bones will form a stairway to the Heavens.”
This was reported to the ruler who said, “Very good!”
The ruler then ordered the local officials to waste no time in arranging these affairs. The sacrificial victims were all imprisoned, and weeping relatives clogged up the highways, the people of the kingdom all saying, “This ruler has turned his back on the Buddha’s true teachings and promotes wicked sorcery. He is laying the foundation for the ruination of the kingdom!”
The brahmins also said, “If, once these beings have been sacrificed, His Majesty does not ascend to the Heavens, our corpses will end up exposed in the marketplace. No doubt about it!”
They did some more scheming, and said, “On the Fragrant Mountain (Xiangshan 香山) there is one of the King of the Heaven’s dancing girls called Divine Humanesque (Siren xingshen 似人形神). She is sagacious and will be difficult to find. If we tell the ruler he must get hold of her, when he fails, this matter will be put to rest and we won’t get the blame.”
So once again they went to the ruler and said, “On the Fragrant Mountain there is a woman, a heavenly musician. You must obtain some of her blood and mix it with that of the humans and animals to make the flight of steps, then you can ascend to the Heavens.”
The ruler was extremely pleased, but asked, “Why was I was not told this earlier? Four months have passed and this is the first time you have mentioned it.”
They replied, “Our methods follow a particular procedure.”
The ruler ordered the common folk of his kingdom to assemble, and he happily bestowed great gifts on them and entertained them before filling them in on all the details [1], then asking, “Now, who can capture this divine woman?”
In the crowds was a knowledgeable person who said, “In the Seventh Mountains there are two ascetics one named Sheli (闍梨), the other called Youben (優犇). They know where this woman is.”
The ruler cried, “Summon them!”
An emissary was dispatched under orders and after several days he returned with the ascetics. The ruler was delighted and arranged wine for seven days of merrymaking and said, “You are going to capture this divine woman and deliver her to me, and on my ascent to the Heavens I will give my kingdom to you.”
The pair replied, “We will certain do our utmost.”
Then they returned to their seats.
For more than two months they searched, passing over seven layers of mountain ranges before reaching the Fragrant Mountain. There they saw a huge pool ten miles across. On the flats beside the pool there was a great bejewelled city, its breadth and height reaching twenty-five miles. Jewelled trees surrounded the city, their radiance illuminating the kingdom. In the pool there were thousand-petaled lotus flowers, their five-hued brilliance shining forth. Unusual birds sang in harmony. The city had a sequence of seven gates, and buildings and palaces stood one right next to the other, gleaming banners flew and bells large and small rang out in the five notes. Within the King of the God’s abode singers and dancers amused one another. After seven days, the King [Druma (Toumo 頭魔)] [2] came out for some recreation and to bathe in the pool. When the festivities were over, he returned back up to his Heaven. Beside the pool, beneath the trees there was a sagacious brahmin, with no impurities within or without, who had attained the clarity that attends the Five Supernatural Penetrations. The two ascetics approached and touched their heads to the floor in respect and said, “This music is out of this world! By whom is it being played?”
The reply was, “By King Druma’s women - more than one thousand of them. They have been disporting themselves here and are about to come to practice their devotions. You should be gone!”
The pair did as they were bidden and retired to hide. They had a discussion: “This brahmin is possessed of the numinous power bestowed by morality. How are we to get hold of this heavenly woman? We have no option but to resort to sorcery. If we knot some grass and say some incantations over it then toss it into the water, we can cause the body of the heavenly maiden to become heavy and the numinous powers of the brahmin to dissipate.” [3]
They promptly knotted some grass and tossed it into the water having intoned a maleficent incantation over it.The Heavenly King turned and went far away and the heavenly beings all followed, leaving only this heavenly maiden who was unable to fly away. The two ascetics went into the water, removed her outer garment and used it to bind her. The woman said, “What are you going to do with me?”
They answered explaining their plan as outlined above. They made a bamboo cage to transport her and traversed the roads for seven days before arriving at the kingdom of that ruler. When they arrived at the palace she was terrified, but the ruler was delighted. When they showed him the woman he prepared a feast for the ascetics and showered them with gifts, saying, “When I ascend to the Heavens this kingdom will be yours!”
The ruler’s eldest son was called Nanluoshi (難羅尸) and he was the ruler of another kingdom and his crown prince was called Xuluo (須羅). Above all he favoured inner qualities of compassion and kindness. His calm brightness illuminated widely; from the beginning he was able to see the future of living beings and there was no darkness through which his sight did not penetrate, and there was nothing so tiny it escaped his notice. The lofty conduct of the Six Paramitās were never out of his mind and he vowed to himself to seek to become a Thus-come, a Non-Attached, one of the Supreme, Perfect Awakening, a Charioteer of the Dharma, a Teacher of Gods and Men, one Well-Gone, a Knower of the World, and so to reach original non-being.
The ruler said, “I am about to ascend to the Heavens, summon my royal grandson so I can bid him farewell.”
His grandson arrived and bowed his head to the floor and, having accepted his farewells, returned to his seat. The ruler said, “Are your parents and their subjects at peace?”
He replied, “The blessing and benefit of my father’s rule mean all live in tranquillity.”
[He thought to himself,] “If I do not seek to take the Heavenly Maiden as my wife the ruler will certainly kill her kind.” [4]
Someone reported this to the ruler who said, “But I intend to use her blood to create a stairway to ascend to the Heavens.”
His grandson promptly refused to eat and went to his quarters, displeased. The ruler feared he would die and gave her to his grandson in marriage. All within and without the palace were filled with joy that this disaster had been averted.
Four months later, the brahmins once again advised the ruler, “We should dig a pit, kill all the domestic animals,  fill the pit with their corpses, and get the blood of the divine woman and smear it on top of them. Let us select an auspicious day to make the sacrifice to Heavens.”
The ruler said, “Very good!”
He ordered all the elders of the kingdom, the officials and common folk to conduct this sacrifice. When the royal grandson heard what was afoot, he was shocked and saddened and he took issue with the brahmins saying, “What sagely classic contains the formula for the conduct of this sacrifice?”
They replied, “Those who perform this sacrifice will be blessed and will ascend to the Heavens.”
The royal grandson argued with them saying, “This slaughter destroys the lives of living beings and such destruction is the foremost evil and the misfortune which will attend on the perpetrators will be never ending! Their spirits will transform on death and will resent and reproach one another, stabbing and poisoning one other with savagery life after life without respite. Or on death they will enter Mount Tai and be roasted and broiled, their dried flesh sliced up, and when all these various torments have been completed some will be born as a domestic animal and slaughtered with a blade time and again. If later they are born as a person, they will end up being punished by dismemberment of their corpse all because of this cruel killing. How can anyone ascend to the Heavens having behaved in such a cruel fashion?”
The brahmins responded, “You are still in the morning of life, what do you know that you can take issue with us?”
The royal grandson said, “I was born into brahmin families for five hundred lives in succession! I became familiar with the works on your Way which puts purity and truth at the fore. You are cheats and fakers – how could this accord with the import of your scriptures?” 
The brahmins said, “If you know about our Way, why don’t you explain it?”
The royal grandson explained all saying, “In the brahminical model the sage seeks ultimate purity, but you are enmired in filth, ruthless and insatiable. During these perverted sacrifices you kill people and animals entirely in vain, you drink alcohol and indulge in debauchery, cheating your superiors and impoverishing the people, causing them to turn their back on the Buddha and violate the Law, to distance the worthy rather than treating them with respect. You exhaust your resources on making offerings to demons while your parents are hungry and cold – how can this accord with the sagely pursuit of the high moral conduct of the śramaṇas?”
The brahmins were ashamed and touched their heads to the ground and withdrew. 
 The grandson immediately explained for his grandfather the Supreme, Perfect Awakening and with the utmost sincerity said, “Now if you wish to ascend to the Heavens you must take refuge in the Three Honoured Ones,  awaken to the Four Impermanents [5] and practice the Six Paramitās [6]: you must completely sever feelings of parsimony and greed and intensify your ambition for purity, put oneself in harm’s way for the sake of the masses and let your nourishment reach all living beings. This is the first.  You must follow the Five Rules [7] and take pity on the living and subordinate yourself to save others (1); you must aim to be content with what you have and not take from others what you lack, (2); you must maintain propriety and shun dissolution (3); you must be trustworthy and not deceive (4); you must view wine as a destabilising poison, which causes the decay the filial way (5) and you must follow the Ten Virtues and make your upright conduct an example to your parents. This is the second.  You must bear with fortitude the insults of the masses and pity those crazed with drunkenness; when poison comes go to meet it with compassion and save rather than harm. Explain your actions using the Three Respecteds and the understanding this brings will result in increased joy; your benevolent nurturing should protect all equally, your kindness on a par with the Two Powers [8]. This is the third.  You must forge ahead with keen determination looking upward as you ascend to lofty conduct. This is the fourth.  You must leave the wicked behind and eliminate impurity, fix the mind on silence, as expansive as space. This is the fifth.  You must cultivate wide-ranging learning without obstructions and seek omniscience. This is the sixth.  He who embraces these wide-ranging virtues will be without fault from beginning to end should he seek to become a become a King of the Law (dharmarāja) for the Three Realms he will be able to do so; how could ascent to the Heavens present difficulties? If you offend against the Buddha’s teaching of compassion and exalt the deadly and ruthless, destroy the lives of living beings, take pleasure in licentiousness, and conduct perverted sacrifices, while alive you will be rejected by the gods and on death you will enter one of the Three Mires [9], where life after life, you will decline and die, receiving unlimited misfortune. Yet through this prime malevolence, these evildoers hope to ascend to the Heavens! This like contravening a sovereign’s command yet hoping to be promoted to a high-ranking position!”
The ruler said, “Very good! I trust what you say!”
He opened the prisons and issued a general amnesty and promptly put an end to all types of demonic practices, and then took all the valuables of the entire kingdom and ordered his grandson to use them to promote virtue and the royal grandson took the valuables and distributed them all among the poor. He gave for seven days and no-one went unsatisfied. The giving over, he encouraged the people to uphold the Buddhist rules and all within the boundaries of the kingdom were grateful for being enriched and none did not comply. Heavenly beings, dragons, and spirits all praised his goodness, and rained down rare jewels, all kinds of patterned silks, and grains. The neighbouring realms admired their virtue and converted, like the myriad streams flowing back to the sea. The royal grandson, took his bride, bade farewell to his relatives and returned to his own kingdom.
On their arrival home, they bolted the doors to their quarters and, neglecting official business, gave themselves over to pleasure. When all the officials heard what was going on, they reported this to his father, saying, “If we do not get rid of his wife, the state of the kingdom will decline.”
The father of the King said, “His grandfather gave her to him in marriage – how can we get rid of her?”
He summoned his son and imprisoned him. When his wife heard this, shamefaced, she flew back home to the Seventh Mountains. On the way she saw Youben and his companion and told them saying, “When my husband comes looking give him this.”
And she left a gold ring as a token of her fidelity. When the father heard that his son’s wife had gone he sent his son back to his kingdom. When he did not see his wife, disconsolate, he wept. The divinity who protected the palace said, “Don’t despair! I will show you the way. Your wife is in the Seventh Mountains and if you rush you will be able to catch up with her.”
When the royal grandson heard this, he immediately donned his pearl garment, belted on his sword and picked up his bow. The glow from his robe illuminated a dozen miles. The next morning, he arrived in the Seventh Mountains and he saw that his wife had snapped twigs and placed them on the ground as signs. He saw in front of him two ascetics and he asked them, “Did my wife pass through here?”
The replied, “She did.”
They handed the ring to him and they set off together. Using a tree trunk for a bridge they passed over a small river and arrived atop the Eighth Mountains where they saw a brahmin in the fourth dhyāna. He prostrated himself on the ground before him and bowed his head in respectful greeting and said, “Did you observe my wife passing through here?”
He replied, “She passed through here. Sit awhile and I will show you where she is.”
At that time the King of Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋) transformed himself into a monkey and his divine power shook the mountains. The royal grandson was terrified. The brahmin said, “Do not be frightened! He comes to make offerings to me.”
When the monkey arrived and saw three ascetics, he hesitated and did not advance. The brahmin said, “Come forward!”
The monkey did so and made an offering of fruit, which the brahmin accepted. The four shared it and the brahmin said to the monkey, “Take these three to Divine Humanesque.”
He said, “Who are these people who you want me to allow to ascend to the Heavens?”
The brahmin said, “He is the crown prince of his kingdom, the foremost among Enlightening Heroes. He will be a Thus-come, a Non-Attached, one of Supreme, Perfect Awakening, a Charioteer of the Dharma, a Teacher of Gods and Men, living beings will be the recipients of his nourishing moisture and will get to return to original non-being.”
The Monkey said, “Excellent! The Enlightening Hero will achieve buddhahood and I beg to be his horse.”
Youben and his companion, begged one to be the Bodhisattva’s servant, and the other to become an arhat. The Enlightening Hero said, “Very good!”
They promptly ascended to the Heavens together. En route they encountered five hundred Ones Awakened by Causation Alone (pratyekabuddhas) who all approached and touched their heads to the ground in respect. The monkey was sent back to fetch flowers which he then scattered over the buddhas and expressed his wish, “Permit me to swiftly attain True Awareness and guide living beings to the extinction of birth and death so their spirit returns to original non-being”.
The three also made such a vow and they all bowed their heads to the ground to the buddhas and then left. When they arrived outside the gate to the city of Divine Humanesque, the monkey bowed and withdrew. The three sat down. At that time there was a woman who emerged to draw water. The Enlightening Hero asked her, “What are you doing with that water?”
She replied, “It’s for the King’s daughter’s bath.”
The Enlightening Hero removed his ring and tossed it into the water. When the heavenly maiden saw the ring, she promptly stopped her ablutions and announced to her parents, “My husband has been looking for me and has arrived here.”
Her father, Druma, was overjoyed and quickly came out to greet him. The Enlightening Hero bowed his head to the floor in respect and performed the courtesies of a son-in-law. The two ascetics bowed and withdrew. The ruler invited him in and presented his daughter to him with his own hand. She had more than one thousand maidservants who entertained them with heavenly music. He stayed there for more than seven years, but he kept in mind his parents who had provided life and nourishment; when he spoke of them, he choked with sobs, so he decided to bid his farewells and return to his kingdom. The heavenly King said, “I have now handed over to you all this kingdom has to offer and yet you want to leave, why?”
The Enlightening Hero once again bid his farewells as he had previously. The King said, “Stay for just seven more days. We will make merry together!”
After the seven days, there was a Great Divine Ruler who visited the heavenly king and congratulated him saying, “Your lost daughter returned and brought with her a sagely son-in-law!”
The Heavenly King said, “My daughter is but a lowly creature yet has found herself a sagely and heroic husband who misses home and wants to return and care for his parents. Can I trouble you to escort them home?”
The demon king respectfully assented, and promptly fashioned a palace compound from heavenly jewels, complete with a seven-storey tower, filled with all kinds of precious things and heavenly music such as rarely appear in this world. The demon king lifted them in the palm of his hand and conveyed them home to the Crown Prince’s native land. Having done so he bowed and withdrew. The Enlightening Hero saw his relatives and respectfully explained everything to them. His grandfather was delighted and he abdicated and set his grandson on the throne. The heavenly maidens, ghosts and dragons all praised this as wonderful. The new monarch issued a great amnesty for the mass of criminals. He also made gifts throughout the entire kingdom, to the common folk in all four directions, reaching all sentient beings, helping the poor giving them whatever their hearts’ desired. All beings leapt for joy none not sighing in admiration and praising the Buddha’s benevolent transformations which exceeds even the nourishing of Heaven and Earth. From the eight directions those yearning for such enrichment entered the kingdom, as a young child relies on a loving mother. The grandfather’s life came to an end he was promptly born in the Heavens above.
  The Buddha told Śāriputra, “The royal grandson was me. The brahmin in the fourth dhyāna was you Śāriputra (Quiliuzi 鶖鷺子). Youben is now Mahāmaudgalyāyana (Mulian 目連), Sheli is now Chandaka (Cheni 車匿). The Lord of Heaven Śakra is Kaṇṭhaka (Qiande 揵德). The royal father is Kāśyapa (Jiaye 迦葉); the royal grandfather is now King Śuddhodana Biajing 白淨), the mother was Māya (Shemiao 舍妙). The wife was Gopika (Juyi 俱夷). The Bodhisattva year after year with the four types of wide-ranging kindness and the Six Paramitās assisted sentient beings in numbers difficult to calculate.
When the Buddha had finished expounding this sūtra all the Bodhisattvas, the four kinds of disciples, heavenly beings, dragons, ghosts, and asuras were all overjoyed and having paid their respects, they left.

"《六度集經》卷8：「八四）遮羅國王經「昔者，遮羅國王嫡后無嗣，王甚悼焉，命曰：『爾歸女宗，以求有嗣之術，還吾不[10]尤也。』后泣辭退，誓命自捐，投隕山[11]險，遂之林藪。天帝釋感曰：『斯王元后，故世吾姉也，今以無嗣捐軀山險。』愴然愍之，忽爾降焉，以器盛果授之曰：『姉，爾吞斯果，必有聖嗣，將為世雄。若王有疑，以器示之。斯天[12]王神器，明證之上者。』后仰[13]天吞果，忽然不覩天帝所之。應則身重，還宮覩王，具以[14]誠聞。時滿生男，厥狀[15]甚陋，覩世希有。年在齠齓，聰明博暢，智策無儔，力能躃象，走攫飛鷹，舒聲響震若師子吼，名流遐邇，八方咨嗟。王為納隣國之女，厥名月光，端正妍雅，世好備足。次有七弟，又亦姝[16]好。后懼月光，惡太子狀，訛曰：『吾國舊儀，家室無白日相見，禮之[17]重也。妃無失儀矣。』對曰：『敬諾，不敢替尊教。』自斯之後，太子出入未甞別色，深惟：『本國與七國為敵，力諍無寧，兆民呼嗟！吾將權而安之。』心自惟曰：『吾體至陋，妃覩必邁，邁則天下康、兆民休矣。』欣而啟后欲一覩妃觀厥[18]儀容。后曰：『爾狀醜矣。妃容華豔，厥齊天女；覺即捨邁，爾終為鰥[19]矣。』太子重辭，后愍之，即順其願。將妃觀馬，太子佯為牧人，妃覩之曰：『牧人醜乎？』后曰：『斯先王牧夫矣。』後將觀象，妃又覩焉，疑之曰：『吾之所遊輙覩斯人，將是太子乎？』妃曰：『願見太子之光容。』后即權之，令其兄弟出遊行國，太子官僚翼從侍衛。后妃觀之，厥心微喜。後又入苑，太子登樹，以果擲背，妃曰：『斯是太子定矣。』夜伺其眠，默以火照，覩其姿狀，懼而奔歸。后忿曰：『焉使妃還乎？』對曰：『妃邁天下泰平之基，民終寧其親矣。』拜辭尋之。「至妃國，佯為陶家，賃作瓦器，器妙絕國。陶主覩妙，齎以獻王。王獲器喜，以賜小女，傳現諸姉。月光知婿之所為，投地壞焉。又入城賃染眾綵，結其一疋為眾奇巧，雜伎充滿覩世希[20]見。染家欣異，又以獻王。王重悅之，以示八女。月光識焉，捐而不[21]覩。又為大臣賃養馬，馬肥又調，曰：『爾悉有何[22]伎乎？』對曰：『太官眾味余其備矣。』臣令為饌以獻大王。王曰：『孰為斯食？』臣如實對。王命為[23]太官，監典諸[24]餚膳。以羹入內供王八女，欲致權道佯覆[25]沃身，諸女驚懼，月光不眄。天帝釋喜歎曰：『菩薩憂濟眾生乃至于茲乎？吾將權而助之焉。』挑七敵國使會女都，爾乃兆民[26]元禍息矣。化為月光父王手書，以月光妻之。七國興禮造國親迎，俱會相勞：『翔茲何為？』各云：『[27]娉娶女名月光。』訟之紛紛，各出手書，厥怨齊聲：『當滅爾[28]嗣，其為不[29]忒。』遣使還書，僉然詰曰：『以爾一女弄吾七國，怨齊兵盛，爾[30]國喪在[31]乎今矣。』父王懼曰：『斯禍弘矣。將宿行所招乎？』謂月光曰：『爾為人妃，若婿明愚吉凶好醜，厥由宿命，孰能[1]禳之？而不貞一盡孝奉尊。薄婿還國，禍至于茲。吾今當七分爾尸以謝七王耳。』月光泣曰：『願假吾命漏[2]刻之期，募求智士，必有能却七國之患者也。』王即募曰：『孰能[＊]禳斯禍者，妻以月光，育以[3]原福。』太子曰：『疾作高觀，吾其[＊]禳之。』觀成，太子權病[4]躇步[5]倒地：『須月光荷負，爾乃却敵矣。』月光惶灼懼見屠戮，扶[6]胳登觀，僅能[7]立焉。太子高聲謂七國王，厥音遠震若師[8]子吼，喻以佛教：『為天牧民當以仁道，而今興怒，怒盛即禍著。禍著即身喪。夫喪身失國，其由名色乎？』七國師雄靡不尸蹌者，斯須而穌，欲旋本土。「太子啟[9]王：『婚姻之道，莫若諸王矣。何不以七女[10]嫡彼七王。子婿蕃屏，王元康矣！臣民休矣！親獲養矣！』王曰：『善哉！斯樂大矣！』遂命七王以女妻之。八婿禮豐，君民欣欣。于斯王逮臣民，始知太子，月光之舊婿，即選良輔武士翼從，各令還國。九國和寧，兆民抃舞，僉然[11]讚歎曰：『天降吾父！夫聖人權術非凡所照。』德聚功成，[12]爾乃[13]炅然無復譏謗。「還國有年，大王崩殂，太子代位。[14]太赦眾罪，以五戒六度、八齋十善，教化兆民。災𦾨都息，國豐眾安，大化流行，皆奉三尊，德盛福歸，眾病消滅，顏影[15]韑韑，踰彼桃華。所以然者？菩薩宿命室家俱耕，令妻取食，望覩妻還，與一辟支佛俱，行隱山岸，久[16]久而不至。疑心生焉，興忿執鋤，欲往捶之。至見其妻，以所食分，供養沙門，退叉手立。沙門食竟，[17]拋鉢虛空，光明[18]暐曄，飛行而退。婿心悔愧，念妻有德乃致斯尊，吾有重愚將受其殃。即謂妻曰：『爾供養福，吾當共之。餘飯俱食，爾無訧也。』至其命終，各生王家。妻有淳慈之惠，生而端正；婿先恚而後慈，故初醜而後好也。」佛告諸比丘：「夫人作行，先惠而後奪，後世初生豪富，長即貧困；初奪後惠，後世受之，先貧賤而[19]後長富貴。太子者，[20]是我身也。妻者，[21]俱夷是。父王者，白淨王是。母者，吾母舍妙是。天帝釋者，彌勒[22]是。開士世世憂念眾生拯濟塗炭。菩薩普智度無極行明施如是。」」(CBETA 2023.Q3, T03, no. 152, pp. 46b05-47b15)[10] 尤【大】，訧【宋】【元】【明】　[11] 險【大】，岨【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 王【大】，皇【宋】【元】【明】　[13] 天【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[14] 誠【大】，誠上【宋】【元】【明】　[15] 甚【大】，尤【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 好【大】，嚴【宋】【元】【明】　[17] 重【大】，重者【宋】【元】【明】　[18] 儀容【大】，容儀【宋】【元】【明】　[19] 矣【大】，乎【宋】【元】【明】　[20] 見【大】，現【宋】【元】【明】　[21] 覩【大】，視【宋】【元】【明】　[22] 伎【大】，技【元】【明】　[23] 太【大】，大【宋】　[24] 餚【大】，肴【宋】【元】【明】　[25] 沃【大】，[泛-之+友]【宋】【元】【明】　[26] 元【大】，無【宋】【元】【明】　[27] 娉【大】，聘【明】　[28] 嗣【大】，祀【宋】【元】【明】　[29] 忒【大】，𠍜【宋】，貸【元】【明】　[30] 國喪【大】，喪國【宋】【元】【明】　[31] 乎【大】，于【宋】【元】【明】　[1] 禳【大】＊，攘【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[2] 刻【大】，剋【宋】　[＊1-1] 禳【大】＊，攘【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[3] 原【大】，元【宋】【元】【明】　[＊1-2] 禳【大】＊，攘【宋】＊【元】＊【明】＊　[4] 躇【大】，跬【元】【明】　[5] 倒【大】，頓【宋】【元】【明】　[6] 胳【大】，格【宋】【元】【明】　[7] 立【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[8] 子【大】，子之【宋】【元】【明】　[9] 王【大】，王曰【宋】【元】【明】　[10] 嫡【大】，適【宋】【元】【明】　[11] 讚【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[12] 爾乃【大】，乃爾【元】【明】　[13] 炅【大】＊，焸【宋】＊　[14] 太【大】，大【宋】【元】【明】　[15] 韑韑踰【大】，煒煒喻【宋】【元】【明】　[16] 久【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[17] 拋【大】，挑【宋】　[18] 暐曄【大】，煒燁【宋】【元】【明】　[19] 後【大】，〔－〕【宋】【元】【明】　[20] 是我【大】，吾【宋】【元】【明】　[21] 俱【大】，裘【宋】【元】【明】　[22] 是【大】，是也【宋】【元】【明】","In former times the consort of the King of Pañcāla (Zheluoguo 遮羅國) [1] had produced no heirs and the King, sorely grieved by this situation, gave her this order: “Go back to your parents and seek out a method for conceiving an heir. On your return I will not hold it against you.”
The Queen wept as she took her leave and vowed to take her own life. She flung herself off some mountain defile, but somehow ended up in marshy woodland. The King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋) saw this and was moved, saying, “This royal wife was my older sister in a previous existence and now, because she has failed to provide an heir, she has thrown herself off a mountain defile!”
Full of sorrow he took pity on her, came down and, offering her a platter full of fruit said, “Sister, eat this fruit and you will produce a sagely heir who will be a World Hero. If the King harbours any suspicions show him this platter. This is the divine platter of the King of Gods and will provide the highest proof of your word. The Queen looked heavenward and swallowed the fruit, but all of a sudden, the Heavenly King was nowhere to be seen. Immediately she concived and returned to the palace to see the King and informed him of all that had happened. When her time came, she gave birth to an incredibly ugly son, one such as is rarely seen in this world. By the time he lost his milk teeth his understanding was wide ranging and comprehensive, his wise analyses second to none. He was strong enough to topple an elephant, swift enough to catch a hawk in flight, and when his voice rang out it resounded like a lion’s roar. His fame spread near and far, people in all directions gasped in admiration. The King selected a girl from a neighbouring kingdom to be his wife. Her name was Moonbeam (Yueguang月光). Beautiful and elegant, she was possessed of all the admirable qualities. She had seven younger sisters all equally lovely. The Queen feared that Moonbeam would abhor the Prince’s appearance and so she dissembled saying, “Our kingdom has an ancient custom: a wife does not set eyes on her husband during daylight hours. We take this custom very seriously. Please Princess do not forget our ways!”
She replied, “Of course. I would not dare go against your esteemed instruction.”
From this time on, the Prince came and went without his wife ever discerning his appearance. He thought deeply: “The Princess’ home kingdom has seven enemies, there is never any peace as all disputes are strongly contested. The common people cry out in lament! I will use an expedient to bring them peace.”
He thought to himself, “My body is hideous, when my wife sees me, she will certainly return home and when that happens the world will be peaceful and the common folk will get some respite.”
Joyfully he told the Queen that he wanted to take a look at his wife and observe her appearance. The Queen said, “You are very ugly and the Princess is gorgeous, the equal of any heavenly maiden. When she realises, she will up and return home. You will spend the rest of your life like a widower!”
With sadness the Prince took his leave, and the Queen felt so sorry for him she acceded to his request. She led the Princess to see the horses and the Prince accompanied them pretending to be the groom. The princess saw him and exclaimed, “That groom is hideous!”
The Queen said, “That is the former king’s groom.”
Later she took her to see the elephants and the Princess noticed him again and, suspecting something was afoot, thought, “Wherever I go I see that man, might he be the Prince?”
She said, “I wish to see the honoured countenance of the Prince.”
The Queen evaluated the situation and then asked her younger brother to go abroad in the kingdom. The Prince’s retinue of officials and bodyguards accompanied him. The Queen and the Princess observed them and the Princess felt a little joy. Later they went into the gardens and the Prince who had climbed up a tree, hurled a piece of fruit at her back. She thought, “This is definitely the Prince.”
At night she kept watch until he fell asleep, then silently, she took a torch and had a look at him. Horrified, she swiftly returned home.
The Queen angrily said to the Prince, “How are you going to get her back?”
He replied, “The Princess’ return to her natal land will lay the groundwork for peace in the world. The people will at long last get to protect their families.”
He bid his mother farewell and went to look for his wife. When he got to her kingdom, he pretended to be a potter looking for work making clay items. His pots were unsurpassed in the kingdom and the master potter saw this and took one as tribute to the King. Upon receiving the pot the King was delighted, and made a gift of it to his youngest daughter who showed it to her elder sisters. Moonbeam intuited that it had been made by her husband and threw it to the floor damaging it. Then he entered the city to hire himself out as a dyer of coloured silks. The bolt he prepared was regarded by the multitude as quite exquisite, produced by skill rarely seen in this world. The dyer was overjoyed at this outstanding work and also presented it to the King who was once again very pleased and gave it to his eight daughters. Moonbeam knew where it had come from and cast it to one side refusing to look at it. The Prince moved on and took employ with a minister as a groom. The horses were well fed and well trained, and he said, “What other skills do you have?”
He replied, “I can prepare all the delicacies of the royal kitchens.”
The minister had him prepare some dishes to lay before the King who asked, “Who prepared this food?”
The minister answered truthfully. The King ordered the Prince to become his Grand Provisioner [2] responsible for overseeing the preparation of all the dishes. The prince took some soup into the women’s quarters to offer to the King’s eight daughters. As part of his expedient plan, he pretended to spill the soup drenching himself. The women were all shocked, but Moonbeam didn’t even look up. The King of the Gods, Śakra, joyfully said to himself, “The Bodhisattva will even go as far as this to save living beings! I will employ an expedient to assist him! I will provoke the seven rival kings to come and meet at the women’s city, then the great disasters that afflict the common folk will stop.”
He transformed himself into Moonbeam’s father and in his own hand wrote offering Moonbeam in marriage to the kings of the seven enemy kingdoms. They each set in motion the marriage rituals and arrived at the kingdom to receive their bride. They all met and troubled by one another’s presence, asked, “What are you doing here?”
They each said, “I am here to take a wife. Her name is Moonbeam.”
The disputes came thick and fast. Each brought out his letter. In their anger they chorused, “His descendants should be exterminated! This cannot be forgiven!”
They jointly sent an envoy to reply to the letter saying, “You have used your daughter to toy with our seven kingdoms. We are equally furious and our vigorous armies stand ready – the destruction of your kingdom is imminent!”
Her royal father said fearfully, “This is a disaster of far-reaching implications! What did I do in a past life to bring this about?”
He said to Moonbeam, “You are a princess. Whether your husband was clever or stupid, good or wicked, handsome or ugly, this is the result of your conduct in former lives, who can avoid it? Yet you did not do the right thing and act in a filial way and pay your husband proper respect. You held your husband in contempt and returned home and led us to this unfortunate state! I am now going to chop you into seven pieces to give to these seven kings by way of apology.”
Moonbeam wept, saying, “Pray grant me one period of the water-clock so we can seek out a wise man. There must be someone able to hold off the disaster the seven kingdoms are threatening!”
The King immediately began a search for such a person saying, “Whoever is able to avert this calamity will have Moonbeam’s hand in marriage and I will cherish you as if you had been my own child, my ‘original good fortune.’”
The Crown Prince said, “Quick! Construct a tall tower and I will avert the calamity!”
When the tower was completed, the Prince expediently feigned illness, took a step and fell to the ground. He insisted Moonbeam carry him so he could repulse the enemies. Moonbeam was so terrified, fearing she was about to be butchered that, supporting the Prince under the arms as they climbed the tower, she was barely able to stand. The Prince loudly addressed the kings of the seven kingdoms. His voice rang out resounding like a lion’s roar as he explained the Buddha’s teachings with an analogy, “One who ‘shepherds men for the Heavens’ must do so by the humane Way, but now you are angry and where anger flourishes disaster will follow, disaster will lead to bodily destruction. Destruction of the body will mean loss of the kingdom, all because of a beautiful woman!”
 The heroic troops of the seven kingdoms, who had been like walking corpses, all instantly came to their senses  and wanted to return to their own kingdoms.
The Prince told the King, “None are better suited as husbands than these kings. Why not offer your seven daughters in marriage to them? As your sons-in-law they will protect you and bring your Majesty great peace, your subjects will gain some respite, and their parents will get to be supported!”
The King said: “Very good! This will bring great joy!”
Then he ordered the seven kings to take a daughter each in marriage. The eight sons-in-law conducted magnificent marriage ceremonies and ruler and subjects were overjoyed. It was only then that the King and his subjects realised than the Prince was Moonbeam’s former husband. Excellent advisers and soldiers were selected to escort each king and their bride to their own kingdom and nine kingdoms lived in peace and harmony. The common folk clapped their hands and danced, and everyone praised the Prince saying, “The Heavens have sent down a father for us! The expedient scheme this sage employed would never have occurred to an ordinary person!”
As his virtues accumulated and his efforts were successful, his appearance was no longer scorned or criticised. Some years after he returned to his own kingdom the great ruler died and the Prince took his place on the throne. He issued an amnesty for all crimes and taught and converted the common folk with the Five Rules, the Six Paramitās, the Eight Fasts and the Ten Good Behaviours. All calamities ceased, the kingdom flourished and the masses were content. The great transformation was widespread and all revered the Three Honoured Ones. Where virtue flourished, good fortune was restored; all illness was eradicated. The Prince’s appearance grew quite dazzling, surpassing that of peach blossom. How did this come to be so? In a previous existence, the Bodhisattva and his wife were ploughing and he asked his wife to get him some food. From a distance he saw her returning with a pratyekabuddha, they were walking along a precipitous mountain path and after a very long time they did not appear. Suspicion entered his mind and with surging anger, he clutched his hoe and went off intending to give him a thrashing. When he arrived, he saw that his wife had divided their food and given some to the śramaṇa and had stepped back and was standing with her hands clasped. When the śramaṇa had finished eating, he flung his bowl into the sky, which flew away with a dazzling radiance and then flew back again. The husband felt full of remorse, believing his wife must be of such virtue she had caused the arrival of this respected man, he thought to himself, “I have been very stupid and will surely have brought disaster to bear upon myself.”
The he said to his wife, “Your offering will bring good fortune, I ought to share in it. You eat the remaining food – you have done nothing wrong.”
When they reached the end of their lives each was born in a royal household. The wife was of pure and compassionate kindness and was born beautiful. The husband had been first angry before becoming compassionate and for this reason he started off ugly and later became handsome.
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus, “Now if a person is first a giver and then becomes a taker, in a subsequent life he will be born into a wealthy household but will be impoverished as an adult; If you are a taker first, but become a giver, when you receive another life first you will be poor and of low status, but later you will be wealthy and grand. The Crown Prince was me, my wife was Yaśodharā (Juyi 俱夷). The father of the King was my father, the mother was Māyā (Shemiao 舍妙). The King of the Gods, Śakra was Maitreya (Mile 彌勒).”
   The Enlightening Hero life after life worried about living beings and saved them from hardship.
  Such is the extensive, intelligent, limitless wisdom practiced by the Bodhisattva.

Open-minded and sensible by nature, he was conversant with, and he had thought deeply on, all scriptures and techniques considering which most represented the Truth and which brought about the greatest peace. He thought to himself with a sigh, “Indeed the Buddhist scriptures contain the True; non-action brings the most peace.”
He went on, “I will embrace the True and reside in the peaceful.”
His parents wanted to find him a wife, but distressed he said, “Of all the multitudinous monstrous misfortunes that can befall one, none is greater than the lure of the feminine form! When a bewitching female arrives, morality dies. If I do not flee faraway, I will be devoured by such a wolf!”
So, he fled to another land where he took a job as a labourer to support himself. At that time there was an old farmer, aged and without an heir. Passing through the grassland he came across a girl, whose beauty outshone the rest of that kingdom’s young women. Joyful, he raised her as his heir and was looking for a husband for her, but throughout the kingdom he had found no one suitable. The old man employed the Bodhisattva for five years and had observed his moral behaviour in matters from the inconspicuous to the visible, and felt very favourably towards him, and said, “Son, I have everything I need. Take my girl in marriage and be my heirs!” 
The girl was of unearthly virtue. This confused the Bodhisattva’s mind and he married her. But before long he realised what he had done and said, “I now understand why the enlightening teachings of the Buddhas regard physical beauty as the flame; man is but a fluttering moth – the moth’s longing for the flame gets it burned. This old man has burned my body with the flame of form, his wealth hooked me like a fish – the filth of the household has destroyed my virtue.”
In the night he fled soundlessly and travelled more than thirty miles relying on empty watchtowers to spend the night. One night the watchtower warden asked, “Who are you?”
He replied, “I’m hoping to spend the night here.”
The warden led him inside where he saw some magnificent bedding decorated with dazzling rarities. There was a woman there who looked just like his wife. This confused the Bodhisattva’s mind and he lived with her for a total five years before his bright mind awakened to this situation and he declared, “Licentiousness is like a venomous spider which can harm your body endangering your life. When I realised this I swiftly went into hiding, but calamity struck and I encountered her once more.”
Keeping quiet he swiftly fled far away, but next he saw a palace, bejewelled, with a woman as before and once again, this confused his mind and he stayed with her for ten years. Then his bright mind was awakened to this situation and he said, “Serious misfortunes have befallen me; I ran, but I could not hide!”
Gravely, he swore to himself, “I will never spend another night here!”
Once again, he made an escape. In the distance he saw a large house and travelled through the fields, but the watchman asked, “Who goes there this night?”
He replied, “I’m hurrying to that village ahead.”
The watchman said, “That is not permitted! Do not proceed!”
From within someone called out and came forward and what he saw there was the same as described above. His wife said, “An incalculable number of kalpas ago you took an oath to be my husband. Where could you go to avoid this?”
The Bodhisattva pondered on this, and said, “The roots of desire are difficult to pull out, this shows as much!”
Then he brought to mind the Four Impermanents [1], saying, “I wish to mediate on impermanence, suffering, emptiness and no-self to eliminate the filth of the Triple World. How could it be that your filth alone would be impervious to destruction!”
He brought to mind these four, and the demon wife was destroyed, it was as if his mind was aflame and he saw all the Buddhas standing before him and they explained meditations on emptiness, no-desire and non-thought, he received the precepts of the śramaṇa and became an unsurpassed teacher.
  Such is the extensive, intelligent, limitless wisdom practiced by the Bodhisattva.

From [2] his teachers he learned how to look up and observe the patterns of the Heavens and having heard or seen all the books on omens and prognostication he acquired a thorough understanding; he guarded the True and valued the filial. The learned of the kingdom admired him. His teacher said, “You have perfected the methods and your skills are complete. Why not go travelling aiming to teach and planting the sprouts [of good conduct]?”
He replied, “My lot is that of a poor man without assets, I have no means to repay your care. For this reason, I do not dare leave. My mother is sick and in extremis, and I have no way of paying a doctor to treat her. I am going to seek employment and earn enough to buy medicine for her.” 
His teacher said, “Very good!”
He bowed his head in respect and withdrew.
As he travelled through a nearby kingdom, he observed five hundred brahmins. They were gathered in a lecture hall and had set up a platform. Next to it was a beautiful woman together with five hundred pieces of gold and silver. It was intended that men would ascend and sit on the platform and learned scholars would argue with them and to the one who most understood the Way’s profundities they would award the woman and the money. The Bodhisattva approached to see what was going on and he saw their understanding was shallow and when challenged they were unable to find a response, so he said to the assembled scholars, “I am also the son of a brahmin, may I join in?
They all said, “You may!”
So he ascended the platform. Where the scholars’ challenges were superficial, his responses on morality were wide-ranging; where their questions were narrow, his explanations were of broad import. The scholars said, “One of such lofty morality and far-reaching wisdom can be our teacher!”
They all lowered their heads to the floor and the Bodhisattva withdrew. All the scholars said, “Although he is of lofty wisdom, this chap is a foreigner. He ought not to wed a woman of our kingdom, but we can increase the amount of money we give him.”
The Bodhisattva replied, “One of lofty morality has profound virtue. I desire to take the Way of no-desire and you desire treasures. Through the Way is the divine passed on, through virtue is sagacity transmitted; if the divine and the sagacious are passed on, their transformative influence continue. This is what is called having good posterity! You want to stop up the source of the Way and cut the roots of virtue; that’s what is called having no descendants!”
After speaking he withdrew, leaving the learned men chastened and ashamed.
The woman said, “That man of integrity is my lord!”
And she hitched up her skirts and went after him. She followed in his footsteps as he passed through many kingdoms. Her strength exhausted and her feet lacerated she stopped by the side of the road when she arrived at the kingdom of Padma. The ruler whose name was Zhisheng (制勝 ‘Subduer’) was carrying out an inspection tour of his borders. He noticed this exhausted woman resting and asked, “Who are you and what are you doing by the roadside?”
The woman explained everything and the ruler was delighted by her resolve and very moved by her plight. He ordered the woman, saying “Follow me back to the palace and I will treat you as my daughter.”
The woman said, “How could I eat the food of another family, undeserving as I am? But I wish to do my duty and to follow your Great Majesty.”
The ruler said, “Gather some beautiful blooms which you can offer for my adornment.”
The woman respectfully agreed and followed the ruler back to his palace. The following day she gathered flowers to present to the ruler. Rutong returned home and he saw people thronging the roads, levelling them and sweeping them and he asked a passers-by, “The common folk seem very happy. Is there some occasion for celebration?”
They replied, “The Thus Come Dīpaṃkara (Dingguang rulai 定光如來), he who is One Bound by no Ties, he who has attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening, a Charioteer of the Way, the Teacher of Heavenly Beings and Men, is coming to teach so the masses are happy.”
Rutong was delighted and silently he entered a state of concentration, his heart was pure and without defilements and he observed the Buddha coming. On the road he encountered the woman mentioned previously who had gathered flowers and held them in a jug under her arm. He asked for the flowers and she gave him five stems. The King, his consort and the common folk were all out repairing the road themselves. The Bodhisattva asked for a small piece of ground to see to himself, but the people replied, “What’s left is a small rivulet down which water rushes in torrents and earth and stones won’t stay put.”
The Bodhisattva thought to himself, “I could bring down that small star to plug the gap by the power of meditation!”
But he reflected, “When performing a rite of offering it is better if you suffer by expending the force of the Four Great Elements yourself.”
So, he set aside the idea of the star, and using the strength of his own body, carted stones to fill it in, then kept them in place by the power of meditation. There remained a small sodden trench and when the Buddha arrived, he took off his deer skin coat and placed it over the wet ground. He scattered the five stems over the Buddha and the flowers arrayed themselves in mid-air as if some hand had planted their roots in the ground.
The Buddha told him, “After ninety-one kalpas you will be a Buddha, your name will be the Thus Come One “Able to be Benevolent” (Śākyamuni) [3], One Bound by no Ties, one who has attained the Supreme, Perfect Awakening, a Charioteer of the Way, the Teacher of Heavenly Beings and Men. At this time the world will have been turned upside down, fathers and sons will be enemies, and the royal government will harm the people like a shower of knives. The people will attempt to evade this but it will be hard to avoid these troubles. You will save those living beings and at that time it will be difficult to reckon the numbers of those saved.”
Rutong was overjoyed and leapt height of seven men into the air. On his descent he spread his hair over the ground and invited the Buddha to walk over it. When the World Honoured One had stepped over, he told the bhikṣus, “Tread no more on this spot! Why? Because the place where a prediction is made is worthy of unequalled respect. A wise man will raise a stūpa here and will receive the same prediction.” [4]
The heavenly beings chorused, “I will build the stūpa!”
At this moment a householder’s son by the name of Xiangan (賢乾), took a small bit of firewood and stuck it in the ground saying, “My stūpa is already built!”
The heavenly beings looked at one another and said, “This ordinary lad has the wisdom of a superior sage!”
They immediately arranged for cartloads of jewels to be delivered to the spot to build the stūpa. Bowing their heads to the ground they declared, “We vow to attain buddhahood and teach as we saw done today. Now the stūpa has been built what good fortune lies in store for Xiangan?”
The World Honoured One replied, “When Rutong is a Buddha, you will receive your predictions.”
  The Buddha told Śāriputra (Qiuluzi 鶖鷺子), “Rutong was me, the woman who sold the flowers is now Yaśodharā (Juyi 俱夷). The householder’s son is now among the seated here, Feiluoyu (非羅余).”
Feiluoyu touched his head to the Buddha’s feet and the Buddha made the following prediction, “You will become a Buddha by the name of Quick-sight.”
When the Buddha finished this sūtra all four types of follower, gods, men, dragons and ghosts, were all filled with joy, and touched their heads to the ground and withdrew.
  Such is the extensive, intelligent, limitless wisdom practiced by the Bodhisattva.

[2] Reading zi 自 rather than bai 白 following the Song, Yuan and Ming editions of the canon.
[3] “Able to be Benevolent” (nengren 能仁) is an early (and evidently incorrect) translation of “Śākyamuni”.
[4] On the term cha 刹 see Karashima 2017. I tentatively suggest that here it seems appropriate that cha 刹 is interpreted as stūpa (cf. No. 17 of this collection). Karashima points to Xuanying's misguided understanding, refelected in his Yiqie jing yinyi 一切經音義, (and in its derivatives), that this term means a stick or a pole that is part of a stūpa. In this context as we have a bit of wood being stuck in the ground this might be to stand for a pole that in turn stands for a stūpa. In addition, Xuanzang records stūpas were erected by King Aśoka to mark where these events occured (in Nagarahāra, modern Jalalabad), ancient remains having survived the end of kalpa destruction: see Da Tang xiyu ji 大唐西域記 (T2087 Vol. 51 878c5-11) and see also the records of Faxian's earlier travels, the Gaoseng Faxian zhuan 高僧法顯傳 (T2085 Vol. 51 858c24-26). This perhaps reflects a local tradition from the source of this story, but more research is required."

At one time the Blessed One sat beneath a tree in the kingdom of Wuyi (無夷). The shine of his lustrous countenance surpassed that of the finest purple gold. He smiled joyfully and five-coloured rays shone from his mouth. Those who witnessed this all leapt for joy, and together praised him saying, “Truly he deserves to be called a God among Gods!”
Ānanda (A’nan 阿難) straightened his robes and bowing his head to the ground said, “The Blessed One’s smile must surely show his desire to save sentient beings from the darkness!”
The Blessed One said, “Excellent! It is indeed as you say. I do not smile for no reason, but to promote the Law (dharma). Do you want to know the meaning of the smile?”
Ānanda replied saying, “We hunger and thirst for the sagely scriptures. Truly we can never have our fill!”
The Blessed One said:
 In the past there was a sage king whose name was Modiao (摩調), a Flying Emperor (cakravartin) ruling over the Four Continents. His mind was correct and his conduct fair, the people harboured no secret resentments. Compassionate, he protected joyfully, his intentions like the King of the Gods, Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋). At that time human lifespan was eighty thousand years. The ruler had the Seven Treasures: a turning purple gold wheel, a flying white elephant, a divine magenta horse, a divine bright-moon pearl, a jade woman for his sagely consort, a sagely minister in charge of the treasury, and a sagely minister in command of military matters [1]. The ruler had one thousand sons, good looking, humane and calm. They understood the past and were able to predict the future; persons of intelligence all admired and respected them.
The ruler wanted to make a tour of inspection of the eastern, western, southern, and northern continents. No sooner had this thought formed than the golden wheel was in front of him and went wherever he wanted; the seven treasures all behaved like this, flying and guiding the sage king. Gods, dragons, and good spirits all provided protection scattering all manner of precious flowers before him, wishing him unlimited life. The ruler ordered his body servants in charge of his personal care, “When you notice white hairs growing on my head you must tell me immediately! White hair is clear evidence of decline and death. When they appear I will cast off the labour attendant upon following the customs of the defiled world, and pursue the practice of purity and tranquillity.”
The body servants did as they were ordered and later when they found a white hair, they promptly reported it. The ruler was glad and he summoned the Crown Prince and said, “My head has produced white hairs. Such white is proof of impermanence.  I should no longer disperse my thoughts in a world which will not benefit. Now I place you on the throne to rule over the Four Continents. The officials and peoples will entrust their lives to you and you will care for them. If you model your conduct on mine you can avoid the evil way, and when white hairs appear, you must relinquish the kingdom and commit to becoming a śramaṇa. Instruct your son when you pass the throne to him to establish the Four Equalities [2], the Five Precepts, and the Ten Kinds of Good Behaviour as premier among his teachings.”
  Having finished delivering this wise instruction, he promptly left his kingdom and settled in a hut beneath a tree. He shaved his hair, put on the dharma robes and became a śramaṇa. All his officials and the common people stamped their feet in mourning, united in their grief. King Modiao’s descendants continued for eighty four thousand generations and the Correct Law of the Sagely Sovereign was finally about to be lost. The sage king Modiao returned relinquishing the Heavens, his soul descending to be born the son of the final King, once again a Flying Emperor, named Nan (南). The Correct Law was reinvigorated. In his wisdom he decreed that those within palace, the Queen and the concubines, all uphold the Eight Rules on the Six Fast days each month, namely to
1. show benevolence and compassion, and cherish the lives of all living beings;
2. take care not to steal, and if wealthy, to aid the poor;
3. remain chaste and pure and guard the True;
4 maintain the faith and talk about the Buddhist teachings;
5. be filial to the utmost and let no alcohol pass your lips;
6. refrain from lying on a high couch with embroidered drapes;
7. let no food pass your lips afternoon and evening; and
8. take care not to permit fragrance, flowers, or cosmetics to come near your person and do not contaminate your conduct with bawdy song or debauched music; do not think of these things, speak of them, nor act on them.
The ruler ordered the sagely officials to lead all through conduct, from nobles to the lower orders. People, no matter whether high ranking or low, were ordered to uphold the Six Fasts, to study the Eight Precepts for their enjoyment, carry a copy about their person and recite them three times each day, to be filial and obedient to their parents, respectful and supportive of the elderly, and to respect and support those who have stilled their minds and to go to them to receive the scriptures. To widows and widowers, the young and weak, and those who begged, he gave succour; to the sick he supplied medicine, clothes, and food to aid them, those suffering from want and those without, he ordered to come to the palace and ask for whatever they needed. Those who did not obey and transform he imposed a heavy workload and settled them amidst five virtuous families and ordered the five to convert the one, and as soon as they did, they were rewarded. He selected his principal officials of the basis of their virtue and not their noble rank. Following the implementation of the King’s Bright Law the peoples of the Four Continents showed kindness and friendliness to one another, any murderous intent dissipated. The people always got whatever they deserved; at night they did not bolt their doors, they were chaste and pure and did not desire women who were not their wives. [They told the truth,] not misrepresenting ‘one’ as ‘two’, and taught benevolence and compassion, they understood the reality of impermanence, and they did not embroider their speech. They rejoiced in others’ good fortune offering words of congratulation. The Great Way transformed their conduct and viciousness disappeared. They trusted in the Buddha, the Law (dharma) and the śramaṇas, and their words no longer betrayed any doubts. King Nan’s compassionate nourishment reached everywhere; in each of the Eight Directions, and from the zenith to the nadir, there were none who did not praise his virtue. The ruler of the Second Heaven [3], Śakra, the Four Heavenly Kings, the deities of the sun, the moon, and the constellations, the sea dragons and the earth deities, discussed him daily saying, “The reach of this human rulers’ Four Kindnesses exceeds that of the deities.”
The King of the Gods Śakra asked the deities, “Would you like to meet with King Nan?”
The deities replied, “It has been our longstanding wish to do so, truly we would like to take you up on this suggestion.”
In the time it would take to stretch out your arm, Lord Śakra arrived above the palace where King Nan was dispensing his charity, and seeing King Nan said, “Oh Sage King of consummate virtue! The deities hunger and thirst to meet with you, not a day passes on which they do not express this desire. Would your Sagely Majesty like to see Trayastriṃśa Heaven on high where all desires are spontaneously fulfilled?”
King Nan said, “Excellent! I have been wanting to go on such an excursion.”
The Lord Śakra returned to his heaven and summoned his charioteer named Moluo (摩婁) and ordered, “Use my precious thousand-horse carriage to fetch King Nan here.”
The charioteer did as he had been ordered and went to get King Nan in the heavenly carriage. The carriage came to a standstill outside the palace and the ministers and common folk were all astounded. Never had such an auspicious compliment been granted to a sage ruler they declared to one another, and all within the borders rejoiced: “Our King’s universal compassion nourishes all living beings, he cultivates himself keeping the six monthly fasts and adhering to the eight rules, and further he instructs his people to do likewise – this is virtue of magnitude! This has caused the Lord Śakra to respect and cherish him and come and welcome him to his heaven!”
 King Nan ascended the carriage and the carriage horses took off and slowly flew back and forth so everyone could see them. The King told the charioteer, “Would you take me to see the two paths that the evil take to receive punishment of broiling and beating for their deeds in former lives as evil men, that is, hell and where the hungry ghosts reside?”
The charioteer did as requested and then ascended to the heavens. Lord Śakra joyfully got down from his couch to greet King Nan saying, “You have exercised your mind on the correct way things should be, and have been anxious to save living beings, the Four Kindnesses and the Six Paramitās are the Bodhisattva’s great undertaking, and all the divinities wanted to meet with you.”
Lord Śakra came forward himself, took the king’s arm and together they sat down.
King Nan’s body became increasingly fragrant and pure. With his handsome face glowing, he was no different from Lord Śakra. Then wonderful music began to play, its reach limitless, and the fragrance of precious flowers spread in a way never seen before.
Śakra went on, “Take care not to pine for your former home in the world of men. You have the favour of the heavenly deities!”
But King Nan was focused on teaching and converting the ignorant and benighted, to eliminate all evil intent and to lead to understanding of the Three Honoured Ones, and replied to the King of the Gods Śakra saying, “If one borrows something belonging to another, one ought to return it to its owner. Now this heavenly seat is not my permanent abode, and in a short while I will return to the world of men to instruct my sons and grandsons using the Buddha’s Bright Law to correct their minds and govern the kingdom. I will cause filial obedience to be passed on and rules implemented which will result in good conduct. When released from my human body I will ascend and be born in the Heavens, when I will make merry with Lord Śakra.”
  The Buddha told Ānanda, “King Nan was me. My sons and grandsons have succeeded one another for eighty-four thousand generations each father putting their son on the throne then becoming a śramaṇa.”
  Ānanda was full of joy and touched his head to the ground and said, “The Blessed One is benevolent and compassionate towards living beings – the bounty of his merits will never be effaced. Now you have attained the fruits of Buddhahood; respected by the Triple World, the deities and immortal sages all honour you.”
  All the bhikṣus were overjoyed, made their obeisance and left.
  Notes:
[1] These are the treasures of the cakravartin (wheel tuning) king. It is not entirely clear what a “bright-moon” or  “full-moon pearl” 明月珠 is: Yu notes (2013 [105], 70 and notes 39 and 40) it is “jewellery that shines. According to some, it is a kind of diamond; to others, it refers to the eye of the whale.”
[2] The Four Equalities (si deng 四等) or Four Equal States of Mind (si deng xin 四等心) are the apramānas, four states of mind a Buddha manifests to all, later translated as the Four Immeasurable States of Mind (si wuliang xin 四無量心).

Once the Buddha was in Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國) in the village of (Youli 優梨). At that time the bhikṣus, were seated in the lecture hall after their mid-day repast, having a private discussion among themselves, [observing in turn]:
“Human life is extremely short!”
“One cannot expect bodily comfort to last long –  we must all go on to later lives.”
“Deities, people and all living things –  none are born that do not die.”
“The ignorant are parsimonious and greedy, they do not give, and they do not uphold the Way of the scriptures.”
“And they maintain good behaviour has nothing to do with good fortune, and that bad behaviour does not lead to serious misfortune!”
“Further they indulge their desires and act as they please, bringing down all manner of evil on themselves as they turn away from the Buddha’s teachings.”
“Later regret - what use will that be?”
Using his divine ear, the Buddha listened from afar to the bhikṣus’ excellent discussion on impermanence. The World Honoured One promptly rose and went over to the bhikṣus, sat down on a seat, and asked, “What have you been discussing?”
They knelt upright before the Buddha and someone replied, “After our recent meal we got together to discuss how man’s life is gone in a flash and he must then endure later lives.”
They related their discussion as described above.
The World Honoured One exclaimed, “Excellent! Excellent! This is very pleasing! One should leave home to study the Way and make purity one’s aim! It is excellent that you can think on these matters! Bhikṣus! Whether sitting or standing, you ought to keep two things in mind: the first the explication of the scriptures, and the second is meditation.
Would you like to hear some scripture?”
They replied, “Most certainly! We would be delighted to hear it.”
The World Honoured One then said, “In the past there was the ruler of a kingdom called Ju-lie (拘獵), and in his kingdom there was a tree called the Xubohuan tree. Nearly two hundred miles in circumference, roots stretching below to a depth of some three hundred miles; over one thousand miles tall, branches spreading over seven hundred miles in each direction. The tree had five sides: the fruits of the first are eaten by the monarch and his household, the second by the various officials, the third by the masses, the fourth by śramaṇas and ascetics, and the fifth by wild animals. The fruits of this tree are as big as a twenty-pint bottle, their flavour as sweet as honey. It is not guarded, yet no one steals from it. At that time human lifespan was eighty-four thousand years. In all there were but nine types of illness: chills, fevers, hunger, thirst, urgency in urination and defecation, lust, gluttony and the frailty associated with age. Women reached the age of five hundred before they were married.
At that time there was a householder called Alinianmi (阿離念彌) [1] who was immeasurably wealthy. Alinianmi thought to himself, “Human life is incredibly short, none are born that do not die, wealth is not really one’s own, and oftentimes leads to disaster. It is better to give it away bringing succour to the poor. Although worldly glory is enjoyable it doesn’t last long. It is better to leave the family, abandon the filth, take up the pure, and don the kāṣāya (robe) as a śramaṇa.”
He promptly went to the worthy multitudes and accepted the śramaṇa precepts. The ordinary people saw Alinianmi had become a śramaṇa, and several thousand, on hearing his sagely teachings became aware of impermanence, understanding that whatever flourishes will decline and whatsoever exists will cease to do so and only the Way is of value, became śramaṇas and followed his teachings.
Alinianmi explicated the scriptures for his disciples saying, “Human life is extremely short, gone in flash, inconstant; when you abandon this body, you will endure further lives. None are born that do not die, how can you get to endure? Thus you must put an end to any parsimonious or greedy inclinations and give to the poor. Restrain your feelings and take a hold of your desires, and do not commit any wicked deed. When humans are in the world their life flows by very swiftly; human life is like the dew on the grass in the morning, gone in an instant. Human life is like this, how can you get to endure? Human life is like the froth which rises up when rain falls and instantly dissipates. Life’s flow passes even more swiftly than this froth. Human life is like the lightning flash which accompanies a thunderstorm and instantly dissipates. Life’s flow passes more swiftly than lightning. Human life is like raising water by beating it with a stick; once the stick has gone, the water comes back down. Life’s flow passes more swiftly than the water comes back down. Human life is like fat poured on the flames in a brazier, burned away in an instant. Life flows by more swiftly than the fat burns away. Human life is like the warp threads on a loom that gradually wear out and disappear. One’s allotted lifespan, reduced day by day and night by night, is just like this. Worries are many and suffering multifarious, how can you get to endure? Human life is like an ox being led to the marketplace for slaughter, each step he takes bringing him nearer to his death. Each day that passes for a human is like a step taken by that ox. Life flows away just as quick as this. Human life is like water pouring down the mountainside, day and night it flows so swiftly without stopping for a moment. Human life passes just as quickly as this, as day and night we hasten ceaselessly towards death. In the human world, life is filled with constant suffering and many worries, but human life is difficult to obtain and for this reason you should uphold the True Way; maintain and practice the scriptures and rules, do not go against them! Give to the poor! No human born in this world can avoid death.”
Alinianmi instructed his disciples like this and went on, “I gave up thoughts of lust, anger, ignorance, song and dance, sleep and perversity, and aimed at purity of mind. I distanced myself from desire and eschewed wicked behaviours; within I cleansed my mind of defilements and I removed all external thoughts. I observed the good without rejoicing and encountered the bad without being troubled; suffering and pleasure were all the same to me, I had purified my behaviour. My mind did not waiver and I attained the Fourth Dhyāna. With kindness (maitrī) I taught and converted humans and other beings, causing those who understood the good Way to ascend and be born in the Heavens. I took pity on and had compassion (karuṇā) for them and feared their descent into wickedness. I have experienced the Fourth Dhyāna and all the formless concentrations; there is nothing I do not understand and my mind is filled with joy. I use what I had learned to teach and convert the ten thousand beings causing them to understand the profound Law and concentrate on Buddhist matters. Should there be one who achieves, I surely experience the helper’s joy (muditā). I nurture and protect the ten thousand things with impartiality (upekṣā) as I do my own body. I put these four things [2] into practice and my mind was corrected and gained equanimity. What I like does not please me nor does what I dislike perturb me; regardless of what my eye sees, coarse or pleasing, what my ears hear, praises or insults, aromas I smell foul, enticing or unpleasant, and sensations I feel, delicate and smooth or coarse and rough, that which would gratify my desires or run contrary to my wishes, I remain indifferent to them all. I kept the six behaviours [3] and through them have reached the Supreme, Perfect Awakening. You should all also practice these six types of behaviour and thereby attain the Way of One who ‘Responds to the True’ (arhat).”
Alinianmi was the most respected teacher among all the sages of the Three Realms, his wisdom was penetrating, no depths were not illuminated by his intelligence. His disciples if yet to achieve the Way of One who ‘Responds to the True’ (arhat) were born in the Heavens at the end of their lives. Those who fixed their mind on quietude and made stillness their aim, valuing dhyāna concentration, were all born in the Brahmā heavens [in the Realm of Form], those next in attainment were born in Transformed by Sound Heaven (Paranirmitavaśavartin), next in the Heaven of Unrestrained Joy (Nirmāṇarati), next in the Tuṣita Heaven, next in Yāma’s Heaven, next in the Heaven of the Thirty Three (Trāyastriṃśa), next in the First Heaven [of the Realm of Desire, the Heaven of the Four Deva Kings (Cāturmahārājika)][4], and next were born in the human world in a clan of princes and nobles. Lofty behaviour results in a lofty position, low behaviour results in low status. Poverty and wealth, high status or low, a long life, or a premature end, all are dependent on one’s conduct in past lives, and those who upheld Aranemi’s rules never suffered in vain.
The Buddha said, “Alinianmi was me. The śramaṇas did their utmost to progress and were able to cast off the suffering associated with the worries over birth, old age, sickness and death and attain the liberation of the Great Way of One who ‘Responds to the True’. Those who could maintain all the conduct attained the Way of the non-returner, once-returner, or stream enterer. Oh wise ones! Think deeply on the impermanence of human life, it is gone in a flash! It only lasts one hundred years, and some do not even get that! In that one hundred years, in all one passes through three hundred time periods, one hundred springs, summers and winters; thus we pass through one thousand two hundred months as spring, summer and winter periods as each have four hundred months; thus we pass through thirty-six thousand days as spring has twelve thousand days and the summer heat and winter cold each have twelve thousand days. In that one hundred years, each day one dines twice, so we experience seventy-two thousand meals, twenty-four thousand meals for the days of each spring, summer and winter – and we must subtract the time when as an infant one was still being breastfed and was not yet taking meals and on unexpected occasions some preoccupation prevented one taking a meal, perhaps sickness, perhaps fury or resentment, perhaps one was meditating, or fasting, or perhaps when was one was impoverished and did not have anything to eat, as all these are included in the seventy-two thousand meals. In that one hundred years we must subtract fifty years for when asleep, and ten for when an infant, ten for when ill and twenty for when agitated and anxious about family matters and [it turns out] human life is only ten years of happiness!”
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “I have already explained human life, how it is measured in terms of years, months, days and meals. What I ought to explain to you bhikṣus, I have already explained, and I have accomplished what I sought to do in my entreaties to you. You bhikṣus must now accomplish your aspirations. You should treat your secluded retreat in the mountains like a royal shrine, recite the scriptures and contemplate the Way without slacking.  Those who seek gratification will all regret it later!”
  When the Buddha had finished explicating the scriptures the bhikṣus were without exception filled with joy, made obeisance before the Buddha then left.

Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國), at his monastery in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu 祇樹), among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada. As the mealtime approached the bhikṣus took their alms bowls and went into the town to beg for food, but it was not yet mid-day, and a thought occurred to one of them who suggested, “As we have reached town really early, we could go to the lecture hall of those heretical brahmins and sit a while!”     
They all agreed saying, “Let’s do it!”
And off they went and exchanged greetings with the brahmins and sat down. The brahmins were right in the middle of a dispute among themselves. They had tied themselves into knots which they could not untie and their discussions had descended into mutual criticism and enmity. [They accused one another thus:]
“We know out methods are the right ones, what kind of methods are yours?”
“Our understanding conforms with the Way, yours does not!”
“Our ways can be put into practice: yours are impossible to trust. What ought to be at the fore you relegate to the back and what ought to be at the back, on the contrary, you bring to the fore!”
“Much of what you say about the law is wrong and unequal to difficult tasks.”
“You are unable to understand our explanations. Your understanding is vacuous, there is absolutely nothing of substance in your theories, when pressed how do you respond?”
In response they deployed their tongues as weapons, and repaid each poisonous remark threefold. All the bhikṣus heard them say these wicked words and thought badly of their arguments, seeing no merit in any of them. So they arose from their seats and proceeded to Śrāvastī in search of food. Once they had eaten and stored away their alms bowls they returned to Jeta’s Grove and made obeisance to the Buddha, then sat to one side and recounted what they had seen, and wondering when these brahmins who study so diligently would understand. The Buddha said to the bhikṣus, “It is not only in this era that these heretics have been ignorant and benighted. Long ago in the very distant past, on this continent of Jambudvīpa (Yanfuti 閻浮提) there was a king called Mirror Face (Jingmian 鏡面). He was able to recite the Buddha’s important scriptures and the things he understood were as numerous as sands in the Ganges. Most of his ministers and subjects did not recite [the Buddhist scriptures] but rather carried lesser works chained to their belts. They placed their trust in the brightness of the glow-worm’s light and regarded with suspicion the far-reaching rays of the sun and moon. [The King had the idea of] using blind men to explain to his subjects hoping to encourage them to abandon traversing the turbid waters [of the secular world] and to travel the great oceans [of the Buddhist teachings]. He ordered envoys to travel the kingdom and bring anyone born blind them to the gates to his palace. An official received his orders and carried them out bringing all the kingdom’s blind to the palace. He reported that the blind had arrived and were now outside the palace and the King commanded, “Lead them away and show them an elephant.”
The official attended to the King’s order and led those blind men to an elephant and leading them by the hand showed it to them. One blind man grasped his foot, one his tail, one the base of his tail, one his belly, one his flank, one his back, one his ear, one his tusk and one his trunk. The blind argued with one another each maintaining his stance conformed with reality and the others were all wrong. The official lead them back to the King who asked them, “Did you encounter the elephant?”
They replied, “We did.”
The King asked, “What was it like?” 
The one who had grasped a foot replied, “Wise Monarch! An elephant is like a lacquered cylinder of bamboo.”
The one who had grasped the tail reported that it was like a broom; the one who had grasped the base of the tail reported that it was like a staff; the one who had grasped the belly reported that it was like a drum; the one who had grasped the flank reported that it was like a wall; the one who had grasped the back reported that it was like a high table; the one who had grasped the ear reported that it was like a winnowing basket; the one who had grasped the head reported that it was like a ladle; the one who had grasped the tusk reported that it was like a horn. The one who had grasped the trunk replied, “Wise Monarch! An elephant is like an enormous rope.”
Those standing before the King started arguing saying, “Great Monarch! The elephant is how I described it!”
King Mirror Face laughed at them and said, “Blind men! Blind men! You are just like those who have not encountered the Buddha’s scriptures!”
And then he spoke this verse:
“Now all those sightless men,
Each think he tells the truth;
They each saw just one part,
Yet argue over the whole!”
He also said, “One who only pays attention to lesser books does not appreciate the boundless nature of the Buddha’s scriptures nor the lofty nature of his unobscured truth; he is like the sightless.”
At this both senior and junior monks began to chant the Buddhist scriptures.
The Buddha told the bhikṣus, “King Mirror Face was me. The blind were those brahmins in the lecture hall. Those ignoramuses, blind to reality, argued. Today’s argument was also benighted and they argued for nothing.”
At this time the Buddha picked up this scroll and explained to his disciples, “By explicating this Yizu jing for later generations you will ensure my scriptures last a long time.
  In thinking your profundities correct, and others just don’t get them,
You cling to your stupidity [causing] daily outflows - when will you ever be enlightened?
Being without the Way, yet convinced you know it all,
Confused, you’ll fail to act correctly - when will you ever attain liberation?
  In constantly regarding one’s own behaviour best,
Thinking your own views and conduct beyond compare,
You’ve already fallen, tied to the five earthly abodes,
Self-regarding, believing your conduct superior to others’.
  Embrace and abide in ignorance, and regard the good from afar,
Such perverse learning will surely obstruct your crossing.
Whatever you see and whatever you hear consider all carefully,
Although you uphold the precepts don’t maintain that’s the only way.
  Observe the worlds conduct, but don’t just follow,
Though the thought is clever, the conduct may not be.
If your conduct matches theirs you respectfully approve,
Don’t think like that or you won’t go beyond.
  This is the way to sever and bring about your end -
Discard thought and attain it through conduct alone.
You won’t arrive at wisdom thinking you have understanding,
Whatever you see and whatever you hear, only conduct matters.
  You must desire nothing at all，
Or birth will follow upon birth, coming together then parting，
With absolutely nowhere to abide.
Focus only on the dharma and gain the correct cessation！
  If you think and act on what you see and hear,
You consider unsound views that should have been paid no heed.
If you consider the dharma with wisdom, desire will be seen as desire
And from this insight worldly emptiness can be relinquished.
  If there is nothing, where will you abide?
Fundamentally, practice the dharma and seek true meaning.
Just keep the precepts - you are not yet wise
Only one who has gone beyond will not be reborn."

His intentions were unblemished and his conduct pure, he relied only the Three Honoured Ones and accepted and studied the Buddhist scriptures intensively, and calm of mind he maintained morality. He carefully observed man’s origins, born from original non-being. The primordial pneumas are made up of [four types]: the strong makes earth, the soft makes water, the warm makes fire and the active makes wind, these four combine and the spirit is engendered [1]. Those of greatest intelligence are able to achieve awakening and put an end to desire. By emptying the mind, they return their spirit to original non-being. So the Bodhisattva made a vow saying, “I will enlighten those of my fellows who are not aware that the spirit relies on these four elements to be established and that those of great humaneness will become a divinity, those with lesser humaneness will become a person, and those with a multitude of defilements and disordered conduct will become the type of living being which wriggles or flies. The body you receive is dependent on your conduct, and there are myriad forms it can take. Both consciousness and primordial pneumas are subtle and difficult to perceive; in form they do not even have the thickness of a strand of silk [2] or hair—who is able grasp them? That being the case, when they are released from their old body they are endowed with a new one, from start to finish without end.”
 So did the King explain to his officials how the numinous spirit transforms into temporary bodies as it cycles through the Five Mires [3] forever. But the benighted are difficult to awaken and they still had doubts and someone asked, “If the body dies and the spirit lives on in a different body then why, as we are so many, it is so rare one has knowledge of a past life?”
The King said, “How can you understand the events of past lives if you have failed to examine the beginning? Who can see the spirit’s transformations if your observations cannot discern what they now lack?”
One day the King found himself unoccupied. He went out his private doorway alone, dressed in coarse clothing. He went up to an old shoe-mender and said in jest, “Who is the happiest in this land?”
The old man replied, “That would be our King!”
The King asked, “How so?”
The old man said, “All the officials attend him respectfully and the common folk pay him tribute. He does whatever he pleases; is this not happiness?”
The King said, “Indeed it is as you say!” 
Then he plied him with wine until he became insensible, then carried him into the palace and said to his principal consort, “This old shoe-maker told me, ‘The King is happy,’ and now I’m going to play a joke on him. I’m going to dress him in royal garb and make him listen to royal business, so don’t be surprised.”
His wife said, “As you wish.”
The next day he sobered up and the concubines went along with the plan saying, “While Your Majesty was very drunk, quite a backlog of matters which need your attention accumulated. You ought to hold court and examine these matters thoroughly and deal with them fairly.”
His ministers urged him to settle various issues, and he was bewildered and disorientated. The court historian recorded his errors and the nobles and officials debated his shortcomings. After sitting on the throne all day his entire body ached with fatigue, and his food no longer tasted sweet, so he grew thinner and weaker by the day.
The palace women, still pretending, said, “Great Majesty’s splendour is not as it was, what’s the matter?”
He replied, “I dreamed I was an aged shoe-mender, struggling in my search for food, really indescribable! That’s why I got a headache.”
Those around him all smirked to themselves. He could not sleep and tossed and turned all night and said to himself, “Am I the aged shoe-mender? Am I really the Son of Heaven? [4] If I am, how come my skin is so rough? And if I am really an old shoe-maker, how come I’m in the royal palace? I’m so confused I’m not seeing straight! I’m in two bodies and I’m not clear which is the real one!”
The concubines, keeping up the pretence, said, “Great Majesty is unhappy, we are going to lay on some entertainment to cheer you up.”
They plied him with wine and he became seriously and insensibly drunk, then they dressed him in his old clothes and sent him back to his crude bed. When he sobered up, he saw he was in his mean abode in his shabby clothes as of old, aching in every bone in his body as if he had been beaten by a cudgel. Several days later the King came to visit him again and the old man said, “Previously I drank your wine and got drunk to the point that I abandoned all reason and became totally confused and insensible. I’ve only just sobered up! I dreamed I was a ruler having to settle and investigate all kinds of government business. The court historian recorded my errors, and the officials debated my shortcomings. I was terrified and anxious and every bone in my body ached as if I had received a beating that I didn’t deserve. If it is like this in a dream, what must it be like to actually be a king? What I said the other day is certainly incorrect.”
The King returned to his palace and discussed this with his officials but their laughter grated on his ears. The King said to his officials, “This person experienced different things in the same body and didn’t know who he was – how much more difficult will it be to comprehend when you abandoned your old body in one era and received a new body in another and experienced myriad difficulties - thrashings by demons, the hardships of disease and unpleasantness. Isn’t it going to be really difficult to understand the transformations of the spirit which resulted in a particular body in a particular place? The scriptures state, ‘A fool harbouring many wicked thoughts wanting to understand the spirit is like a blind man in the dark looking up to observe the stars and the moon – he can exhaust himself in trying until he loses his teeth to age; will he ever be able to see them?’”           
Thereupon the officials and common folk of the realm began to understand that the spirit unites with the primordial pneumas and at the end begins anew, in an endless cycle, and believed that life and death, disaster and good fortune are dependent on conduct.”
The Buddha told the bhikṣus:
“At that time the King was me.”
  Such is the extensive, intelligent, limitless wisdom practiced by the Bodhisattva.

Once the Buddha was in the city of Śrāvastī (Shewei guo 舍衛國), at his monastery in Jeta’s Grove (Qishu 祇樹), among the gardens of Anāthapiṇḍada. The Buddha told the bhikṣus, “If you practice virtue and uphold all the good behaviours you will certainly attain great good fortune. Like a farmer who has long worked fertile land, if the soil has been tilled with care and rain has moistened the ground at appropriate times, seeds planted in the correct season will germinate, and if the weeds are removed, barring a natural disaster, why fear not reaping the harvest? In former times, in a previous life before I had attained buddhahood my mind was enlarged by love and I sought to relieve the distress of all living beings, like a mother tending to her new-born babe. I was like this for seven years and the merit generated from my humaneness was such that when my life came to an end my soul ascended and I became holy sovereign named Brahmā (Fanmo 梵摩). In that divine position I underwent seven creations and seven destructions of the heavens and the earth. Just before a destruction I ascended the fifteenth Heaven of Lesser Purity [1], and after that I began again, and once again returned to the Brahmā Heaven where, pure and without desire, I naturally stayed. Later I descended to take up the position of Lord of the Trāyastriṃśa thirty-six times [2]. I lived in the Palace of the Seven Treasures, where my food and drink, clothing and music arose spontaneously. Then I returned to the world as a Flying Emperor (cakravartin), with my entourage comprising the Seven Treasure: the first, a purple gold wheel; the second, a bright-moon divine pearl; the third, a flying white elephant; the fourth, a red-black horse with a vermillion mane; the fifth, a jade maiden wife; the sixth, a treasury minister [3], and the seventh, a sagely prime minister. I dealt with eighty-four thousand matters. As king I had one thousand sons, they were all upright and pure, humane, compassionate and brave, one of them was worth one thousand others. As king I governed using the Five Constant Teachings [4] and was never unjust to the common people: first, this king was compassionate and did not kill, and his kindness reached all living beings; second, he was pure, deferential and did not steal, and would sacrifice himself to save others; third, he was chaste, and as he  was not licentious and had no use for the passions; fourth, he was honest and trustworthy, he did not cheat, and his speech was without flowery adornment; fifth, he was filial and sober, and his conduct was without anything contaminating. At this time prisons were not established and the whip and staff were not applied, the winds and rains came at the appropriate times and the Five Grains ripened in abundance. Calamities did not arise and the world experienced a period of Great Peace [5]. The peoples of the Four Continents lead one another to the Way, believing that good actions brought good fortune and that bad actions brought serious misfortune. When they died, they all ascended to the heavens and none entered the Three Evil Paths [6].
  The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “In former times in a previous life I practiced the Four Equal States of Mind [7], and after seven years of meritorious conduct I ascended to be the holy sovereign Brahmā, and then descended to be the Lord Śakra (Tiandi Shi 天帝釋), then again I returned to the world of men as a Flying Emperor and governed over the Four Continents for several thousand years. My merits accumulated and my virtue was complete, all the evils were quietened and extinguished; all the good came together and I dwelt in the world as the Buddha, my words and deeds the most respected in the Three Realms.”
The bhikṣus heard this scripture and were overjoyed. The bowed in obeisance to the Buddha and left.
  Such is the extensive, intelligent, limitless wisdom practiced by the Bodhisattva.
  Notes:
[1] Parīttaśubhadeva is the first of the third dhyāna heavens.
[2] Trāyastriṃśa Heaven (daolitian 忉利天), or the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, is ruled over by Śakra, and is the second heaven of the Realm of Desire.
[3] These are the treasures of the cakravartin (wheel-turning) king. It is not entirely clear what a “bright-moon” or  “full-moon pearl” 明月珠 is: Yu notes (2013 [105], 70 and notes 39 and 40) it is “jewellery that shines. According to some, it is a kind of diamond; to others, it refers to the eye of the whale.” The usual list of seven contains a military official.
[4] This may be an attempt to suggest parallels between traditional Chinese moral qualities and the Buddhist five precepts (pañca-śīla). 
[5] ‘Great Peace’, taiping 太平,  is a period of political stability and social harmony brought about by good rulership, see Introduction to Hendrischke 2006. 
[6] The Three Evil Paths are rebirth as in hell, a hungry ghost or an animal.
[7] The Four Equalities (si deng 四等) or Four Equal States of Mind (si deng xin 四等心) are the apramānas, four states of mind a Buddha manifests to all, later translated as the Four Immeasurable States of Mind (si wuliang xin 四無量心). They are loving-kindness (maitrī; ci 慈), compassion (karuṇā; bei 悲), sympathetic joy (muditā; xi 喜), and equanimity (upekṣā; she 捨)."
