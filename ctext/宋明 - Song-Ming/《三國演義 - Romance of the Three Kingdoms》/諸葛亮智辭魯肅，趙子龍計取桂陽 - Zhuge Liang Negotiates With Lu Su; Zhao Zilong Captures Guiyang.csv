卻說周瑜見孔明襲了南郡，又聞他襲了荊襄，如何不氣？氣傷箭瘡，半晌方甦。眾將再三勸解。瑜曰：「若不殺諸葛村夫，怎息我心中怨氣？程德謀可助我攻打南郡，定要奪還東吳。」,"Zhou Yu's anger at seeing that his rival, Zhuge Liang, had surprised Nanjun, and at hearing the same news of Jingzhou and Xiangyang, was but natural. And this sudden fit of rage caused his wound to reopen. However, he soon recovered. All his officers besought him to accept the situation.But he said, ""What but the death of that bumpkin Zhuge Liang will assuage my anger? If Cheng Pu can but aid me in an attack on Nanjun, I can certainly restore it to the South Land."""
正議問，魯肅至。瑜謂之曰：「吾欲起兵與劉備，諸葛亮共決雌雄，復奪城池。子敨幸助我。」魯肅曰：「不可。方今與曹操相持，尚未分成敗；主公現攻合淝不下；如若自家互相吞併，倘曹兵乘虛而來，其勢危矣。況劉玄德舊曾曹操相厚，若逼得緊急，獻了城池，一同攻打東吳，如之奈何？」瑜曰：「吾等用計策，損兵馬，費錢糧，他去圖現成，豈不可恨！」肅曰：「公瑾且耐。容某親見玄德，將理來說他。若說不通，那時動兵未遲。」諸將曰：「子敬之言甚善。」,"Soon Lu Su came in, to whom Zhou Yu said, ""I simply must fight Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang till it is decided which shall have the upper hand. I must also recapture the cities. Perhaps you can assist me.""""It cannot be done,"" replied Lu Su. ""We are now at grips with Cao Cao, and victory or defeat is undecided. Our lord has not been successful in overcoming Hefei. Do not fight near home, or it will be like people of the same household destroying each other. Should Cao Cao take advantage of this position to make a sudden descent, we should be in a parlous condition. Further, you must remember that Liu Bei and Cao Cao are united by the bonds of old friendship. If the pressure becomes too great, Liu Bei may relinquish these cities, offer them to Cao Cao, and join forces with him to attack the south. That would be a real misfortune.""""I cannot help being angry,"" said Zhou Yu, ""to think that we should have used our resources for their benefit. They get all the advantage.""""Well, let me go and see Liu Bei and talk reason to him. If I can arrive at no understanding, then attack at once.""""Excellent proposal!"" cried all present."
於是魯肅引從者徑投南郡來，到城下叫門。趙雲出問。肅曰：「我要見劉玄德有話說。」雲答曰：「吾主與軍師在荊州城中。」肅遂不入南郡，徑奔荊州。見旌旗整列，軍容甚盛，肅暗羨曰：「孔明真非常人也！」軍士報入城中，說魯子敬要見。孔明令大開城門，接肅入衙。講禮畢，分賓主而坐。茶罷，肅曰：「吾主吳侯，與都督公瑾，教某再三申意皇叔。前者，操引百萬之眾，名下江南，實欲來圖皇叔；幸得東吳殺退曹兵，救了皇叔，所有荊州九郡，合當歸於東吳。今皇叔用詭計，奪占荊襄，使江東空費錢糧軍馬，而皇叔安受其利，恐於理未順。」,"So Lu Su, with his escort, went away to Nanjun to carry out his proposal and try to arrange matters. He reached the city wall and summoned the gate, whereat Zhao Zilong came out to speak with him.""I have something to say to Liu Bei,"" said he. ""I wish to see him.""""My lord and Zhuge Liang are in Jingzhou,"" was the reply.Lu Su turned away and hasted to Jingzhou. He found the walls bedecked with flags and everything in excellent order. In his heart he admired the sight, and thought what an able person was the commander of that army.The guards reported his arrival, and Zhuge Liang ordered them to throw wide the gate. Lu Su was led to the government house and, after the usual exchange of salutes, Zhuge Liang and his visitor took their respective seats.Having finished the tea, Lu Su said, ""My master, Marquis Sun Quan, and the commander of his army, Zhou Yu, have sent me to lay before the Imperial Uncle their views. When Cao Cao led his huge host southward, he gave out that it was for the conquest of the South Land. But really his intention was to destroy Liu Bei. Happily our army was able to repulse that mighty host and so saved him. Wherefore Jingzhou with its nine territories of forty-two counties ought to belong to us. But by a treacherous move, your master has occupied Jingzhou and Xiangyang, so that we have spent our treasure in vain and our armies have fought to no purpose. The Imperial Uncle has reaped the benefits to the full. This is not as it should be."""
孔明曰：「子敬乃高明之士，何故亦出此言？常言道：『物必歸主。』荊襄九郡，非東吳之地，乃劉景升之基業。吾主固景升之弟也。景升雖亡，其子尚在。以叔輔姪，而取荊州，有何不可？」肅曰：「若果係公子劉琦占據，尚有可解；今公子在江夏，須不在這裏。」孔明曰：「子敬欲見公子乎？」便命左右請公子出來。只見兩侍者從屏風後扶出劉琦。琦謂肅曰：「病軀不能施禮，子敬勿罪。」魯肅吃了一驚，默然無語，良久言曰：「公子若不在，便如何？」孔明曰：「公子在一日，守一日；若不在，別有商議。」肅曰：「若公子不在，須將城池還我東吳。」孔明曰：「子敬之言是也。」遂設宴相待。,"Zhuge Liang replied, ""Lu Su, you are a man of high intelligence. Why do you hold such language? You know the saying that all things return to their owner. These places have never belonged to the South Land, but were of the patrimony of Liu Biao, and though he is dead, his son remains. Should not the uncle assist the nephew to recover his own? Could my master have refrained?""""If the nephew Liu Qi, the rightful heir, had occupied these cities, there would have been something to say. But he is at Jiangxia and not here.""""Would you like to see him?"" said Zhuge Liang.At the same time he ordered the servants to request Liu Qi to come. Thereupon Liu Qi at once appeared, supported by two attendants.Addressing Lu Su, Liu Qi said, ""I am too weak to perform the correct ceremonies. I pray you pardon me, Lu Su.""Lu Su said not a word. He was too much taken aback. However, he recovered himself presently and said, ""But if the heir had not been here, what then?""""The heir is living but from day to day. Should he go, then —-there will be something to talk about.""""Should he die, then you ought to return these cities to us.""""You state the exact facts,"" said Zhuge Liang.Then a banquet was prepared."
宴罷，肅辭出城，連夜歸寨，具言前事。瑜曰：「劉琦正青春年少，如何便得他死？這荊州何日得還？」肅曰：「都督放心。只在魯肅身上，務要討荊，襄還東吳。」瑜曰：「子敬有何高見？」肅曰：「吾觀劉琦過於酒色，病入膏肓，現今面色羸瘦，氣喘嘔血；不過半年，其人必死。那時往取荊州，劉備須無得推故。」,"The banquet over, Lu Su took his leave. He hastened back to his own camp and gave Zhou Yu an account of his mission.""But what is there for us in the chance of Liu Qi's death?"" said Zhou Yu. ""He is in his very first youth. When will these places fall to us?""""Rest content, General. Let me guarantee the return of these places.""""But how can you?"" asked Zhou Yu.""Liu Qi has indulged too freely in wine and women. He is a wreck and rotten to the core, miserably emaciated and panting for breath. I will not give him half a year's life. Then I will go to Liu Bei, and he will be unable to deny the request."""
周瑜猶自忿氣未消，忽孫權遣使至。瑜令請入。使曰：「主公圍合淝，累戰不捷。特令都督收回大軍，且撥兵赴合淝相助。」周瑜只得班師回柴桑養病，令程普部領戰船士卒，來合淝聽孫權調用。,"But Zhou Yu was still unmollified.Suddenly came a messenger from Sun Quan, who said, ""Our lord is laying siege to Hefei but in several battles has had no victory. He now orders you to withdraw from here and go to Hefei to help him.""Thereupon Zhou Yu marched back to Chaisang. Having reached home, he began to give attention to the recovery of his health. He sent Cheng Pu with the marine and land forces to Hefei ready for Sun Quan's call."
卻說劉玄德自得荊州，南郡，襄陽，心中大喜，商議久遠之計。忽見一人上廳獻策，視之，乃伊籍也。玄德感其舊日之恩，十分相敬，坐而問之。籍曰：「要知荊州久遠之計，何不求賢士以問之？」玄德曰：「賢士安在？」籍曰：「荊，襄馬氏兄弟五人，並有才名。幼者名謖，字幼常。其最賢者，眉間有白毛，名良，字季常。鄉里為之諺曰：『馬氏五常，白眉最良。』公何不求此人而與之謀？」,"Liu Bei was exceedingly well satisfied with the possession of his new region, and his thoughts turned to more ambitious schemes. Then a certain man came to him to suggest a plan. This man was Yi Ji and, remembering the kindly feeling of other days, Liu Bei received him most graciously.When Yi Ji was seated, and his host had asked what he proposed, he said, ""You wish for a plan to accomplish yet greater deeds. Why not seek wise people and ask them?""""Where are these wise people to be found?"" asked Liu Bei.Yi Ji replied, ""In this region there is a certain family named Ma, five brothers, all of whom are known as men of ability. The youngest is called Ma Su. The ablest is Ma Liang, who has white hairs in his eyebrows, and the villagers have a little rhyming couplet that means 'There are five sons in the family Ma, but white eyebrows is the best of them.' You should get this man to draw up a plan for you."""
玄德遂命請之。馬良至，玄德優禮相待，請問保守荊，襄之策。良曰：「荊襄四面受敵之地，恐不可久守。可令公子劉琦於此養病，招諭舊人以守之，就表奏公子為荊州刺史，以安民心；然後南征武陵，長沙，桂陽，零陵四郡，積收錢糧，以為根本。此久遠之計也。」,"So Liu Bei told them to request his presence. Ma Liang came and was received with great respect.He was asked to suggest a plan for the security of the newly acquired region, and he said, ""Attacked as it is on all sides, this region is not one in which one is permanently secure. You should let Liu Qi remain here till he is recovered from his present illness, but the actual protection of the place is to be placed in the hands of trusty friends. Obtain an edict appointing him Imperial Protector of Jingzhou, and the people will be content. Then conquer Wuling, Changsha, Guiyang, and Lingling. And with the resources you will thus acquire, you will have the means for further plans. That should be your policy."""
玄德大喜，遂問：「四郡當先取何郡？」良曰：「湘江之西，零陵最近，可先取之。次取武陵。然後湘江之東取桂陽。長沙為後。」玄德遂用馬良為從事，伊籍副之；請孔明商議送劉琦回襄陽，替雲長回荊州；便調兵取零陵，差張飛為先鋒，趙雲合後，孔明，玄德為中軍，人馬一萬五千；留雲長守荊州；糜竺，劉封守江陵。,"""Which of the four territories should be first taken?"" asked Liu Bei.""The nearest, Lingling, which lies in the west of River Xiang. The next is Wuling, and after these the other two.""Ma Liang was given an appointment as Imperial Protector Assistant, with Yi Ji as his second. Then Liu Bei consulted Zhuge Liang about sending Liu Qi to Xiangyang, so that Guan Yu could be free to return. Next they made preparations to attack Lingling, and Zhang Fei was to lead the van. Zhao Zilong was to guard the rear, while Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were to command the main body. A fifteen thousand troops were left to hold Jingzhou. Mi Zhu and Liu Feng were left to guard Jiangling."
卻說零陵太守劉度，聞玄德軍馬到來，乃與其子劉賢商議。賢曰：「父親放心。他雖有張飛，趙雲之勇，我本州上那邢道榮，力敵萬人，可以抵對。」劉度遂命劉賢與邢道榮引兵萬餘，離城三十里，依山靠水下寨。探馬報說：「孔明自引一軍到來。」道榮便引軍出戰。兩陣對圓，道榮出馬，手使開山大斧，厲聲高叫：「反賊安敢侵我境界！」只見對陣中，一簇黃旗。門旗開處，推出一輛四輪車。車中端坐一人，頭戴綸巾，身披鶴氅，手執羽扇，用扇招邢道榮曰：「吾乃南陽諸葛孔明也。曹操引百萬之眾，被吾略施小計，殺得片甲不回。汝等豈可與我對敵？我今來招安汝等，何不早降？」,"The Governor of Lingling was Liu Du. When danger thus threatened, he called in his son Liu Xian, and they discussed the case.The son was very self-confident and said to his father, ""Have no anxiety. They may have the known and famous warriors, Zhang Fei and Zhao Zilong, but we have our leader, Xing Daorong, who is match for any number of men. He can withstand them.""So Liu Xian, with the famous leader, was entrusted with the defense. At the head of a full ten thousand troops, they made a camp about ten miles from the city, with the shelter of hills and a river. Their scouts brought news that Zhuge Liang was close at hand with one army. Xing Daorong decided to check his advance and went forth to oppose him. When both sides were arrayed, Xing Daorong rode to the front. In his hand he held a battle-ax called Cleaver of Mountains.In a mighty voice he cried, ""Rebels, how comes it that you have dared to enter our territory?""From the center of the opposing army, where appeared a cluster of yellow flags, there came out a small four-wheeled carriage in which sat, very erect, a certain man dressed in white, with a turban on his head. In one hand he held a feather fan, with which he signed to the warrior to approach.At the same time he said, ""I am Zhuge Liang of Nanyang, whose plans broke up the countless legions of Cao Cao so that nothing of them returned whence they started. How then can you hope to oppose me? I now offer you peace, and it will be well for you to surrender."""
道榮大笑曰：「赤壁鏖兵，乃周郎之謀也，干汝何事，敢來誑語！」輪大斧竟奔孔明。孔明便回車，望陣中走，陣門復閉。道榮直衝殺過來，陣勢急分兩下而走。道榮遙望中央一簇黃旗，料是孔明，乃只望黃旗而趕。抹過山腳，黃旗劄住，忽地中央分開，不見四輪車，只見一將挺矛躍馬，大喝一聲，直取道榮，乃張翼德也。道榮輪大斧來迎，戰不數合，氣力不加，撥馬便走。翼德隨後趕來，喊聲大震，兩下伏兵齊出。道榮捨死衝過，前面一員大將，攔住去路，大叫：「認得常山趙子龍否？」,"Xing Daorong laughed derisively, saying, ""Their defeat was owing to the plan of Zhou Yu. You had nothing to do with it. How dare you try to deceive me?""So saying he swung up his battle-ax and came running toward Zhuge Liang. But Zhuge Liang turned his carriage and retired within the lines which closed up behind him. Xing Daorong came rushing on. As he reached the array, the troops fell away on both sides and let him enter. Well within he looked round for his chief opponent. Seeing a yellow flag moving along quietly, he concluded that Zhuge Liang was with it and so followed it. When the flag had gone over the shoulder of a hill it stopped. Then suddenly as if the earth had opened and swallowed it up, the four-wheeled carriage disappeared, while in its place came a ferocious warrior, with a long serpent halberd in his hand and mounted on a curvetting steed. It was Zhang Fei, who dashed at Xing Daorong with a tremendous roar.Nothing daunted, Xing Daorong whirled up his battle-ax and went to meet Zhang Fei. But after four or five bouts, Xing Daorong saw that there was no chance of victory for him, so he turned his horse and ran. Zhang Fei pursued, the air shaking with the thunder of his voice. Then the ambushing troops appeared. Xing Daorong, nothing daunted, rushed into their midst.But in front appeared another warrior barring the way, who called out, ""Do you know me? I am Zhao Zilong of Changshan."""
道榮料敵不過，又無處奔走，只得下馬請降。子龍縛來寨中見玄德，孔明。玄德喝教斬首。孔明急止之，問道榮曰：「汝若與我捉了劉賢，便准你投降。」道榮連聲願往。孔明曰：「你用何法捉他？」道榮曰：「軍師若肯放某回去，某自有巧說。今晚軍師引兵劫寨，某為內應，活捉劉賢，獻與軍師。劉賢既擒，劉度自降矣。」玄德不信其言。孔明曰：「邢將軍非謬言也。」遂放道榮歸。道榮得放回寨，將前事實訴劉賢。賢曰：「如之奈何？」道榮曰：「可將計就計。今夜將兵伏於寨外。寨中虛立旗旛，待孔明來劫寨，就而擒之。」,"Xing Daorong knew that all was over. He could neither fight nor fly. So he dismounted and gave in. He was fettered and taken to camp, where were Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. Liu Bei ordered him out to execution, but Zhuge Liang hastily checked him.""We will accept your submission if you capture Liu Xian for us,"" said Zhuge Liang.The captive accepted the offer without the least hesitation.When Zhuge Liang asked how he intended to do it, he replied, ""If you will set me free, I shall be cunning of speech. If you raid the camp this evening, you will find me your helper on the inside. I will make Liu Xian a prisoner and will hand him over to you. He being captured, his father will surrender at once.""Liu Bei doubted the good faith of the man, but Zhuge Liang said, ""Xing Daorong is not deceiving.""Wherefore Xing Daorong was set free and went back to camp, where he related all that had occurred.""What can we do?"" asked Liu Xian.""We can meet trick with trick. Put soldiers in ambush tonight outside our camp while within everything will appear as usual. When Zhuge Liang comes we shall capture him."""
劉賢依計。當夜二更，果然有一彪軍到寨口，每人各帶草把，一齊放火。劉賢，道榮兩下殺來，放火軍便退，劉賢，道榮，兩軍乘勢追趕，趕了十幾里，軍皆不見。劉賢，道榮大驚，急回本寨，只見火光未滅，寨中突出一將，乃張翼德也。劉賢叫道榮：「不可入寨，卻去劫孔明寨便了。」於是復回軍。走不十里，趙雲引一軍刺斜裏殺出，一槍刺道榮於馬下。劉賢急撥馬奔走，背後張飛趕來，活捉過馬，綁縛見孔明。賢告曰：「邢道榮教某如此，實非本心也。」孔明令釋其縛，與衣穿了，賜酒壓驚，教人送入城說父投降；如其不降，打破城池，滿門盡誅。,"The ambush was prepared. At the second watch an army came out of the darkness and appeared in the gate. Each carried a torch and they began to set fire to all about them. Out dashed Liu Xian and Xing Daorong, and the incendiaries forthwith fled. The two warriors pursued them, but the fugitives ran and then suddenly disappeared at about three miles from the camp.Much surprised the two turned to wend their way back to their own camp. It was still burning for no one had extinguished the flames. Soon from behind them came out Zhang Fei.Liu Xian called out to his companion, saying, ""Do not enter the burning camp, but to go to attack Zhuge Liang's stockade.""Thereupon they turned again, but at a distance of three miles Zhao Zilong and an army suddenly debouched upon their road. Zhao Zilong attacked and slew Xing Daorong by a spear thrust. Liu Xian turned to flee, but Zhang Fei was close upon him and made him prisoner. He was thrown across a horse, bound, and taken to camp.When he saw Zhuge Liang, Liu Xian said, ""The ruse was Xing Daorong's evil counsel. I was forced to follow.""Zhuge Liang ordered them to loose his bonds, had him properly dressed, and gave him wine to cheer him and help him forget his troubles. When he was recovered, he was told to go to his father and persuade him to yield.""And if he does not, the city shall be destroyed and everyone put to death,"" said Zhuge Liang as Liu Xian left."
劉賢回零陵見父劉度，備述孔明之德，勸父投降。度從之，遂於城上豎起降旗，大開城門，齎捧印綬出城，竟投玄德大寨納降。孔明教劉度仍為郡守，其子劉賢赴荊州隨軍辦事。零陵一郡居民，盡皆喜悅。,"Liu Xian returned to the city and told his father these things. Liu Du at once decided to yield and forthwith hoisted the flag of surrender, opened the gates, and went out taking his seal of office with him. He was reappointed to his governorship, but his son was sent to Jingzhou for service with the army.The people of Lingling all rejoiced greatly at the change of rulers."
玄德入城安撫己畢，賞勞三軍，乃問眾將曰：「零陵已取了，桂陽郡何了敢取？」趙雲應曰：「某願往。」張飛奮然出曰：「飛亦願往！」二人相爭。孔明曰：「終是子龍先應，只教子龍去。」張飛不服，定要去取。孔明教拈鬮，拈著的便去。又是子軍拈著。張飛怒曰：,"Liu Bei entered the city, calmed and reassured the people, and rewarded his army.But he at once began to think of the next move and asked for an officer to volunteer to take Guiyang. Zhao Zilong offered, but Zhang Fei vehemently proposed himself for the command of the expedition. So they wrangled and contended.Then said Zhuge Liang, ""Undoubtedly Zhao Zilong was first to volunteer, wherefore he is to go.""Still Zhang Fei opposed and insisted on going. They were told to decide the dispute by drawing lots, and Zhao Zilong drew the winning lot.Zhang Fei was still very angry and grumbled,"
「我並不要人相幫，只獨領三千軍去，穩取城池。」趙雲曰：「某也只領三千軍去。如不得城，願受軍令。」,"""I would not have wanted any helpers: Just three thousand soldiers and I would have done it.""""I also only want three thousand soldiers,"" said Zhao Zilong. ""And if I fail, I am willing to suffer the penalties."""
孔明大喜，責寫軍令狀，選三千精兵付趙雲去。張飛不服，玄德喝退。,"Zhuge Liang was pleased that Zhao Zilong recognized his responsibility so fully, and with the commission he gave Zhao Zilong three thousand of veterans.Though the matter was thus settled, Zhang Fei was discontented and pressed his claim till Liu Bei bade him desist and retire."
趙範拗不過，只得應允。陳應領三千人馬出城迎敵，早望見趙雲領軍來到。陳應列成陣勢，飛馬綽叉而出。趙雲挺槍出馬，責罵陳應曰：「吾主劉玄德，乃劉景升之弟。今輔公子劉琦同領荊州，特來撫民。汝何故迎敵？」陳應罵曰：「我等只服曹丞相，豈順劉備！」趙雲大怒，挺槍驟馬，直取陳應，應撚叉來迎。兩馬相交，戰到四五合，陳應料敵不過，撥馬便走。趙雲追趕。陳應回顧趙雲馬來相近，用飛叉擲去，被趙雲接住，回擲陳應。應急躲過，雲馬早到，將陳應活捉過馬，擲於地下，喝軍士綁縛回寨。敗軍四散奔走。雲入寨叱陳應曰：「量汝安敢敵我！我今不殺汝，放汝回去；說與趙範，早來投降。」,"With his three thousand troops, Zhao Zilong took the road to Guiyang. The Governor, Zhao Fan, soon heard of his approach and hastily called his officers to take counsel. Two of them, Chen Ying and Bao Long, offered to meet the invaders and turn them back.These two warriors belonged to Guiyang and had made themselves famous as hunters. Chen Ying used a ""Flying Fork,"" and Bao Long could draw a bow with such force that he had been known to send an arrow through two tigers. So strong were they, as well as bold.They stood before Zhao Fan and said, ""We will lead the way against Liu Bei.""The Governor replied, ""I know that Liu Bei is of the imperial family, and Zhuge Liang is exceedingly resourceful. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei are very bold. But the commander of this force is Zhao Zilong who, on one occasion, faced a hundred legions of Cao Cao and never blenched. Our small force here cannot stand against such people. We shall have to yield.""""Let me go out to fight,"" said Chen Ying. ""If I cannot capture Zhao Zilong, then you can yield.""The Governor could not resist him and gave his consent. Then Chen Ying, with three thousand troops, went forth. Soon the two armies came within sight of each other. When Chen Ying's army was drawn up, he girded on his flying fork and rode to the front. Zhao Zilong gripped his spear and rode to meet him.Zhao Zilong began to rail at Chen Ying, saying, ""My master is the brother of Liu Biao to whom belonged this land. Now he is supporting his nephew, the heir and son of Liu Biao. Having taken Jingzhou, I am come to soothe and comfort the people here. Why then do you oppose me?""""We are supporters of the Prime Minister Cao Cao and are no followers of your master,"" was the reply.Zhao Zilong, waxing angry, firmly grasped his spear and rode forward. His opponent twirled the flying fork and advanced. The horses met, but after four or five encounters Chen Ying, realizing that there was no hope of victory, turned and fled. Zhao Zilong followed. Suddenly turning, Chen Ying got close to Zhao Zilong and flung the fork. Zhao Zilong deftly caught it and threw it back. Chen Ying dodged away, but Zhao Zilong soon caught him up, seized, dragged him out of the saddle, and threw him to the ground. Then Zhao Zilong called up his soldiers, and they bound the prisoner. Chen Ying was taken to the camp, while his troops scattered and fled.""I thought you would not dare a combat with me,"" said Zhao Zilong to the prisoner when they had returned to camp. ""However, I am not going to put you to death. You are free. But persuade your master to yield."""
陳應謝罪，抱頭鼠竄，回到城中，對趙範盡言其事。範曰：「我本欲降，汝強要戰，以致如此。」遂叱退陳應，齎捧印綬，引十數騎出城投大寨納降。雲出寨迎接，待以賓禮，置酒共飲，納了印綬。酒至數巡，範曰：「將軍姓趙，某亦姓趙。五百年前，合是一家。將軍乃真定人，，某亦真定人，又是同鄉。倘得不棄，結為兄弟，實為萬幸。」雲大喜，各敘年庚。雲與範同年。雲長範四個月，範遂拜雲為兄。二人同鄉，同年，又同姓，十分相得。至晚席散，範辭回城。,"Chen Ying asked pardon, put his hands over his head, and fled like a frightened rat. When he reached his city, he told the Governor all these things.""My original desire was to yield, but you insisted on fighting, and this is what it has brought you to.""So spoke the Governor. He bade Chen Ying begone and then prepared his letter of submission and put up his seal. With a small party, Zhao Fan went out of the city and wended his way to Zhao Zilong's camp. Zhao Zilong received him graciously, offered him wine, and then accepted the seal of office.After the wine had gone round several times, Zhao Fan became talkative, saying, ""General, your surname is the same as mine, and five centuries ago we were one family. You are from Changshan, and so am I. Moreover we are from the same village. If you do not mind, we might swear brotherhood. I should be very happy.""Zhao Zilong was pleased and they compared ages. They were of the same year. However, Zhao Zilong was the elder by four months, and so Zhao Fan made his bow as younger brother. The two men, having so many things in common, were very pleased with each other and seemed fitted to be close friends.At eventide the feast broke up, and the late Governor returned to his dwelling."
次日，範請雲入城安民。雲教軍士休動，只帶五十騎隨入城中。居民執香伏道而接。雲安民畢，趙範邀請入衙飲宴。酒至半酣，範復邀雲入後堂深處，洗盞更酌。雲飲微醉，範忽請一婦人，與雲把酒。子龍見婦人身穿縞素，，有傾國傾城之色，乃問範曰：「此何人也？」範曰：「家嫂樊氏也。」子龍改容敬之。樊氏把盞畢，範令就坐。雲辭謝。樊氏辭歸後堂。雲曰：「賢弟何必煩令嫂舉盃耶？」範笑曰：「中間有個緣故，乞兄勿阻。先兄棄世已三載，家嫂寡居，終非了局，弟常勸其改嫁。嫂曰：『若得三件事兼全之人，我方嫁之：第一要文武雙全，名聞天下；第二要相貌堂堂，威儀出眾；第三要與家兄同姓。』你道天下那得有這般湊巧的？今尊兄堂堂儀表，名震四海，又與家兄同姓，正兮家嫂所言。若不嫌家嫂貌陋，願備嫁資，與將軍為妻，結累世之親，何如？」,"Next day Zhao Fan requested Zhao Zilong to enter the city, where, after Zhao Zilong had assured the people of their safety, he went to a banquet at the state residence. When they had become mellow with wine, the Governor invited Zhao Zilong into the inner quarters, where wine was again served. When Zhao Zilong was a little intoxicated, his host bade a woman come forth and offer a cup of wine to the guest.The woman was dressed entirely in white silk, and her beauty was such as to overthrow cities and ruin states.""Who is she?"" asked Zhao Zilong.""My sister-in-law. She is of the Fan family.""Zhao Zilong at once changed his look and treated her with deference. When she had offered the cup, the host told her to be seated and join the party, but Zhao Zilong declined this addition to the evening, and the lady withdrew.""Why did you trouble your sister-in-law to present wine to me, brother?"" asked Zhao Zilong.""There is a reason,"" said the host smiling. ""I pray you let me tell you. My brother died three years ago and left her a widow. But this cannot be regarded as the end of the story. I have often advised her to marry again, but she said she would only do so if three conditions were satisfied in one man's person. The suitor must be famous for literary grace and warlike exploits, secondly, handsome and highly esteemed and, thirdly, of the same name as our own. Now where in all the world was such a combination likely to be found? Yet here are you, brother, dignified, handsome, and prepossessing, a man whose name is known all over the wide world and of the desired name. You exactly fulfill my sister's ambitions. If you do not find her too plain, I should like her to marry you and I will provide a dowry. What think you of such an alliance, such a bond of relationship?"""
雲聞言大怒而起，厲聲曰：「吾既與汝結為兄弟，汝嫂即吾嫂也，豈可作此亂人倫之事乎！」趙範羞慚滿面，答曰：「我好意相待，如何這般無禮！」遂目視左右，有相害之意。雲已覺，一拳打倒趙範，逕出府門，上馬出城去了。,"But Zhao Zilong rose in anger, shouting, ""As I have just sworn brotherhood with you, is not your sister-in-law my sister-in-law? How could you think of bringing such confusion into the relationship?""Shame suffused Zhao Fan's face, and he said, ""I only thought of being kind to you. Why are you so very rude to me?""Zhao Fan looked right and left to his attendants with murder in his eye. Zhao Zilong raised his fist and knocked him down.Then he strode out of the place, mounted, and rode out of the city."
範急喚陳應，鮑隆商議。應曰：「這人發怒去了，只索與他廝殺。」範曰：「但恐贏他不得。」鮑隆曰：「我兩個詐降到他軍中，太守卻引兵來搦戰，我二人就陣上擒之。」陳應曰：「必須帶些人馬。」龍曰：「五百騎足矣。」,"Zhao Fan at once called in his two generals.Chen Ying said, ""He has gone away in a rage, which means that we shall have to fight him.""""I greatly fear you will lose,"" said Zhao Fan.""We will pretend to be deserters,"" said Bao Long, ""and so get among his soldiers. When you challenge him, we will suddenly catch him.""""We shall have to take some others with us,"" said Chen Ying.""Five hundred troops will be ample,"" said Bao Long."
當夜二人引五百軍逕投趙雲寨來投降。雲已心知其詐，遂教喚入。二將到帳下說：「趙範欲用美人計賺將軍，只等將軍醉了，扶入後堂謀殺，將頭去曹丞相處獻功，如此不仁。某二人見將軍怒出，必連累於某，因此投降。」趙雲佯喜，置酒與二人痛飲。二人大醉，雲乃縛於帳中，擒其手下人問之，果是詐降。雲喚五百軍人，各賜酒食，傳令曰：「要害我者，陳應，鮑龍也；不干眾人之事。汝等聽吾行計，皆有重賞。」眾軍拜謝，將降將陳，鮑二人，當時斬了；卻教五百軍引路，雲引一千軍在後，連夜到桂陽城下叫門。,"So in the night the two men and their followers ran over to Zhao Zilong's camp to desert.Zhao Zilong understood the trick they would play, but he called them in, and they said, ""When Zhao Fan tempted you with that fair lady, he wanted to make you drunk and get you into the private apartments so that he might murder you and send your head to Cao Cao. Yes, he was as wicked as that even. We saw you go away in anger, and we thought that would mean grave trouble for us, and so we have deserted.""Zhao Zilong listened with simulated joy, and he had wine served to the two men, and pressed them to drink so that they were quite overcome. When this was done, he had both bound with cords, called up their followers, and asked them whether this was real or pretended desertion, and they told him the truth.Then he gave the soldiers wine and said, ""Those who wanted to harm me are your leaders and not you. If you do as I tell you, you shall be well rewarded.""The soldiers threw themselves to the ground and promised obedience. Thereupon the two leaders —-Chen Ying and Bao Long —-were beheaded. Their five hundred troops were made to lead the way and act as screen for a whole thousand of horsemen, and the party set out at full speed for Guiyang. When they got there, they summoned the gate."
城上聽時，說陳、鮑二將軍殺了趙雲回軍，請太守商議事務。城上將火照看，果是自家軍馬。趙範急忙出城，雲喝左右捉下遂入城安撫百姓。已定，飛報玄德。玄德與孔明親赴桂陽。雲迎接入城，推趙範於階下。孔明問之，範備言以嫂許嫁之事。孔明謂雲曰：「此亦美事，公何如此？」雲曰：「趙範既與某結為兄弟，今若娶其嫂，惹人唾罵，一也；其婦再嫁，使失大節，二也；趙範初降，其心難測，三也。主公新定江漢，枕席未安，雲安敢以一婦人而廢主公之大事？」,"They said that they had slain Zhao Zilong and had got back. And they wished to speak with the Governor.Those on the wall lighted flares and inspected those at the gate. Surely enough they wore the uniforms of their own people, and Zhao Fan went out to them. He was immediately seized and made prisoner. Then Zhao Zilong entered the city, restored order, and sent off swift messengers to Liu Bei who at once, with his adviser, came to Guiyang.When they had taken their seats, the late Governor was brought in and placed at the foot of the steps. In response to Zhuge Liang's questions, Zhao Fan related the story of the proposed marriage.Said Zhuge Liang to Zhao Zilong, ""But this seems a fine project. Why did you receive the proposal so roughly?""Zhao Zilong said, ""Zhao Fan and I had just sworn brotherhood, and so marriage with his sister-in-law would have called down on my head universal blame. That is one reason. Another is that I should have made his sister fail to keep her dutiful chastity. And thirdly, I did not know whether I might trust such a proposal from one who had just yielded to force. My lord, your position as a recent victor was one of danger, and could I risk the failure of your plans for my sake?"""
玄德曰：「今日大事已定，與汝娶之，若何？」雲曰：「天下女子不少，但恐名譽不立，何患無妻子乎？」玄德曰：「子龍真丈夫也！」遂釋趙範，仍令為桂陽太守，重賞趙雲。,"Liu Bei said, ""But now that the plan has been carried out, and we are victors, would you care to marry her?""""All my fear is for the building of a reputation. Family can come later.""""You are indeed right honorable,"" said Liu Bei.Zhao Fan was released and restored to the governorship. Zhao Zilong was conspicuously rewarded."
張飛大叫曰：「偏子龍幹得功，偏我是無用之人！只撥三千軍與我去取武陵郡，活捉太守金旋來獻！」孔明大喜曰：「翼德要去不妨，但要依一件事。」正是：軍師決勝多奇策，將士爭先立戰功。未知孔明說出那一件事來，且看下文分解。,"But Zhang Fei was angry and disappointed.""So Zhao Zilong gets all the praise, and I am worth nothing,"" cried he. ""Just give me three thousand soldiers, and I will take Wuling and bring you the Governor.""This pleased Zhuge Liang, who said, ""There is no reason why you should not go, but I will only require one condition of you.""Wondrous, the plans of the general, so doth he conquer in battle;Soldiers keenly competing gain renown in the fighting. The condition that Zhuge Liang made will appear in the next chapter."
