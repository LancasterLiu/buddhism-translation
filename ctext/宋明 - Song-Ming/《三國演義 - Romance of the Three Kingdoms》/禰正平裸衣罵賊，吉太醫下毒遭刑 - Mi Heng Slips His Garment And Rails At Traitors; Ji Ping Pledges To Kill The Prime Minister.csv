卻說曹操欲斬劉岱、王忠。孔融諫曰：「二人本非劉備敵手，若斬之，恐失將士之心。」操乃免其死，黜罷爵祿，欲自起兵伐玄德。孔融曰：「方今隆冬盛寒，未可動兵；待來春未為晚也。可先使人招安張繡、劉表，然後再圖徐州。」操然其言，先遣劉曄往說張繡。曄至襄城，先見賈詡，陳說曹公盛德。詡乃留曄於家中。,"At the close of the last chapter the two unsuccessful leaders, Liu Dai and Wang Zhong, were in danger of death.However, Kong Rong remonstrated with Cao Cao, saying, ""You knew these two were no match for Liu Bei, and if you put them to death because they failed, you will lose the hearts of your people.""Wherefore the death sentence was not executed, but they were deprived of rank and status.Cao Cao next proposed to lead an army himself to attack Liu Bei, but Kong Rong advised, ""The weather is too inclement. We must wait the return of spring. In the interval, we better use the time to arrange peace with Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao, before launching an expedition against Xuzhou.""Wherefore Liu Ye was sent to Zhang Xiu and in due time reached Xiangyang. He first had an interview with Jia Xu, Zhang Xiu's adviser, whereat he dwelt upon Cao Cao's virtues so that Jia Xu was impressed. Jia Xu kept Liu Ye as a guest and undertook to smooth his way."
次日來見張繡，說曹公遣劉曄招安之事。正議間，忽報袁紹有使至。繡命入。使者呈上書信。繡覽之，亦是招安之意。詡問來使曰：「近日興兵破曹操，勝負如何？」使曰：「隆冬寒月，權且罷兵。今以將軍與荊州劉表俱有國士之風，故來相請耳。」詡大笑曰：「汝可回見本初，道：『汝兄弟尚不能容，何能容天下國士乎！」』,"Soon after Liu Ye saw Zhang Xiu and spoke of the advantages of coming to terms with Cao Cao. While the discussion was in progress, a messenger from Yuan Shao was announced, and he was called in. He presented letters and, when they also proposed terms of peace, Jia Xu asked what their success had been lately against Cao Cao.""The war had ceased for the moment on account of the winter,"" replied the messenger. ""As you, General, and Liu Biao are both well reputed officers of the state, I have been sent to request your help.""Jia Xu laughed, ""You can return to your master and say that as he could not brook rivalry of his brother, he certainly would be sorely put to it with that of all the officers of the state."""
當面扯碎書，叱退來使。張繡曰：「方今袁強曹弱；今毀書叱使，袁紹若至，當如之何？」詡曰：「不如去從曹操。」繡曰：「吾先與操有讎，安得相容？」詡曰：「從操其便有三：夫曹公奉天子明詔，征伐天下，其宜從一也；紹強盛，我以少從之，必不以我為重，操雖弱，得我必喜，其宜從二也；曹公王霸之志，必釋私怨，以明德於四海，其宜從三也。願將軍無疑焉。」,"The letter was torn into fragments before the messenger's face, and he was angrily bidden be gone.""But his master, Yuan Shao, is stronger than Cao Cao,"" protested Zhang Xiu. ""You have torn up his letter and are dismissing his man. What shall we say about such an insult should Yuan Shao come?""""Better join hands with Cao Cao,"" said Jia Xu.""But there is still between us an unavenged enmity. We could not suffer each other.""Jia Xu said, ""There are three advantages in joining hands with Cao Cao. First, he has a command from the Emperor to restore peace. Second, as Yuan Shao is so strong, our little help to him will be despised, while we shall loom large and be well treated by Cao Cao. Third, Cao Cao is going to be Chief of the Feudal Lords, and he will ignore all private feuds in order to show his magnanimity to all the world. I hope, General, you will see these things clearly and hesitate no longer."""
繡從其言，請劉曄相見。曄盛稱操德，且曰：「丞相若記舊怨，安肯使某來結好將軍乎？」繡大喜，即同賈詡等赴許都投降。繡見操，拜於階下。操忙扶起，執其手曰：「有小過失，勿記於心。」遂封繡為揚武將軍，封賈詡為執金吾使。操即命繡作書招安劉表。賈詡進曰：「劉景升好結納名流，今必得一有文名之士往說之，方可降耳。」操問荀攸曰：「誰人可去？」攸曰：「孔文舉可當其任。」,"Zhang Xiu, now convinced, became more reasonable and recalled Liu Ye, who, at the interview, extolled the many virtues of his master.""If the Prime Minister had any thought of the old quarrel, he would hardly have sent me to make friendly engagements, would he?"" said Liu Ye at the last.So Zhang Xiu and his adviser proceeded to the capital where formal submission was made. At the interview Zhang Xiu bowed low at the steps, but Cao Cao, hastening forward, took him by the hand and raised him, saying, ""Forget that little fault of mine, I pray you, General!""Zhang Xiu received the title of General Who Possesses Prowess, and Jia Xu was appointed Counselor.Cao Cao then directed his secretaries to draft letters inviting the support of Liu Biao.Jia Xu said, ""Liu Biao loves to have to do with famous people. If some famous scholar should be sent to him, he would submit forthwith.""So Cao Cao inquired of Xun You who was the best person to go as a messenger, and he recommended Kong Rong."
操然之。攸出見孔融曰：「丞相欲得一有文名之士，以備行人之選。公可當此任否？」融曰：「吾友禰衡，字正平，其才十倍於我。此人宜在帝左右，不但可備行人而已。我當薦之天子。」於是遂上表奏帝。其文曰：,"Cao Cao agreed and sent Xun You to speak with this officer. Xun You went to Kong Rong, saying, ""A scholar of reputation is required to aid as a messenger of state. Can you undertake this task?""Kong Rong replied, ""I have a certain friend, Mi Heng, whose talents are ten times mine. He ought to be constantly at the court of the Emperor and not merely be sent as a state messenger. I will recommend him to the Emperor.""So Kong Rong wrote the following memorial:"
臣聞洪水橫流，帝思俾刈；旁求四方，以招賢俊。昔世宗繼統，將弘基業；疇咨熙載，群士響臻。陛下叡聖，纂承基緒，遭遇厄運，勞謙日昃；維嶽降神，異人並出。竊見處士平原禰衡：年二十四，字正平，淑質貞亮，英才卓犖；初涉藝文，升堂睹奧。目所一見，輒誦之口；耳所暫聞，不忘於心。性與道合，思若有神。弘羊潛計，安世默識，以衡準之，誠不足怪。忠果正直，志懷霜雪；見善若驚，嫉惡若讎。任座抗行，史魚厲節，殆無以過也。鷙鳥累百，不如一鶚。使衡立朝，必有可觀，飛辯聘詞，溢氣坌涌；解疑釋結，臨敵有餘。,"""In ancient days, when the great waters were abroad, the emperor pondered over their regulation and he sought out people of talent from all directions. In old time, when Emperor Wu of the Hans desired to enlarge his borders, crowds of scholars responded to his call.""Intelligent and holy, Your Majesty ascended the throne. You have fallen upon evil days, but have been diligent, modest, and untiring in your efforts. Now the great mountains have sent forth spirits, and people of genius appear.""I, your humble servant, know of a certain simple scholar, Mi Heng by name, of Pingyuan, a young man of twenty-four. His moral character is excellent, his talents eminent. As a youth he took a high place in study and penetrated the most secret arcane of learning. What he glanced at he could repeat, what he heard once he never forgot. He is naturally high principled, and his thoughts are divine. Sang Hongyang's mental calculations and Zhang Anshi's memorial feats compared with Mi Heng's powers are no longer wonderful. Loyal, sincere, correct, and straight-forward, his ambition is unsullied. He regards the good with trembling respect; he detests the evil with uncompromising hatred. Ren Zuo in unflinching candor, Shi Yu in severe rectitude, never surpassed him.""Hundreds of hawks are not worth one osprey. If Mi Heng be given a court appointment, notable results must follow. Ready in debate, rapid in utterance, his overwhelming intelligence wells up in profusion. In the solution of doubts and the unraveling of difficulties he has no peer."
昔賈誼求試屬國，詭係單于；終軍欲以長纓，牽制勁越；弱冠慷慨，前世美之；近日路粹，嚴象亦用異才擢拜臺郎：衡宜與為比。如龍躍天衢，振翼雲漢，揚聲紫微，垂光虹蜺，足以昭近署之多士，增四門之穆穆。鈞天廣樂，必奇麗之觀；帝室王居，必蓄非常之寶。若衡等輩，不可多得。激楚、陽阿，至妙之容，掌伎者之所貪；飛兔、騕裏，絕足奔放，良、樂之所急也。臣等區區，敢不以聞？陞下篤慎取士，必須效試。乞令衡以褐衣召見。如無可觀釆，臣等受面欺之罪。」,"""In former days of Han, Jia Yi begged to be sent on trial to a vassal state for the control of the Xiongnu tribespeople; Zhong Jun offered to bring back the Prince of Nanyue to do homage to the emperor. The generous conduct of these youths has been much admired.""In our day Lu Cui and Yan Xiang, remarkable for their talents, have been appointed among the secretaries. And Mi Heng is no less capable. Should he be got, then all possibilities may be realized: The dragon may curvet through the celestial streets and soar along the Milky Way; fame will extend to the poles of the universe and hang in the firmament with rainbow glory. He would be the glory of all the present Ministers and enhance the majesty of the Palace itself. The Music will acquire new beauties, and the Palace will contain an excellent treasure. People like Mi Heng are but few. As in the recitation of 'Ji Chu Songs' and the singing of 'Yang E Poems', the most skillful performers are sought; and such fleet horses as 'Fei Tu Broncos' and 'Yao Niao Mustangs' were looked for by the famous judges of horses, Wang Liang and Bo Le.""So I, the humble one, dare not conceal this man. Your Majesty is careful in the selection of servants and should try him. Let him be summoned as he is, simply clad in his serge dress; and should he not appear worthy, then may I be punished for the fault of deception."""
帝覽表，以付曹操。操遂使人召衡至。禮畢，操不命坐。禰衡仰天歎曰：「天地雖闊，何無一人也！」操曰：「吾手下有數十人，皆當世英雄，何謂無人？」衡曰：「願聞。」操曰：「荀彧，荀攸，郭嘉，程昱，機深智遠，雖蕭何，陳平不及也。張遼，許褚，樂進，李典，勇不可當，雖岑彭，馬武不及也。呂虔，滿寵，為從事；于禁，徐晃，為先鋒。夏侯惇，天下奇才；曹子孝，世間福將。安得無人？」衡笑曰：「公言差矣。此等人物，吾盡識之：荀彧可使弔喪問疾，荀攸可使看墳守墓，程昱可使關門閉戶，郭嘉可使白詞念賦，張遼可使擊鼓鳴金，許褚可使牧牛放馬，樂進可使取狀讀詔，李典可使傳書送檄，呂虔可使磨刀鑄劍，滿寵可使飲酒食糟，于禁可使負版築牆，徐晃可使屠豬殺狗。夏侯惇稱為『完體將軍』，曹子孝呼為『要錢太守』。其餘皆是衣架！飯囊！酒桶！肉袋耳！」操怒曰：「汝有何能？」衡曰：「天文地理，無一不通；三教九流，無一不曉；上可以致君為堯、舜，下可以配德於孔、顏。豈與俗子共論乎！」時止有張遼在側，掣劍欲斬之。操曰：「吾正少一鼓吏；早晚朝賀宴享，可令禰衡充此職。」衡不推辭，應聲而去。遼曰：「此人出言不遜，何不殺之？」操曰：「此人素有虛名，遠近所聞。今日殺之，天下必謂我不能容物，彼自以為能，故令為鼓吏以辱之。」,"The Emperor read the memorial and passed it to his Prime Minister, who duly summoned Mi Heng. He came, but after his formal salutations were over, he was left standing and not invited to sit down.Looking up to heaven, Mi Heng sighed deeply, saying, ""Wide as is the universe, it cannot produce the person.""""Under my orders are scores of people whom the world call heroes. What do you mean by saying there is not the person,"" said Cao Cao.""I should be glad to hear who they are,"" said Mi Heng.""Xun Yu, Xun You, Guo Jia, and Cheng Yu are all people of profound skill and long views, superior to Xiao He and Chen Ping. Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, Li Dian, and Yue Jing are bravest of the brave, better than Cen Peng and Ma Wu. Lu Qian and Man Chong are my secretaries; Yu Jin and Xu Huang are my van leaders; Xiahou Dun is one of the world's marvels, Cao Ren is the most successful leader of the age. Now say you there are not the people?""""Sir, you are quite mistaken,"" said Mi Heng with a smile. ""I know all these things you call people. Xun Yu is qualified to pose at a funeral or ask after a sick man; Xun You is fit to be a tomb guardian; Cheng Yu might be sent to shut doors and bolt windows; and Guo Jia is a reciter of poems; Zhang Liao might beat drums and clang gongs; Xu Chu might lead cattle to pasture; Yue Jing would make a fair reader of elegy; Li Dian could carry dispatches and notices; Lu Qian would be a fair armorer; Man Chong could be sent to drink wine and eat brewers' grains; Yu Jin might be of use to carry planks and build walls; Xu Huang might be employed to kill pigs and slay dogs; Xiahou Dun should be styled 'Whole Body General,' and Cao Ren should be called 'Money-grubbing Governor.' As for the remainder, they are mere clothes shelves, rice sacks, wine vases, flesh bags.""""And what special gifts have you?"" said Cao Cao angrily.""I know everything in heaven above and the earth beneath. I am conversant with the Three Religions and the Nine Systems of Philosophy. I could make my prince the rival of Kings Yao and Shun, and I myself could compare in virtue with Confucius and Mencius. Can I discuss on even terms with common people?""Now Zhang Liao was present, and he raised his sword to strike down the impudent visitor who spoke thus to his master, but Cao Cao said, ""I want another drummer boy to play on occasions of congratulation in the court. I will confer this office upon him.""Instead of indignantly declining this, Mi Heng accepted the position and went out.""He spoke very impertinently,"" said Zhang Liao. ""Why did you not put him to death?""""He has something of a reputation; empty, but people have heard of him and so, if I put him to death, they would say I was intolerant. As he thinks he has ability, I have made him a drummer to mortify him."""
來日，操於省廳上大宴賓客，今鼓使撾鼓。舊吏云：「撾鼓必換新衣。」衡穿舊衣而入，遂擊鼓為「漁陽三撾」，音節殊妙，淵淵有金石聲。坐客聽之，莫不慷慨流涕。左右喝曰：「何不更衣！」衡當面脫下舊破衣服，裸體而立，渾身盡露。坐客皆掩面。衡乃徐徐著褲，顏色不變。,"Soon after Cao Cao instituted a banquet in the capital at which the guests were many. The drums were to be played, and the old drummers were ordered to wear new clothes. But the new drummer Mi Heng took his place with the other musicians clad in old and worn garments. The piece chosen was the ""Tolling of Yuyang,"" and from the earliest taps on the drum the effect was exquisite, profound as the notes from metal and stone. The performance stirred deeply the emotions of every guest; some even shed tears.Seeing all eyes turned on the shabby performer, the attendants said, ""Why did you not put on your new uniform?""Mi Heng turned to them, slipped off his frayed and torn robe and stood there in full view, naked as he was born. The assembled guests covered their faces. Then the drummer composedly drew on his nether garments."
操叱曰：「廟堂之上，何太無禮？」衡曰：「欺君罔上乃謂無禮。吾露父母之形，以顯清白之體耳！」操曰：「汝為清白，誰為汙濁？」衡曰：「汝不識賢愚，是眼濁也；不讀詩書，是口濁也；不納忠言，是耳濁也；不通古今，是身濁也；不容諸侯，是腹濁也；常懷篡逆，是心濁也！吾乃天下名士，用為鼓吏，是猶陽貨輕仲尼、臧倉毀孟子耳！欲成霸王之業，而如此輕人耶？」,"""Why do you behave so rudely at court?"" said Cao Cao.""To flout one's prince and insult one's superiors is the real rudeness,"" cried Mi Heng. ""I bare my natural body as an emblem of my purity.""""So you are pure! And who is foul?""""You do not distinguish between the wise and the foolish, which is to have foul vision. You have never read the Odes or the Histories, which is to have foul speech. You are deaf to honest words, which is to have foul ears. You are unable to reconcile antiquity with today, which is to be foul without. You cannot tolerate the vassals, which is to be foul within. You harbor thoughts of rebellion, which is to have a foul heart. I am one of the most famous scholars in the empire, and you make me a drummer boy, that is as Yang Huo belittling Confucius or Zang Cang vilifying Mencius. You desire to be chief and arbitrator of the great nobles, yet you treat me thus!"""
時孔融在坐，恐操殺衡，乃從容進曰：「禰衡罪同胥靡，不足發明王之夢。」操指衡而言曰：「令汝往荊州為使。如劉表來降，便用汝作公卿。」衡不肯往。操備馬三匹，令二人扶挾而行；卻教手下文武，整酒於東門外送之。荀彧曰：「如禰衡來，不可起身。」衡至。下馬入見，眾皆端坐。衡放聲大哭。荀彧問曰：「何為而哭？」衡曰：「行於死柩之中，如何不哭？」眾皆曰：「吾等是死屍，汝乃無頭狂鬼耳！」衡曰：「吾乃漢朝之臣，不作曹瞞之黨，安得無頭？」眾欲殺之。苟彧急止之曰：「量鼠雀之輩，何足汙刀！」衡曰：「吾乃鼠雀，尚有人性；汝等只可謂之蜾蟲！」眾恨而散。,"Now Kong Rong who had recommended Mi Heng for employment was among the guests, and he feared for the life of his friend. Wherefore he tried to calm the storm.""Mi Heng is only guilty of a misdemeanor,"" said Kong Rong. ""He is not a man likely to disturb your dreams like Fu Yue, Illustrious Sir.""Pointing to Mi Heng, the Prime Minister said, ""I will send you to Jingzhou as my messenger; and if Liu Biao surrenders to me, I will give you a post at court.""But Mi Heng was unwilling to go. So Cao Cao bade two of his men prepare three horses, and they set Mi Heng on the middle one and dragged him along the road between them.It is also related that a great number of officers of all ranks assembled at the East Gate to see the messenger start.Xun Yu said, ""When Mi Heng comes, we will not rise to salute him.""So when Mi Heng came, dismounted, and entered the waiting room, they all sat stiff and silent. Mi Heng uttered a loud cry.""What is that for?"" said Xun Yu.""Should not one cry out when one enters a coffin?"" said Mi Heng.""We may be corpses,"" shouted they altogether, ""but you are a wandering headless ghost.""""I am a minister of Han and not a partisan of Cao Cao's,"" cried Mi Heng. ""You cannot say I have no head.""They were angry enough to kill him, but Xun Yu checked them, saying, ""He is a paltry fellow. It is not worth soiling your blades with his blood.""""I am paltry, and yet I have the soul of a man, and you are mere worms,"" said Mi Heng. They went their ways, all very angry."
衡至荊州，見劉表畢，雖頌德，實譏諷。表不喜，令去江夏見黃祖。或問表曰：「禰衡戲謔主公，何不殺之？」表曰：「禰衡數辱曹操，操不殺者，恐失人望；故令作使於我，欲借我手殺之，使我受害賢之名也。吾今遣去見黃祖，使曹操知我有識。」眾皆稱善。,"Mi Heng went on his journey and presently reached Jingzhou, where he saw Liu Biao. After that, under pretense of extolling Liu Biao's virtue, he lampooned Liu Biao who was annoyed and sent him to Jiangxia to see Huang Zu.""Why did you not put the fellow to death for lampooning you?"" said one to Liu Biao.""You see he shamed Cao Cao, but Cao Cao did not kill him as Cao Cao feared to lose popular favor. So Cao Cao sent him to me, thinking to borrow my hand to slay him and so suffer the loss of my good name. I have sent him on to Huang Zu to let Cao Cao see that I understood."" Liu Biao's clever caution met with general praise."
時袁紹亦遣使至。表問眾謀士曰：「袁本初又遣使來，曹孟德又差禰衡在此，當從何便？」從事中郎將韓嵩進曰：「今兩雄相持，將軍若欲有為，乘此破敵可也。如其不然，將擇其善者而從之。今曹操善能用兵，賢俊多歸，其勢必先取袁紹，然後移兵向江東，恐將軍不能禦；莫若舉荊州以附操，操必重待將軍矣。」表曰：「汝且去許都，觀其動靜，再作商議。」嵩曰：「君臣各有定分。嵩今事將軍，雖赴湯蹈火，一唯所命。將軍若能上順天子，下從曹公，使嵩可也；如持疑未定，嵩到京師，天子賜嵩一官，則嵩為天子之臣，不得復為將軍死矣。」表曰：「汝且先往觀之。吾別有主意。」,"At that time a messenger from Yuan Shao was also there with certain proposals for an alliance, and it was necessary to decide which aide to espouse. All the advisers came together to consider the question.Then Commander Han Song said, ""As you have now two offers, you can please yourself and choose your own way to destroy your enemies; for if one refuses, you can follow the other. Now Cao Cao is an able general and has many capable officers in his train. It looks as though he may destroy Yuan Shao and then move his armies across the river. I fear, my lord, you would be unable then to withstand him. That being so, it would be wise to support Cao Cao, who will treat you with respect.""Liu Biao replied, ""You go to the capital and see how things tend. That will help me to decide.""Han Song said, ""The positions of master and servant are clearly defined. Now I am your man prepared to go all lengths for you and obey you to the last, whether in serving the Emperor or in following Cao Cao. But lest there should be any doubt you must remember that if the Emperor gives me any office, then I shall become his servant and shall not be ready to face death for you.""""You go and find out what you can. I have ideas in my mind."""
嵩辭表，到許都見操。操遂拜嵩為侍中，領零陵太守。荀彧曰：「韓嵩來觀動靜，未有微功，重加此職。禰衡又無音耗，丞相遣而不問，何也？」操曰：「禰衡辱吾太甚，故借劉表手殺之，何必再問？」遂遣韓嵩回荊州說劉表。嵩回見表，稱頌朝廷盛德，勸表遣子入侍。表大怒曰：「汝懷二心耶！」欲斬之。嵩大叫曰：「將軍負嵩，嵩不負將軍！」蒯良曰：「嵩未去之前，先有此言矣。」劉表遂赦之。,"So Han Song took his leave and went to the capital, where he saw Cao Cao. Cao Cao gave him rank and made him Governor of Lingling.Adviser Xun Yu remonstrated, saying, ""This man came to spy out how things were moving. He has done nothing to deserve reward, and yet you give him an office like this. There were no such suspicious rumors connected with poor Mi Heng, and yet you sent him off and would never test his power.""""Mi Heng shamed me too deeply before all the world. I am going to borrow Liu Biao's hand to remove him. And you need say no more,"" said Cao Cao.Then Cao Cao sent Han Song back to his former master to tell him what had happened. Han Song came and was full of praise for the virtues of the court and was keen on persuading Liu Biao to espouse that side.Then Liu Biao suddenly turned angry, charged him with treachery, put him in prison, and threatened him with death.""You turn your back on me,"" cried Han Song. ""I did not betray you.""Kuai Liang remarked, ""Han Song had foretold this possibility before he left. It is only what he expected.""Liu Biao, who was just and reasonable, went no further."
人報黃祖斬了禰衡，表問其故。對曰：「黃祖與禰衡共飲，皆醉。祖問衡曰：『君在許都有何人物？』衡曰：『大兒孔文舉，小兒楊德祖：除此二人，別無人物。』祖曰：『似我何如？』衡曰：『汝似廟中之神，雖受祭祀，恨無靈驗！』祖大怒曰：『汝以我為土木偶人耶！』遂斬之。衡至死罵不絕口。」劉表聞衡死，亦嗟呀不已，令葬於鸚鵡洲邊。後人有詩歎曰：,"Presently came the news that Mi Heng had been put to death by Huang Zu on account of a quarrel begun over the wine cups. Both being worse for liquor they had begun to discuss the worth of people.""You were in Xuchang,"" said Huang Zu. ""Who was there of worth?""""The big boy was Kong Rong and the little one Yang Xiu. There was no one else to count.""""What am I like?"" said Huang Zu.""You are like a god in a temple: You sit still and receive sacrifice, but the lack of intelligence is pitiful.""""Do you regard me as a mere image?"" cried Huang Zu, angrily.So Huang Zu put the impudent speaker to death. Even at the very point of death, Mi Heng never ceased his railing and abuse.""Alas!"" sighed Liu Biao when he heard Mi Heng's fate. Then Liu Biao had the victim honorably interred near Yingwu, on Parrot Island.And a later poet wrote of Mi Heng:"
黃祖才非長者儔，禰衡喪首此江頭。今來鸚鵡洲邊過，惟有無情碧水流。,"Huang Zu could brook no rival; at his wordMi Heng met death, beneath the cruel sword.His grave on Parrot Isle may yet be seen,The river flowing past it, coldly green."
卻說曹操知禰衡受害，笑曰：「腐儒舌劍，反自殺矣！」因不見劉表來降，便欲興兵問罪。荀彧諫曰：「袁紹未平，劉備未滅，而欲用兵江漢，是猶舍心腹而顧手足也。可先滅袁紹，後滅劉備，江漢可一掃而平矣。」操從之。,"Cao Cao heard of the young man's death with pleasure.""The putrid bookworm has just cut himself up with his own sharp tongue,"" said he.As there was no sign of Liu Biao coming to join him, Cao Cao began to think of coercion. Xun Yu dissuaded him from this course.Said he, ""Yuan Shao is not subjugated; Liu Bei is not destroyed. To attack Liu Biao would be to neglect the vital to care for the immaterial. Destroy the two chief enemies first, and the Han River is yours at one blow.""And Cao Cao took the advice."
且說董承自劉玄德去後，日夜與王子服等商議，無計可施。建安五年，元旦朝賀，見曹操驕橫愈甚，感憤成疾。帝知國舅染病，令隨朝太醫前去醫治。此醫乃洛陽人：姓吉，名太，字稱平，人皆呼為吉平，當時名醫也。平到董承府用藥調治，旦夕不離；常見董承長吁短歎，不敢動問。,"After the departure of Liu Bei, Dong Cheng and his fellow conspirators did nothing else day or night but try to evolve plans for the destruction of Cao Cao. But they could see no chance to attack. At the new year audience Cao Cao was odiously arrogant and overweening, and the chief conspirator's disgust was so intense that he fell ill.Hearing of the State Uncle's indisposition, the Emperor sent the Court Physician to see him. The Court Physician at this time was a native of Luoyang, named Ji Ping. A very famous physician, Ji Ping devoted himself wholly to the treatment of his court patient. Living in Dong Cheng's palace and seeing Dong Cheng at all times, Ji Ping soon found that some secret grief was sorely troubling him. But Ji Ping dared not ask questions."
時值元宵，吉平辭去，承留住，二人共飲。飲至更餘，承覺困倦，就和衣而睡。忽報王子服等四人至，承出接入。服曰：「大事諧矣！」承曰：「願聞其說。」服曰：「劉表結連袁紹，起兵五十萬，共分十路殺來。馬騰結連韓遂，起西涼軍七十二萬，從北殺來。曹操盡起許昌兵馬，分頭迎敵，城中空虛。若聚五家僮僕，可得千餘人。乘今夜府中大宴，慶賞元宵，將府圍住，突入殺之。不可失此機會！」,"One evening of the full moon festival, when the physician was just taking his leave, Dong Cheng kept him, and the two men had supper together. They eat talking for some time, and Dong Cheng by and by dropped off to sleep dressed as he was.Presently Wang Zifu and the others were announced. As they were coming in, Wang Zifu cried, ""Our business is settled!""""I should be glad to hear how,"" said Dong Cheng.""Liu Biao has joined Yuan Shao, and five hundred thousand troops in fifty legions are on their way here by different routes. More than this, Ma Teng and Han Sui are coming from the northwest with seven hundred thousand Xiliang troops. Cao Cao has moved every soldier outside Xuchang to meet the combined armies. There is a great banquet in his palace tonight. If we get together our young men and servants, we can muster more than a thousand, and we can surround the palace, while Cao Cao is at the banquet, and finish him off. We must not miss this."""
承大喜，隨即喚家奴各人收拾兵器，自己披挂綽鎗上馬，約會都在內門前相會，同時進兵。夜至二鼓，眾兵皆到。董承手提寶劍，徒步直入，見操設宴後堂，大叫：「操賊休走！」一劍剁去，隨手而倒。霎時覺來，乃南柯一夢，口中猶罵操賊不止。吉平向前叫曰：「汝欲害曹公乎？」承驚懼不能答。吉平曰：「國舅休慌。某雖醫人，未嘗忘漢。某連日見國舅嗟歎，不敢動問。恰纔夢中之言，已見真情。幸勿相瞞。倘有用某之處，雖滅九族，亦無後悔。」承掩面而哭曰：「只恐汝非真心！」,"Dong Cheng was more than delighted. He called his servants and armed them, put on his own armor and mounted his horse. The conspirators met, as they had arranged, just at the inner gate of the Prime Minister's palace. It was the first watch. The small army marched straight in, Dong Cheng leading with his treasured sword drawn. His intended victim was at table in one of the private rooms. Dong Cheng rushed in, crying, ""Cao Cao, you rebel, stay!"" and dashed at Cao Cao who fell at the first blow.And just then he woke up and found it was all a dream, but his mouth was still full of curses.""Do you really wish to destroy Cao Cao?"" said Ji Ping, going forward to his half awakened patient.This brought Dong Cheng to his senses. He stopped, terror stricken, and made no reply.""Do not be frightened, O Uncle,"" said the doctor. ""Although I am a physician, I am also a man, and I never forget my emperor. You have seemed sad for many days, but I have never ventured to ask the reason. Now you have shown it in your dream, and I know your real feelings. If I can be of any use, I will help. Nothing can daunt me.""Dong Cheng covered his face and wept.""I fear you may not be true to me,"" cried he."
平遂咬下一指為誓。承乃取出衣帶詔，令平視之；且曰：「今之謀望不成者，乃劉玄德、馬騰各自去了，無計可施，因此感而成疾。」平曰：「不消諸公用心。操賊性命，只在某手中。」承問其故。平曰：「操常患頭風，痛入骨髓；纔一舉發，便召某醫治。如早晚有召，只用一服毒藥，必然死矣，何必舉刀兵乎？」承曰：「若得如此，救漢朝社稷者，皆賴君也！」,"Ji Ping at once bit off a finger as a pledge of his faith. And then his host and patient brought forth the decree he had received in the girdle.""I am afraid our schemes will come to nought,"" said Dong Cheng. ""Liu Bei and Ma Teng are gone, and there is nothing we can do. That was the real reason I fell ill.""""It is not worth troubling you gentlemen with, for Cao Cao's life lies in these hands of mine,"" said Ji Ping.""How can that be?""""Because he is often ill with deep-seated pain in his head. When this comes on, he sends for me. When next he calls me, I only have to give him one dose and he will certainly die. We do not want any weapons.""""If only you could do it! You would be the savior of the dynasty. It depends upon you."""
時吉平辭歸。承心中暗喜，步入後堂，忽見家奴秦慶童同侍妾雲英在暗處私語。承大怒，喚左右捉下，欲殺之。夫人勸免其死，各人仗四十，將慶童鎖於冷房。慶童懷恨，夤夜將鐵鎖扭斷，跳墻而出，逕入曹操府中，告有機密事。操喚入密室問之。慶童云：「王子服，吳子蘭，种輯，吳碩，馬騰五人在家主府中商議機密，必然是謀丞相。家主將出白絹一段，不知寫著甚的。近日吉平咬指為誓，我也曾見。」,"Then Ji Ping went away leaving his late patient a happy man. Dong Cheng strolled into the garden and there he saw one of his servants, Qin Qington, whispering with one of the concubines, Yun Ying, in a dark corner. This annoyed him, and he called his attendants to seize them. He would have put them to death but for the intervention of his wife. At her request he spared their lives, but both were beaten forty canes, and the lad was thrown into a dungeon. Sulky at this treatment, Qin Qington broke out of the cell in the night, climbed over the wall, and went straight to Cao Cao's palace, where he betrayed the conspiracy.Cao Cao at once had him taken into a secret chamber and questioned him.Qin Qington gave the names of the conspirators, saying, ""Wang Zifu, Wu Zilan, Chong Ji, Wu Shi, Ma Teng, and my master have been meeting secretly. My master has a roll of white silk, with writing on it, but I do not know what it means. Yesterday, Ji Ping bit off one of his fingers as a pledge of fidelity. I saw that."""
曹操藏匿慶童於府中，董承只道逃往他方向去了，也不追尋。次日，曹操詐患頭風，召吉平用藥。平自思曰：「此賊合休！」暗藏毒藥入府。操臥於床上，令平下藥。平曰：「此病可一服即愈。」教取藥罐，當面煎之。藥已半乾，平已暗下毒藥，親自送上。操知有毒，故意遲延不服。平曰：「乘熱服之，少汗即愈。」操起曰：「汝既讀儒書，必知禮義。『君有疾飲藥，臣先嘗之；父有疾飲藥，子先嘗之。』汝為我心腹之人，何不先嘗而後進？」平曰：「藥以治病，何用人嘗？」,"Qin Qington was kept in a secret part of the palace, while his late master, Dong Cheng, only knowing that he had run away, took no special means to find him.Soon after this Cao Cao feigned a headache and sent for Ji Ping as usual.""The rebel is done for,"" thought Ji Ping, and he made a secret package of poison which he took with him to the palace of the Prime Minister. He found Cao Cao in bed. The patient bade the doctor prepare a potion for him.""One draught will cure this disease,"" said Ji Ping.He bade them bring him a pot, and he prepared the potion in the room. When it had simmered for some time and was half finished, the poison was added, and soon after the physician presented the draught. Cao Cao, knowing it was poisoned, made excuses and would not swallow it.""You should take it hot,"" said the doctor. ""Then there will be a gentle perspiration, and you will be better.""""You are a scholar,"" said Cao Cao, sitting up, ""and know what is the correct thing to do. When the master is ill and takes drugs, the attendant first tastes them; when a man is ill, his son first tastes the medicine. You are my confidant and should drink first. Then I will swallow the remainder.""""Medicine is to treat disease. What is the use of anyone's tasting it?"" said Ji Ping."
平知事已泄，縱步向前，扯住操耳而灌之。操推藥潑地，磚皆迸裂。操未及言，左右已將吉平執下。操曰：「吾豈有疾，特試汝耳！汝果有害我之心！」遂喚二十個精壯獄卒，執平至後園拷問。操坐於亭上，將吉平縛倒於地。吉平面不改容，略無懼怯。操笑曰：「量汝是個醫人，安敢下毒害我？必有人唆使你來。你說出那人，我便饒你。」平叱之曰：「汝乃欺君罔上之賊，天下皆欲殺汝，豈獨我乎！」操再三磨問。平怒曰：「我自欲殺汝，安有人使我來？今事不成，惟死而已！」操怒，教獄卒痛打。打到兩個時辰，皮開肉裂，血流滿階。操恐打死，無可對證，今獄卒揪去靜處，權且將息。傳令次日設宴，請眾大臣飲酒。惟董承託病不來。王子服等皆恐操生疑，只得俱至。操於後堂設席。酒行數巡，曰：「筵中無可為樂，我有一人，可為眾官醒酒。」教二十個獄卒：「與吾牽來！」,"But he guessed now the conspiracy had been discovered, so he dashed forward, seized Cao Cao by the ear, and tried to pour the potion down his throat. Cao Cao pushed it away, and it spilt. The bricks upon which it fell were split asunder. Before Cao Cao could speak, his servants had already seized the assailant.Said Cao Cao, ""I am not ill. I only wanted to test you. So you really thought to poison me!""He sent for a score of sturdy gaolers who carried off the prisoner to the inner apartments to be interrogated. Cao Cao took his seat in a pavilion, and the hapless physician, tightly bound, was thrown to the ground before him. The prisoner maintained a bold front.Cao Cao said, ""I thought you were a physician. How dared you try to poison me? Someone incited you to this crime. If you tell me, I will pardon you.""""You are a rebel. You flout your Prince and injure your betters. The whole empire wishes to kill you. Do you think I am the only one?""Cao Cao again and again pressed the prisoner to tell what he knew, but he only replied that no one had sent him and it was his own desire.""I have failed, and I can but die,"" added Ji Ping.Cao Cao angrily bade the gaolers give him a severe beating, and they dogged him for two watches. His skin hung in tatters, the flesh was battered, and the blood from his wounds ran down the steps. Then fearing he might die and his evidence be lost, Cao Cao bade them cease and remove him. They took him off to a quiet place where he might recover somewhat.Having issued orders to prepare a banquet for next day, Cao Cao invited all the courtiers thereto. Dong Cheng was the only one who excused himself, saying he was unwell. The other conspirators dared not stay away as they felt they would be suspected.Tables were laid in the private apartments, and after several courses the host said, ""There is not much to amuse us today, but I have a man to show you that will sober you.""""Bring him in!"" Cao Cao said, turning to the gaolers."
須臾，只見一長枷釘著吉平，拖至階下。操曰：「眾官不知：此人連結惡黨，欲反背朝廷，謀害曹某；今日天敗，請聽口詞。」操教先打一頓，昏絕於地，以水噴面。吉平甦醒，睜目切齒而罵曰：「操賊！不殺我，更待何時？」操曰：「同謀者先有六人，與汝共七人耶？」平只是大罵。王子服等四人面面相覷，如坐鍼氈。操教一面打，一面噴。平並無求饒之意。操見不招，且教牽去。,"The hapless Ji Ping appeared, securely fastened in a wooden collar. He was placed where all could see him.""You officials do not know that this man is connected with a gang of evil doers who desire to overturn the government and even injure me. However, Heaven has defeated their plans, but I desire that you should hear his evidence.""Then Cao Cao ordered the gaolers to beat their prisoner. They did so till Ji Ping lay unconscious, when they revived him by spraying water over his face. As soon as he came to, he glared at his oppressor and ground his teeth.""Cao Cao, you rebel! What are you waiting for? Why not kill me?"" cried Ji Ping.Cao Cao replied, ""The conspirators were only six at first; you made the seventh. Is that true?""Here the prisoner broke in with more abuse, while Wang Zifu and the other three conspirators exchanged glances, looking as though they were sitting on a rug full of needles. Cao Cao continued his torture of the prisoner, beating him into unconsciousness and reviving him with cold water, the victim disdaining to ask mercy. Finally Cao Cao realized he would incriminate none of his accomplices, and so he told the gaolers to remove Ji Ping."
眾官席散，操只留王子服等四人夜宴。四人魂不附體，只得留待。操曰：「本不相留，爭奈有事相問。汝四人不知與董承商議何事？」子服曰：「並未商議甚事。」操曰：「白絹中寫著何事？」子服等皆隱諱，操喚出慶童對証。子服曰：「汝於何處見來？」慶童曰：「你迴避了眾人，六人在一處畫字，如何賴得？」子服曰：「此賊與國舅侍妾通姦，被責誣主，不可聽也。」操曰：「吉平下毒，非董承所使而誰？」子服等皆言不知。操曰：「今晚自首，尚猶可恕；若待事發，其實難容！」,"At the close of the banquet, when the guests were dispersing, four of them, the four conspirators, were invited to remain behind to supper. They were terrified so that their souls seemed no longer to inhabit their bodies, but there was no saying nay to the invitation.Presently Cao Cao said, ""Still there is something I want to speak about, so I have asked you to stay for a time longer. I do not know what you four have been arranging with Dong Cheng.""""Nothing at all,"" said Wang Zifu.""And what is written on the white silk?"" asked Cao Cao.They all said they knew nothing about it.Then Cao Cao ordered the runaway servant to be brought in. As soon as Qin Qington came, Wang Zifu said, ""Well, what have you seen and where?""Qin Qington replied, ""You five very carefully chose retired places to talk in, and you secretly signed a white roll. You cannot deny that.""Wang Zifu replied, ""This miserable creature was punished for misbehavior with one of Uncle Dong Cheng's maids, and now because of that he slanders his master. You must not listen to him.""""Ji Ping tried to pour poison down my throat. Who told him to do that if it was not Dong Cheng?"" said Cao Cao.They all said they knew nothing about who it was.""So far,"" said Cao Cao, ""matters are only beginning, and there is a chance of forgiveness. But if the thing grows, it will be difficult not to take notice of it."""
子服等皆言並無此事。操叱左右將四人拏住監禁。次日，帶領眾人逕投董承家探病。承只得出迎。操曰：「緣何夜來不赴宴？」承曰：「微疾未痊，不敢輕出。」操曰：「此是憂國家病耳。」承愕然。操曰：「國舅知吉平事乎？」承曰：「不知。」操冷笑曰：「國舅如何不知？」喚左右：「牽來與國舅起病。」承舉措無地。,"The whole four vigorously denied that any plot existed. However Cao Cao called up his henchmen, and the four men were put into confinement.Next day Cao Cao with a large following went to the State Uncle's palace to ask after his health.Dong Cheng came out to receive his visitor, who at once said, ""Why did you not come last night?""""I am not quite well yet and have to be very careful about going out,"" replied Dong Cheng.""One might say you were suffering from national sorrow, eh?"" said Cao Cao.Dong Cheng started. Cao Cao continued, ""Have you heard of the Ji Ping affair?""""No. What is it?""Cao Cao smiled coldly, saying, ""How can it be you do not know?""He turned to his attendants and told them to bring in the prisoner, while he went on talking to his host about national illness. Dong Cheng was much put about and knew not what to do."
須臾，二十獄卒推吉平至階下。吉平大罵：「曹操逆賊！」操指謂承曰：「此人曾攀下王子服等四人，吾已拏下廷尉。尚有一人，未曾捉獲。」因問平曰：「誰使汝來藥我？可速招出！」平曰：「天使我來殺逆賊！」操怒教打。身上無容刑之處。承在座觀之，心如刀割。操又問平曰：「你原有十指，今如何只有九指？」平曰：「嚼以為誓，誓殺國賊！」操教取刀來，就階下截去其九指，曰：「一發截了，教你為誓！」平曰：「尚有口可以吞賊，有舌可以罵賊！」操令割其舌。平曰：「且勿動手。吾今刑不過，只得供招。可釋吾縛。」操曰：「釋之何礙？」遂命解其縛。平起身望闕拜曰：「臣不能為國家除賊？乃天數也！」拜畢，撞階而死。操令分其肢體號令。時建安五年正月也。史官有詩曰：,"Soon the gaolers led in the physician to the steps of the hall. At once the bound man began to rail at Cao Cao as rebel and traitor.""This man,"" said Cao Cao, pointing to Ji Ping, ""has implicated Wang Zifu and three others, all of whom are now under arrest. There is one more whom I have not caught yet.""""Who sent you to poison me?"" continued Cao Cao, turning toward the physician. ""Quick, tell me!""""Heaven sent me to slay a traitor!""Cao Cao angrily ordered them to beat Ji Ping again, but there was no part of his body that could be beaten. Dong Cheng sat looking at him, his heart feeling as if transfixed with a dagger.""You were born with ten fingers. How is it you have now only nine?""Ji Ping replied, ""I bit off one as a pledge when I swore to slay a traitor.""Cao Cao told them to bring a knife, and they lopped off his other nine fingers.""Now they are all off. That will teach you to make pledges.""""Still I have a mouth that can swallow a traitor and a tongue that can curse him,"" said Ji Ping.Cao Cao told them to cut out his tongue.Ji Ping said, ""Do not. I cannot endure any more punishment, I shall have to speak out. Loosen my bonds.""""Loose them. There is no reason why not,"" said Cao Cao.They loosed him. As soon as he was free, Ji Ping stood up, turned his face toward the Emperor's palace and bowed, saying, ""It is Heaven's will that thy servant has been unable to remove the evil.""Then he turned and smashed his head into the steps and died.His body was quartered and exposed. This happened in the first month of the fifth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 200), and a certain historian wrote a poem:"
漢朝無起色，醫國有稱平。立誓除姦黨，捐軀報聖明。極刑詞愈烈，慘死氣如生。十指淋漓處，千秋仰異名。,"There lived in Han a simple physician.No warrior, yet braveEnough to risk his very lifeHis Emperor to save.Alas! He failed; but lasting fameIs his; he feared not death;He cursed the traitorous Prime MinisterUnto his latest breath."
操見吉平已死，教左右牽過秦慶童至面前。操曰：「國舅認得此人否？」承大怒曰：「逃奴在此！即當誅之！」操曰：「他首告謀反，今來對證，誰敢誅之？」承曰：「丞相何故聽逃奴一面之說？」操曰：「王子服等吾已擒下，皆招證明白，汝尚抵賴乎？」即喚左右拏下，命從人直入董承臥房內，搜出衣帶詔并義狀。操看了，笑曰：「鼠輩安敢如此！」遂命：「將董承全家良賤，盡皆監禁，休教走脫一個。」操回府以詔狀示眾謀士商議，要廢獻帝，更立新君。正是：數行丹詔成虛望，一紙盟書惹禍殃。未知獻帝性命如何，且看下文分解。,"Seeing his victim had passed beyond the realm of punishment, Cao Cao had Qin Qington led in.""Do you know this man, Uncle?""""Yes,"" cried Dong Cheng. ""So the runaway servant is here. He ought to be put to death!""""He just told me of your treachery. He is my witness,"" said Cao Cao. ""Who would dare kill him?""""How can you, the First Minister of State, heed the unsupported tale of an absconding servant?""""But I have Wang Zifu and the others in prison,"" said Cao Cao. ""And how can you rebut their evidence?""He then called in the remainder of his followers and ordered them to search Dong Cheng's bedroom. They did so and found the decree that had been given him in the girdle and the pledge signed by the conspirators.""You mean rat!"" cried Cao Cao. ""You dared do this?""He gave orders to arrest the whole household without exception. Then he returned to his palace with the incriminating documents and called all his advisers together to discuss the dethronement of the Emperor and the setting up of a successor.Many decrees, blood written, have issued, accomplishing nothing,One inscribed pledge was fraught with mountains of sorrow.The reader who wishes to know the fate of the Emperor must read the next chapter."
