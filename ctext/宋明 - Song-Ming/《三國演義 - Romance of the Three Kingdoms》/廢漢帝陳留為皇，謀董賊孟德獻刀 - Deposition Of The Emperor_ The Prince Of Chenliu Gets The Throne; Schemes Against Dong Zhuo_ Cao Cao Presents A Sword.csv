且說董卓欲殺袁紹，李儒止之曰：「事未可定，不可妄殺。」袁紹手提寶劍，辭別百官而出，懸節東門，奔翼州去了。卓謂太傳袁隗曰：「汝姪無禮，吾看汝面，姑恕之。廢立之事若何？」隗曰：「太尉所見是也。」卓曰：「敢有阻大議者，以軍法從事。」群臣震恐，皆云：「一聽尊命。」宴罷，卓問侍中周毖、校尉伍瓊曰：「袁紹此去若何？」周毖曰：「袁紹忿忿而去，若購之急，勢必為變，且袁氏樹恩四世，門生故吏，遍於天下；倘收豪傑以聚徙眾，英雄因之而起，山東非公有也。不如赦之，拜為一郡守，則紹喜於免罪，必無患矣。」伍瓊曰：「袁紹好謀無斷，不足為慮；誠不若加之一郡守，以收民心。」,"Dong Zhuo was on the point of slaying Yuan Shao, but Li Ru checked him, saying, ""You must not kill rashly while the business hangs in the balance.""Yuan Shao, his sword still unsheathed, left the assembly. He hung up the seals of his office at the east gate and went to Jizhou Region. Dong Zhuo said to Imperial Guardian Yuan Wei, ""Your nephew behaved improperly, but I pardon him for your sake. What think you of my scheme?""""What you think is right,"" was the reply.""If anyone opposes the great scheme, he will be dealt with by military law!"" said Dong Zhuo.The ministers, thoroughly dreaded, promised obedience, and the feast came to an end. Dong Zhuo asked Counselor Zhou Bi and Commander Wu Qiong what they thought of the flight of Yuan Shao.Zhou Bi said, ""He left in a state of great anger. In such a state of excitement much harm may ensue to the present state of affairs, especially as the Yuan family have been noted for their high offices for four generations, and their proteges and dependents are everywhere. If they assemble bold people and call up their clients, all the valiant warriors will be in arms, and the whole Shandong Mountains will be lost. You had better pardon Yuan Shao and give him a post. He will be glad at being forgiven and will do no harm.""Wu Qiong said, ""Yuan Shao is fond of scheming, but he fails in decision and so is not to be feared. But it would be well to give him rank and thus win popular favor."""
卓從之，即日差人拜紹為渤海太守。九月朔，請帝陞嘉德殿，大會文武。卓拔劍在手，對眾曰：「天子闇弱，不足以君天下。今有策文一道，宜為宣讀。」乃令李儒讀策曰：「孝靈皇帝，早棄臣民；皇帝，海內仰望。而帝天資輕佻，威儀不恪，居喪慢惰：否德既彰，有忝大位。皇太后教無母儀，統政荒亂。永樂太后暴崩，眾論惑焉。三綱之道，天地之紀，毋乃有闕？陳留王協，聖德偉懋，規矩肅然；居喪哀戚，言不以邪；休聲美譽，天下所聞：宜承洪業，為萬世統。茲廢皇帝為弘農王，皇太后還政。請奉陳留王為皇帝，應天順人，以慰生靈之望。」,"Dong Zhuo followed this advice, and within that day sent a messenger to offer Yuan Shao the governorship of Bohai. On the first day of the ninth month, the Emperor was invited to proceed to the Hall of Virtue where was a great assembly of officials. There Dong Zhuo, sword in hand, faced the gathering and said, ""The Emperor is a weakling unequal to the burden of ruling this land. Now listen ye to the document I have prepared!""And Li Ru read as follows: ""The dutiful Emperor Ling too soon left his people. The emperor is the cynosure of all the people of this land. Upon the present Emperor Bian, Heaven has conferred but small gifts: In dignity and deportment he is deficient, and in mourning he is remiss. Only the most complete virtue can grace imperial dignity. Empress He has trained him improperly, and the whole state administration has fallen into confusion. Empress Dong died suddenly and no one knew why. The doctrine of the three bonds —-Heaven, Earth, and Human —-and the continuity of Heaven and Earth interdependence have both been injured.""But Liu Xian, Prince of Chenliu, is sage and virtuous beside being of handsome exterior. He conforms to all the rules of propriety: His mourning is sincere, and his speech is always correct. Eulogies of him fill the empire. He is well fitted for the great duty of consolidating the rule of Han.""Now therefore the Emperor is deposed and created Prince of Hongnong, and Empress He retires from the administration.""I pray the Prince of Chenliu to accept the throne in conformity with the decrees of Heaven and Earth, the desires of people, and the fulfillment of the hopes of humankind."""
李儒讀策畢，卓叱左右扶帝下殿，解其璽綬，北面長跪，稱臣聽命。又呼太后去服候敕。帝后皆號哭。群臣無不悲慘。階下一大臣，憤怒高叫曰：「賊臣董卓，敢為欺天之謀，吾當以頸血濺之！」揮手中象簡，直擊董卓。卓大怒，喝武士拏下，乃尚書丁管也。卓命牽出斬也。管罵不絕口，至死神色不變。後人有詩歎曰：,"This having been read, Dong Zhuo bade the officials lead the Emperor down from the throne, remove his seal, and cause him to kneel facing the north, styling himself faithful servant of the Throne and requesting commands. Moreover Dong Zhuo bade Empress He strip off her royal dress of ceremony and await the imperial command. Both victims of this oppression wept bitterly, and every minister present was deeply affected. One minister put his discontent into words, crying, ""The false Dong Zhuo is the author of this insult, which I will risk my life to wipe away!"" And with this he rushed at Dong Zhuo threatening with his ivory baton of office. It was Chair of the Secretariat Ding Guan. Dong Zhuo had Ding Guan removed and summarily put to death. Before his death, Ding Guan ceased not to rail at the oppressor, nor was he frightened at death."
董賊潛懷廢立圖，漢家宗社委丘墟。滿朝臣宰皆囊括，惟有丁公是丈夫。,"The rebel Dong Zhuo conceived the foul designTo thrust the King aside and wrong his line.With folded arms the courtiers stood, save oneDing Guan, who dared to cry that wrong was done."
卓請陳留王登殿。群臣朝賀畢，卓命扶何太后并弘農王及帝妃唐氏於永安宮閒住，封鎖宮門，禁群臣無得擅入。可憐少帝四月登基，至九月即被廢。卓所立陳留王協，表字伯和，靈帝中子，即獻帝也，時年九歲。改元初平。董卓為相國，贊拜不名，入朝不趨，劍履上殿，威福莫比。李儒勸卓擢用名流，以收人望，因薦蔡邕之才。卓命徵之，邕不赴。卓怒，使人謂邕曰：「如不來，當滅汝族。」邕懼，只得應命而至。卓見邕大喜，一月三遷其官，拜為侍中，甚見親厚。,"Then the emperor designate, Prince of Chenliu, went to the upper part of the hall to receive congratulations. After this the former Emperor —-now Prince of Hongnong —-, his mother, and the Imperial Consort, Lady Tang, were removed to the Palace of Forever Calm. The entrance gates were locked against all comers.It was pitiful! There was the young emperor, after reigning less than half a year, deposed and another put in his place. The new Emperor was Liu Xian, the second son of the late Emperor Ling. He was nine years of age, five years younger than his deposed brother. The new reign-style was changed to Inauguration of Tranquillity, the first year (AD 190).Becoming the Prime Minister, Dong Zhuo was most powerful and arrogant. When he bowed before the throne, he did not declare his name. In going to court he did not hasten. Booted and armed he entered the reception halls. He amassed a wealth exceeding any other's.His adviser, Li Ru, impressed upon Dong Zhuo constantly to employ people of reputation so that he should gain public esteem. Therefore, Dong Zhuo restored many offices of those who had been victims of the eunuchs. For those who had died, he gave ranks and positions to their progeny. When they told him Cai Yong was a man of talent, Dong Zhuo summoned him. But Cai Yong would not go. Dong Zhuo sent a message to him that if he did not come, he and his whole clan should be exterminated. Then Cai Yong gave in and appeared. Dong Zhuo was very gracious to him and promoted him thrice in a month. Cai Yong became Court Counselor. Such was the generosity of the Prime Minister."
卻說少帝與何太后、唐妃困於永安宮中，衣服飲食，漸漸欠缺；少帝淚不曾乾。一日，偶見雙燕飛於庭中，遂吟詩一首。詩曰：,"Meanwhile the deposed ruler, his mother, and his consort were immured in the Palace of Forever Calm and found their daily supplies gradually diminishing. The deposed Emperor wept incessantly. One day a pair of swallows gliding to and fro moved him to verse:"
嫩草綠凝煙，裊裊雙飛燕。洛水一條青，陌上人稱羨。遠望碧雲深，是吾舊宮殿。何人仗忠義，洩我心中怨！,"""Spring and the green of the tender grass,Flushes with joy as the swallows pass;The wayfarers pause by the rippling stream,And their eyes will new born gladness gleam;With lingering gaze the roofs I seeOf the Palace that one time sheltered me.But those whom I sheltered in all righteousness,Let's not stay in silence when the days pass useless?"""
董卓時常使人探聽。是日獲得此詩，來呈董卓。卓曰：「怨望作詩，殺之有名矣。」遂命李儒帶武士十人，入宮弒帝。帝與后、妃正在樓上，宮女報李儒至，帝大驚。儒以鴆酒奉帝，帝問何故。儒曰：「春日融和，董相國特上壽酒。」太后曰：「既云壽酒，汝可先飲。」儒怒曰：「汝不飲耶？」呼左右持短刀白練於前曰：「壽酒不飲，可領此二物！」唐妃跪告曰：「妾身代帝飲酒，願公存母子性命。」儒叱曰：「汝何人，可代王死？」乃舉酒與何太后曰：「汝可先飲！」后大罵何進無謀，引賊入京，致有今日之禍。儒催逼帝，帝曰：「容我與太后作別。」乃大慟而作歌。其歌曰：,"The messenger, sent by Dong Zhuo from time to time to the palace for news of the prisoners, got hold of this poem and showed it to his master. ""So he shows his resentment by writing poems, eh! A fair excuse to put them all out of the way,"" said Dong Zhuo.Li Ru was sent with ten men into the palace to consummate the deed. The three were in one of the upper rooms when Li Ru arrived. The Emperor shuddered when the maid announced the visitor's name. Presently Li Ru entered and offered a cup of poisoned wine to the Emperor. The Emperor asked what this meant.""Spring is the season of blending and harmonious interchange, and the Prime Minister sends a wine cup of longevity,"" said Li Ru.""If it be the wine of longevity, you may share it too,"" said Empress He. Then Li Ru became brutally frank.""You will not drink?"" asked he. He called the men with daggers and cords and bade the Emperor look at them. ""The cup, or these?"" said he.Then said Lady Tang, ""Let the handmaid drink in place of her lord. Spare the mother and her son, I pray!""""And who may you be to die for a prince?"" said Li Ru.Then he presented the cup to the Empress once more and bade her drink. She railed against her brother, the feckless He Jin, the author of all this trouble. She would not drink. Next Li Ru approached the Emperor.""Let me say farewell to my mother,"" begged he, and he did so in these lines:"
天地易兮日月翻，棄萬乘兮退守藩。為巨逼兮命不久，大勢去兮空淚潸！,"""The heaven and earth are changed,Alas! the sun and the moon leave their courses,I, once the center of all eyes, am driven to the farthest confines,Oppressed by an arrogant minister my life nears its end,Everything fails me and vain are my falling tears."""
唐妃亦作歌曰：,Lady Tang sang:
皇天將崩兮，后土頹；身為帝姬兮，恨不隨。生死異路兮，從此別；奈何煢速兮，心中悲！,"""Heaven is to be rent asunder, Earth to fall away,I, handmaid of an emperor, would grieve if I followed him not.We have come to the parting of ways, the quick and the dead walk not together;Alas! I am left alone with the grief in my heart."""
歌罷，相抱而哭。李儒叱曰：「相國立等回報，汝等俄延，望誰救耶？」太后大罵：「董賊逼我母子，皇天不佑！汝等助惡，必當滅族！」儒大怒，雙手扯住太后，直攛下樓，叱武士絞死唐妃，以鴆酒灌殺少帝，還報董卓。卓命葬於城外。自此每夜入宮，姦淫宮女，夜宿龍床。嘗引軍出城，行到陽城地方，時當二月，村民社賽。男女皆集，卓命軍士圍住，盡皆殺之，掠婦女財物，裝載車上，懸頭千餘顆於車下，連軫還都，揚言殺賊大勝而回；於城門下焚燒人頭，以婦女財物分散眾軍。,"When they had sung these lines, they fell weeping into each others' arms. ""The Prime Minister is awaiting my report,"" said Li Ru, ""and you delay too long. Think you that there is any hope of succor?""The Empress broke into another fit of railing, ""The rebel forces us to death, mother and son, and Heaven has abandoned us. But you, the tool of his crime, will assuredly perish!""Thereupon Li Ru grew more angry, laid hands on the Empress and threw her out of the window. Then he bade the soldiers strangle Lady Tang and forced the lad to swallow the wine of death.Li Ru reported the achievement to his master who bade them bury the victims without the city. After this Dong Zhuo's behavior was more atrocious than before. He spent his nights in the Palace, defiled the imperial concubines there, and even slept on the Dragon Couch.Once he led his soldiers out of the city to Yangcheng when the villagers, men and women, were assembled from all sides for the annual spring festival. His troops surrounded the place and plundered it. They took away booty by the cart loads, and women prisoners and more than one thousand severed heads. The procession returned to Capital Luoyang and published a story that they had obtained a great victory over some rebels. They burned the heads beneath the walls, and the women and jewelry were shared out among the soldiers."
越騎校尉伍孚，字德瑜，見卓殘暴，憤恨不平。嘗於朝服內披小鎧，藏短刀，欲伺便殺卓。一日，卓入朝，孚迎至閣下，拔刀直刺卓。卓氣力大，兩手摳住；呂布便入，揪倒伍孚。卓問曰：「誰教汝反？」孚瞪目大喝曰：「汝非吾君，吾非汝臣，何反之有？汝罪惡盈天，人人願得而誅之！吾恨不車裂汝以謝天下！」卓大怒，命牽出剖剮之。孚至死罵不絕口。後人有詩讚之曰：,"A general named Wu Fu was disgusted at this ferocity and sought a chance to slay Dong Zhuo. Wu Fu constantly wore a breastplate underneath his court dress and carried in conceal a sharp dagger. One day when Dong Zhuo came to court, Wu Fu met him on the steps and tried to stab him. But Dong Zhuo was a very powerful man and held Wu Fu off till Lu Bu came to his help. Lu Bu struck down the assailant. ""Who told you to rebel?"" said Dong Zhuo.Wu Fu glared at him and cried, ""You are not my prince, I am not your minister: Where is the rebellion? Your crimes fill the heavens, and every person would slay you. I am sorry I cannot tear you asunder with chariots to appease the wrath of the world!""Dong Zhuo bade the guards take him out and hack him to pieces. Wu Fu only ceased railing as he ceased to live."
漢末忠臣說伍孚，沖天豪氣世間無。朝堂殺賊名猶在，萬古堪稱大丈夫！,"That loyal servant of the latter days of Han.His valor was high as the heavens, in all ages unequaled;In the court itself would he slay the rebel, great is his fame!Throughout all time will people call him a hero."
董卓自此出入常帶甲士護衛。時袁紹在渤海，聞知董卓弄權，乃差人齎密書來見王允。書略曰：卓賊欺天廢主，人不忍言；而公恣其跋扈，如不聽聞，豈報國效忠之臣哉？紹今集兵練卒，欲掃清王室，未敢輕動。公若有心，當乘間圖之。若有驅使，即當奉命。,"Thereafter Dong Zhuo always went well guarded. At Bohai, Yuan Shao heard of Dong Zhuo's misuse of power and sent a secret letter to Minister of the Interior Wang Yun: ""That rebel Dong Zhuo outrages Heaven and has deposed his ruler. Common people dare not speak of him: That is understandable. Yet you suffer his aggressions as if you knew naught of them. How then are you a dutiful and loyal minister? I have assembled an army and desire to sweep clean the royal habitation, but I dare not lightly begin the task. If you are willing, then find an opportunity to plot against this man. If you would use force, I am at your command."""
王允得書，尋思無計。一日，於侍班閣子內見舊臣俱在，允曰：「今日老夫賤降，晚間敢屈眾位到舍小酌。」眾官皆曰：「必來祝壽。」當晚王允設宴後堂，公卿皆至。酒行數巡，王允忽然掩面大哭。眾官驚問曰：「司徒貴誕，何故發悲？」允曰：「今日並非賤降，因欲與眾位一敘，恐董卓見疑，故託言耳。董卓欺主弄權，社稷旦夕難保。想高皇誅秦滅楚，奄有天下；誰想傳至今日，乃喪於董卓之手：此吾所以哭也。」於是眾官皆哭。坐中一人撫掌大笑曰：「滿朝公卿，夜哭到明，明哭到夜，還能哭死董卓否？」允視之，乃驍騎校尉曹操也。允怒曰：「汝祖宗亦食祿漢朝，今不思報國而反笑耶？」操曰：「吾非笑別事，笑眾位無一計殺董卓耳。操雖不才，願即斷董卓頭，懸之都門，以謝天下。」允避席問曰：「孟德有何高見？」操曰：「近日操屈身以事卓者，實欲乘間圖之耳。今卓頗信操，操因得時近卓。聞司徒有七星寶刀一口，願借與操入相府刺殺之，雖死不恨！」允曰：「孟德果有是心，天下幸甚！」遂親自酌酒奉操。操瀝酒設誓，允隨取寶刀與之。操藏刀，飲酒畢，即起身辭別眾官而去。眾官又坐了一回，亦俱散訖。,"The letter arrived but Wang Yun could see no chance to plot against Dong Zhuo. One day while among the throng in attendance, mostly people of long service, Wang Yun said to his colleagues, ""This is my birthday, I pray you come to a little party in my humble cot this evening.""""We certainly will,"" they cried, ""and wish you long life.""That night the tables were spread in an inner room, and his friends gathered there. When the wine had made a few rounds, the host suddenly covered his face and began to weep. The guests were aghast.""Sir, on your birthday too, why do you weep?"" said they.""It is not my birthday,"" replied Wang Yun. ""But I wished to call you together, and I feared lest Dong Zhuo should suspect, so I made that the excuse. This man insults the Emperor and does as he wishes so that the imperial prerogatives are in imminent peril. I think of the days when our illustrious founder destroyed the Qin, annihilated Chu, and obtained the empire. Who could have foreseen this day when that Dong Zhuo has subjugated all to his will? That is why I weep."" Then they all wept with him.Seated among the guests, however, was Cao Cao, who did not join in the weeping but clapped his hands and laughed aloud. ""If all the officers of the government weep till dawn, and from dawn weep till dark, will that slay Dong Zhuo?"" said Cao Cao.Wang Yun turned on him angrily. ""Your forbears ate the bounty of the Hans. Do you feel no gratitude? You can laugh?""""I laughed at the absurdity of an assembly like this being unable to compass the death of one man. Foolish and incapable as I am, I will cut off his head and hang it at the gate as an offering to the people.""Wang Yun left his seat and went over to Cao Cao.""These later days,"" Cao Cao continued, ""I have bowed my head to Dong Zhuo with the sole desire of finding a chance to destroy him. Now he begins to trust me, and so I can approach him sometimes. You have a sword with seven precious jewels which I would borrow, and I will go into his palace and kill him. I care not if I die for it.""""What good fortune for the world that this is so!"" said Wang Yun. With this Wang Yun himself poured out a goblet for Cao Cao who drained it and swore an oath. After this the treasured sword was brought out and given to Cao Cao who hid it under his dress. He finished his wine, took leave of the guests, and left the hall. Before long the others dispersed."
次日，曹操佩著寶刀，來至相府，問丞相何在。從人云：「在小閣中。」操竟入。見董卓坐於床上，呂布侍立於側。卓曰：「孟德來何遲？」操曰：「馬贏行遲耳。」卓顧謂布曰：「吾有西涼進來好馬，奉先可親去揀一騎賜與孟德。」布領令而去。操暗忖曰：「此賊合死！」即欲拔刀刺之。懼卓力大，未敢輕動。卓胖大不耐久坐，遂倒身而臥，轉面向內。操又思曰：「此賊當休矣！」急掣寶刀在手。恰待要刺，不想董卓仰面看衣鏡中，照見曹操在背後拔刀，急回身問曰：「孟德何為？」,"The next day Cao Cao, with this short sword girded on, came to the palace of the Prime Minister. ""Where is the Prime Minister?"" asked he.""In the small guest room,"" replied the attendants.So Cao Cao went in and found his host seated on a couch. Lu Bu was at his side.""Why so late, Cao Cao?"" said Dong Zhuo.""My horse is out of condition and slow,"" replied Cao Cao.Dong Zhuo turned to his henchman Lu Bu. ""Some good horses have come in from the west. You go and pick out a good one as a present for him."" And Lu Bu left.""This traitor is doomed!"" thought Cao Cao. He ought to have struck then, but Cao Cao knew Dong Zhuo was very powerful, and he was afraid to act. He wanted to make sure of his blow. Now Dong Zhuo's corpulence was such that he could not remain long sitting, so he rolled over couch and lay face inwards. ""Now is the time,"" thought the assassin, and he gripped the good sword firmly. But just as Cao Cao was going to strike, Dong Zhuo happened to look up and in a mirror he saw the reflection of Cao Cao behind him with a sword in the hand.""What are you doing, Cao Cao?"" said Dong Zhuo turning suddenly."
時呂布已牽馬至閣外，操惶遽，乃持刀跪下曰：「操有寶刀一口，獻上恩相。」卓接視之，見其刀長尺餘，七寶嵌飾，極其鋒利，果寶刀也；遂遞與呂布收了。操解鞘付布。卓引操出閣看馬。操謝曰：「借願試一騎。」卓就教與鞍轡。操牽馬出相府，加鞭望東南而去。布對卓曰：「適來曹操似有行刺之狀，及被喝破，故推獻刀。」卓曰：「吾亦疑之。」,"And at that moment Lu Bu came along leading a horse. Cao Cao in a flurry dropped on his knees and said, ""I have a precious sword here which I wish to present to Your Benevolence.""Dong Zhuo took it. It was a fine blade, over a foot in length, inlaid with the seven precious signs and very keen —-a fine sword in very truth. Dong Zhuo handed the weapon to Lu Bu while Cao Cao took off the sheath which he also gave to Lu Bu. Then they went out to look at the horse. Cao Cao was profuse in his thanks and said he would like to try the horse. So Dong Zhuo bade the guards bring saddle and bridle. Cao Cao led the creature outside, leapt into the saddle, laid on his whip vigorously, and galloped away eastward.Lu Bu said, ""Just as I was coming up, it seemed to me as if that fellow was going to stab you, only a sudden panic seized him and he presented the weapon instead.""""I suspected him too!"" said Dong Zhuo."
正說話間，適李儒至，卓以其事告之。儒曰：「操無妻小在京，只獨居寓所。今差人往召，如彼無疑而便來，則是獻刀；如推託不來，則必是行刺，便可擒而問也。」卓然其說，即差獄卒四人往喚操。去了良久，回報曰：「操不曾回寓，乘馬飛出東門。門吏問之，操曰：『丞相差我有緊急公事』，縱馬而去矣。」儒曰：「操賊心逃竄，行刺無疑矣。」卓大怒曰：「我如此重用，反欲害我！」儒曰：「此必有同謀者，待拏住曹操便可知矣。」卓遂令遍行文書，畫影圖形，捉拏曹操。擒獻者，賞千金，封萬戶侯；窩藏者同罪。,"Just then Li Ru came in and they told him. ""Cao Cao has no family here in the capital but lodges quite alone and not far away,"" said Li Ru. ""Send for him. If he comes forthwith, the sword was meant as a gift. But if he makes any excuses, he had bad intentions. And you can arrest him.""They sent four prison warders to call Cao Cao. They were absent a long time and then came back, saying, ""Cao Cao had not returned to his lodging but rode in hot haste out of the eastern gate. To the gate commander's questions he replied that he was on a special message for the Prime Minister. He went off at full speed.""""His conscience pricked him and so he fled. There is no doubt that he meant assassination!"" said Li Ru.""And I trusted him so well!"" said Dong Zhuo in a rage.""There must be a conspiracy afoot. When we catch him, we shall know all about it,"" said Li Ru.Letters and pictures of the fugitive Cao Cao were sent everywhere with orders to catch him. A large reward in money was offered and a patent of nobility, while those who sheltered him would be held to share his guilt."
且說曹操逃出城外，飛奔譙郡。路經中牟縣，為守關軍士所獲，擒見縣令。操言：「我是客商，覆姓皇甫。」縣令熟視曹操，沈吟半晌，乃曰：「吾前在洛陽求官時，曾認得汝是曹操，如何隱諱？且把來監下，明日解去京師請賞。」把關軍士賜以酒食而去。,"Cao Cao traveled in hot haste toward Qiao, his home county. On the road at Zhongmou, he was recognized by the guards at the gate and made prisoner. They took him to the Magistrate. Cao Cao declared he was a merchant, named Huang Fu. The Magistrate scanned his face most closely and remained in deep thought. Presently the Magistrate said, ""When I was at the capital seeking a post, I knew you as Cao Cao. Why do you try to conceal your identity?""The Magistrate ordered Cao Cao to the prison till the morrow when he could send Cao Cao to the capital and claim the reward. He gave the soldiers wine and food as a reward."
至夜分，縣令喚親隨人暗地取出曹操，直至後院中審究；問曰：「我聞丞相待汝不薄，何故自取其禍？」操曰：「『燕雀安知鴻鵠志哉！』汝既拏住我，便當解去請賞。」縣令屏退左右，謂操曰：「汝休小覷我。我非俗吏，奈未遇其主耳。」操曰：「吾祖宗世食漢祿，若不思報國，與禽獸何異？吾屈身事卓者，欲乘間圖之，為國除害耳。今事不成，乃天意也！」縣令曰：「孟德此行，將欲何往？」操曰：「吾將歸鄉里，發矯詔，召天下諸侯興兵共誅董卓，吾之願也。」,"About midnight the Magistrate sent a trusty servant to bring the prisoner into his private rooms for interrogation. ""They say the Prime Minister treated you well. Why did you try to harm him?"" said Magistrate.""How can swallows and sparrows understand the flight of the crane and the wild goose? I am your prisoner and to be sent to the capital for a reward. Why so many questions?""The Magistrate sent away the attendants and turning to the prisoner said, ""Do not despise me. I am no mere hireling; only I have not yet found the lord to serve.""Said Cao Cao, ""My ancestors enjoyed the bounty of Han, and should I differ from a bird or a beast if I did not desire to repay them with gratitude? I have bowed the knee to Dong Zhuo that thereby I might find an opportunity against him, and so remove this evil from the state. I have failed for this time. Such is the will of Heaven.""""And where are you going?""""Home to my county. Thence I shall issue a summons calling all the bold people to come with forces to kill the tyrant. This is my desire."""
縣令聞言，乃親釋其縛，扶之上坐，再拜曰：「公真天下忠義之士也！」曹操亦拜，問縣令姓名。縣令曰：「吾姓陳，名宮，字公臺。老母妻子，皆在東郡。今感公忠義，願棄一官，從公而逃。」操甚喜。是夜陳宮收拾盤費，與曹操更衣易服，各背劍一口，乘馬投故鄉來。,"Thereupon the Magistrate himself loosened the bonds of the prisoner, led him to the upper seat, and bowed, saying, ""I am called Chen Gong. My aged mother and family are in the east county of Dongjun. I am deeply affected by your loyalty and uprightness, and I will abandon my office and follow you!""Cao Cao was delighted with this turn of affairs. Chen Gong at once collected some money for the expenses of their journey and gave Cao Cao a different dress. Then each took a sword and rode away toward Qiao."
行了三日，至成皋地方，天色向晚。操以鞭指林深處，謂宮曰：「此間有一人姓呂，名伯奢，是吾父結義弟兄；就往問家中消息，覓一宿，如何？」宮曰：「最好。」二人至莊前下馬，入見伯奢。奢曰：「我聞朝廷遍行文書，捉汝甚急，汝父已避陳留去了。汝如何得至此？」操告以前事，曰：「若非陳縣令，已粉骨碎身矣。」伯奢拜陳宮曰：「小姪若非使君，曹氏滅門矣。使君寬懷安坐，今晚便可下榻草舍。」說罷，即起身入內。良久乃出，謂陳宮曰：「老夫家無好酒，容往西村沽一樽來相待。」言訖，匆匆上驢而去。,"Three days later at eventide they reached Chenggao. Cao Cao pointed with his whip to a hamlet deep in the woods and said, ""There lives my uncle, Lu Boshe, a sworn-brother of my father. Suppose we go and ask news of my family and seek shelter for the night?""""Excellent!"" said his companion Chen Gong, and they rode over, dismounted at the farm gate and entered.Lu Boshe greeted them and said to Cao Cao, ""I hear the government has sent stringent orders on all sides to arrest you. Your father has gone into hiding to Chenliu. How has this all come about?""Cao Cao told him and said, ""Had it not been for this man here with me, I should have been already hacked to pieces.""Lu Boshe bowed low to Chen Gong, saying, ""You are the salvation of the Cao family. But be at ease and rest, I will find you a bed in my humble cottage.""Lu Boshe then rose and went into the inner chamber where he stayed a long time. When he came out, he said, ""There is no good wine in the house. I am going over to the village to get some for you."" And he hastily mounted his donkey and rode away."
操與宮坐久，忽聞莊後有磨刀之聲。操曰：「呂伯奢非吾至親，此去可疑，當竊聽之。」二人潛步入草堂後，但聞人語曰：「縛而殺之，何如？」操曰：「是矣！今若不先下手，必遭擒獲。」遂與宮拔劍直入，不問男女，皆殺之，一連殺死八口。搜至廚下，卻見縛一豬欲殺。宮曰：「孟德心多，誤殺好人矣！」急出莊上馬而行。行不到二里，只見伯奢驢鞍前懸酒二瓶，手攜果菜而來，叫曰：「賢姪與使君何故便去？」操曰：「被罪之人，不敢久住。」伯奢曰：「吾已分付家人宰一豬相款，賢姪、使君何憎一宿？速請轉騎。」,"The two travelers sat a long time. Suddenly they heard at the back of the house the sound of sharpening a knife. Cao Cao said to Chen Gong, ""He is not my real uncle. I am beginning to doubt the meaning of his going off. Let us listen."" So they silently stepped out into a straw hut at the back.Presently someone said, ""Bind before killing, eh?""""As I thought,"" said Cao Cao. ""Now unless we strike first, we shall be taken!""Suddenly Cao Cao and Chen Gong dashed in, sword in hand, and slew the whole household male and female, in all eight persons. After this they searched the house. In the kitchen they found a pig bound ready to kill.""You were too suspicious,"" said Chen Gong, ""and we have slain honest folks!""Cao Cao and Chen Gong at once mounted and rode away. Soon they met their host Lu Boshe coming home, and over the saddle in front of him they saw two vessels of wine. In his hands he carried fruits and vegetables.""Why are you going, Sirs?"" Lu Boshe called to them.""Wanted people dare not linger,"" said Cao Cao.""But I have bidden them kill a pig! Why do you refuse my poor hospitality? I pray you ride back with me."""
操不顧，策馬便行。行不數步，忽拔劍復回，叫伯奢曰：「此來者何人？」伯奢回頭看時，操揮劍砍伯奢於驢下。宮大驚曰：「適纔誤耳，今何為也？」操曰：「伯奢到家，見殺死多人，安肯干休？若率眾來追，必遭其禍矣。」宮曰：「知而故殺，大不義也！」操曰：「寧教我負天下人，休教天下人負我。」陳宮默然。,"Cao Cao paid no heed, urging his horse forward. But he suddenly drew his sword and rode back after Lu Boshe.""Who is that coming along?"" called Cao Cao.Lu Boshe turned and looked back, and Cao Cao at the same instant cut Lu Boshe down.Chen Gong was frightened. ""We were wrong enough before,"" cried Chen Gong. ""What now is this?""""When he got home and saw his family killed, think you he would bear it patiently? If he had raised an alarm and followed us, we should have been killed.""""To kill deliberately is very wrong,"" said Chen Gong.""Rather we let down the world than the world let us down!"" was the reply.Chen Gong only thought."
當夜行數里，月明中敲開客店門投宿。喂飽了馬，曹操先睡。陳宮尋思：「我將謂曹操是好人，棄官跟他；原來是個狠心之徒！今日留之，必為後患。」便欲拔劍來殺曹操。正是：設心狠毒非良士，操卓原來一路人。畢竟曹操性命如何，且聽下文分解。,"They rode on some distance by moonlight and presently knocked up an inn for shelter. Having first fed their horses, Cao Cao was soon asleep, but Chen Gong lay thinking. ""I took him for a true man and left all to follow him, but he is as cruel as a wolf. If I spare him, he will do more harm later,"" thought Chen Gong. And Chen Gong rose intending to kill his companion.In his heart lie cruelty and venom, he is no true man;In nought does he differ from his enemy Dong Zhuo.The further fortunes of Cao Cao will be told in later chapters."
