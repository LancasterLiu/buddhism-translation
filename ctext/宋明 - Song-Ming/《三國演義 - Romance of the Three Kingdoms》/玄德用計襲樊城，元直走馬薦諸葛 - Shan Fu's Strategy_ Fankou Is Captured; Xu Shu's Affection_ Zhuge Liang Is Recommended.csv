卻說曹仁忿怒，遂大起本部之兵，星夜渡河，意欲踏平新野。,"In hot anger, Cao Ren lost no time in marching out to avenge the loss of so many of his army. He hastily crossed the River Yu to attack Xinye and trample it in the dust."
且說單福得勝回縣，謂玄德曰：「曹仁屯兵樊城，今知二將被誅，必起大軍來戰。」玄德曰：「當何以迎之？」福曰：「彼若盡提兵而來，樊城空虛，可乘間襲之。」玄德問計。福附耳低言如此如此。玄德大喜，預先準備已定。忽探馬報說：「曹仁引大軍渡河來了。」單福曰：「果不出吾之料。」遂請玄德出軍迎敵。兩陣對圓，趙雲出馬喚彼將答話。曹仁命李典出陣，與趙雲交鋒。約戰十數合，李典料敵不過，撥馬回陣。雲縱馬追趕，兩翼軍射住，遂各罷兵歸寨。,"When Shan Fu got back into the city, he said to Liu Bei, ""When Cao Ren, now at Fancheng, hears of his losses, he will try to retrieve them and will come to attack us.""""What is the counter move?"" asked Liu Bei.""As he will come with all his force, his own city will be left undefended. We will surprise it.""""By what ruse?""The adviser leaned over and whispered to his chief. Whatever the plan was, it pleased Liu Bei, who made arrangements. Soon the scouts reported Cao Ren crossing the river with a mighty host.""Just as I guessed,"" said Shan Fu, hearing of it.Then he suggested that Liu Bei should lead out one army against the invaders. Liu Bei did so, and, when the formation was complete, Zhao Zilong rode to the front as champion and challenged the other side.Li Dian rode out and engaged. At about the tenth bout Li Dian found he was losing and retired toward his own side. Zhao Zilong pressed after him, but was checked by a heavy discharge of arrows from the wings. Then both sides stopped the battle and retired to their camps."
李典回見曹仁，言：「彼軍精銳，不可輕敵，不如回樊城。」曹仁大怒曰：「汝未出軍時，已慢吾軍心；今又賣陣，罪當斬首！」便喝刀斧手推出李典要斬。眾將苦告方免。乃調李典領後軍，仁自引兵為前部。次日鳴鼓進軍，布成一個陣勢，使人問玄德曰：「識吾陣否？」,"Li Dian reported to his chief: ""Our enemy are brave, very full of spirit, and we will be hard to overcome. We had better retreat to Fancheng and wait for reinforcements.""Cao Ren angrily replied, ""You damped the army's spirit before we started, and now you betray us. You have been bought, and you deserve death.""Cao Ren called in the executioners, and they led away their victim. But the other officers came to intercede, and Li Dian was spared. However, he was transferred to the command of the rear, while Cao Ren himself led the attack.Next day the drums beat an advance and Cao Ren, having drawn up his soldiers, sent a messenger over to ask if Liu Bei recognized his plan of battle array."
單福便上高處觀望畢，謂玄德曰：「此『八門金鎖陣』也。八門者：休、生、傷、杜、景、死、驚、開。如從生門、景門、開門而入則吉，從傷門、驚門、休門而入則傷，從杜門、死門而入則亡。今八門雖布得整齊，只是中間還欠主持。如從東南角上生門擊入，往正西景門而出，其陣必亂。」,"So Shan Fu went on a hill and looked over it.Then he said to Liu Bei, ""The arrangement is called 'The Eight Docked Gates,' and the names of the gates are Birth, Exit, Expanse, Wound, Fear, Annihilation, Obstacle, and Death. If you enter by one of the three Birth, Exit, or Expanse you succeed. If by one of the gates Wound, Fear, or Annihilation, you sustain injuries. The other two gates Obstacles and Death will bring the end. Now, though the eight gates are all there quite correct, the central key-post is lacking, and the whole formation can be thrown into confusion by entry from the southeast and exit due west."""
玄德傳令，教軍士把住陣角，命趙雲引五百軍從東南而入，逕往西出。雲得令，挺槍躍馬，引兵逕投東南角上吶喊，殺入中軍。曹仁便投北走。雲不追趕，卻突出西門，又從西殺轉東南角上來。曹仁軍大亂。玄德麾軍衝擊，曹兵大敗而退。單福命休追趕，收軍自回。,"Wherefore certain orders were issued and Zhao Zilong, leading five hundred troops, rode out on his prancing steed to break the array. He burst in, as directed, at the southeast and, with great clamor and fighting, reached the center. Cao Ren made for the north, but Zhao Zilong, instead of following him, made a dash westward and got through. Thence he turned round to the southeast again and smote till Cao Ren's army was in disarray. Liu Bei gave a general advance signal, and the victory was complete. The beaten enemy retired.Shan Fu forbade pursuit, and they returned. The loss of the battle convinced Cao Ren of the wisdom of his colleague Li Dian, and he sent for Li Dian to consult.""They certainly have some very able person in Liu Bei's army since my formation was so quickly broken,"" said Cao Ren."
卻說曹仁輸了一陣，方信李典之言；因復請典商議，言：「劉備軍中必有能者，吾陣竟為所破。」李典曰：「吾雖在此，甚憂樊城。」曹仁曰：「今晚去劫寨。如得勝，再行計議；如不勝，便退軍回樊城。」李典曰：「不可。劉備必有準備。」仁曰：「若如此多疑，何以用兵？」遂不聽李典之言。自引軍為前隊，使李典為後應，當夜二更劫寨。,"""My chief anxiety is about Fancheng,"" said Li Dian.""I will raid their camp this night,"" said Cao Ren. ""If I succeed, we will decide upon what should be done next. If I fail, we will return to Fancheng.""""Their camp will be well prepared against such a thing, and you will fail,"" said Li Dian.""How can you expect to fight successfully when you are so full of doubts?"" said Cao Ren, angrily.He held no more converse with his cautious colleague, but himself took command of the van and set out. Li Dian was relegated to the rear. The attack on the enemy's camp was fixed for the second watch."
卻說單福正與玄德在寨中議事，忽狂風驟起。福曰：「今夜曹仁必來劫寨。」玄德曰：「何以敵之？」福笑曰：「吾已預算定了。」遂密密分撥已畢。至二更，曹仁兵將近寨，只見寨中四圍火起，燒著寨柵。曹仁知有準備，急令退軍。趙雲掩殺將來。仁不及收兵回寨，急望北河而走。將到河邊，纔欲尋船渡河，岸上一彪軍殺到，為首大將，乃張飛也。曹仁死戰，李典保護曹仁下船渡河。曹軍大半淹死水中。,"Now as Shan Fu was discussing plans with his chief a whirlwind from the northeast went by, which Shan Fu said, ""There will be a raid on the camp tonight.""""How shall we meet it?"" said Liu Bei.""The plans are quite ready,"" was the reply. Shan Fu whispered them to the chief. So at the second watch, when the enemy arrived, they saw fires on all sides, the stockades and huts burning. Cao Ren understood at once that all hope of a surprise was vain, and he turned to get away as quickly as possible. This was the signal for Zhao Zilong to fall on, and that cut Cao Ren's return road. He hastened north toward the river, and reached the bank, but, while waiting for boats to cross the stream, up came Zhang Fei and attacked.By dint of great efforts and with the support of Li Dian, Cao Ren got into a boat, but most of the soldiers were drowned in the stream."
曹仁渡過河面，上岸奔至樊城，令人叫門。只見城上一聲鼓響，一將引軍而出，大喝曰：「吾已取樊城多時矣！」眾驚視之，乃關雲長也。仁大驚，撥馬便走。雲長追殺過來。曹仁又折了好些軍馬，星夜投許昌。於路打聽，方知有單福為軍師，設謀定計。,"As soon as he got to the farther shore, he bolted for Fancheng. He reached the wall and hailed the gate, but, instead of a friendly welcome, he heard the rolling of drums, which was soon followed by the appearance of a body of troops. Guan Yu led them.""I took the city a long time ago!"" shouted Guan Yu.This was a severe shock to Cao Ren, who turned to flee. As soon as he faced about, Guan Yu attacked and killed many of his force."
不說曹仁敗回許昌。且說玄德大獲全勝，引軍入樊城，縣令劉泌出迎。玄德安民已定。那劉泌乃長沙人，亦漢室宗親，遂請玄德到家，設宴相待。只見一人侍立於側，玄德視其人器宇軒昂，因問泌曰：「此何人？」泌曰：「此吾之甥寇封，本羅侯寇氏之子也；因父母雙亡，故依於此。」玄德愛之，欲嗣為義子。劉泌欣然從之，遂使寇封拜玄德為父，改名劉封。玄德帶回，令拜雲長、翼德為叔。雲長曰：「兄長既有子，何必用螟蛉？後必生亂。」玄德曰：「吾待之如子，彼必事吾如父，何亂之有？」雲長不悅。玄德與單福計議，令趙雲引一千軍守樊城。玄德領眾自回新野。,"The remnant hastened to Xuchang. On the road the beaten general wondered who had advised his opponents with such success, and he asked the natives for the answer.While the defeated Cao Ren had to find his way back to the capital, Liu Bei had scored a great success. Afterwards he marched to Fancheng, where he was welcomed by Magistrate Liu Mi, himself a scion of the ruling family, who had been born in Changsha. Liu Mi received Liu Bei as a guest in his own house and gave banquets and treated him exceedingly well.In the train of the Magistrate, Liu Bei saw a very handsome and distinguished-looking young man, and asked who he was.Liu Mi replied, ""He is my nephew, Kou Feng, son of Lord Kou of Luo. I have taken care of him after his parents died.""Liu Bei had taken a great liking for the lad and proposed to adopt him. His guardian was willing, and so the adoption was arranged. The young man's name was changed to Liu Feng. When Liu Bei left, he took his adopted son with him. Liu Feng was then made to bow before Guan Yu and Zhang Fei as uncles.Guan Yu was doubtful of the wisdom of adopting another son, saying, ""You have a son. Why do you think it necessary to adopt another? It may cause confusion.""""How? I shall treat him as a father should, and he will serve me as befits a son.""Guan Yu was displeased.Then Liu Bei and Shan Fu began further discussions of strategy, and they decided to leave Zhao Zilong with one thousand soldiers to guard Fancheng, and they returned to Xinye."
卻說曹仁與李典回許都，見曹操，泣拜於地請罪，具言損將折兵之事。操曰：「勝負乃兵家之常。但不知誰為劉備畫策？」曹仁言是單福之計。操曰：「單福何人也？」程昱笑曰：「此非單福也。此人幼好學擊劍。中平末年，嘗為人報讎殺人，披髮塗面而走，為吏所獲。問其姓名不答，吏乃縳於車上，擊鼓行於市，令市人識之，雖有識者不敢言。而同伴竊解救之，乃更姓名而逃，折節向學，遍訪名師。嘗與司馬徽談論。此人乃潁川徐庶，字元直。單福乃其託名耳。」操曰：「徐庶之才，比君何如？」昱曰：「十倍於昱。」操曰：「惜乎賢士歸於劉備！羽翼成矣，奈何？」昱曰：「徐庶雖在彼，丞相要用，召來不難。」操曰：「安得彼來歸？」昱曰：「徐庶為人至孝。幼喪其父，止有老母在堂。現今其弟徐康已亡，老母無人侍養。丞相可使人賺其母至許昌，令作書召其子，則徐庶必至矣。」,"In the meantime Cao Cao's defeated generals had gone back. When they saw the Prime Minister, Cao Ren threw himself on the ground weeping and acknowledging his faults. He told the tale of his losses.""The fortune of war,"" said Cao Cao.""But I should like to know who laid Liu Bei's plans.""""That was Shan Fu,"" said Cao Ren.""Who is he?"" asked Cao Cao.Cheng Yu said, ""The man is not Shan Fu. When young this man was fond of fencing and used to take up the quarrels of other people and avenge their wrongs. At the end of Emperor Ling, he killed a man to avenge his friend, and then he let down his hair, muddled his face, and was trying to escape when a lictor caught him and questioned him. He would not reply. So they carted him through the streets beating a drum and asking if anyone recognized him. Nobody dared own to knowing him, even if they did so. However, his comrades managed to release him secretly, and he ran away under some other name. Then he turned to study and wandered hither and thither wherever scholars were to be found. He was a regular disputant with Sima Hui. His real name is Xu Shu and he comes from Yingchuan. Shan Fu is merely an assumed name.""""How does he compare with yourself?"" asked Cao Cao.""Ten times cleverer.""""It is a pity. If able people gather to Liu Bei, his wings will soon grow. What is to be done?""""Xu Shu is there now. But if you wanted him, it would not be difficult to call him,"" replied Cheng Yu.""How could I make him come?"" said Cao Cao.""He is noted for his affection for his mother. His father died young, leaving his mother a widow with one other son. Now that son is dead, and his mother, Lady Xun, has no one to care for her. If you sent and got his mother here and told her to write and summon her son, he would surely come."""
操大喜，使人星夜前去取徐庶母。不一日取至。操厚待之，因謂之曰：「聞令嗣徐元直，乃天下奇才也。今在新野，助逆臣劉備，背叛朝廷，正猶美玉落於汙泥之中，誠為可惜。今煩老母作書，喚回許都，吾於天子之前保奏，必有重賞。」,"Cao Cao sent without loss of time and had the old lady brought to the capital, where he treated her exceedingly well.Presently he said, ""I hear you have a very talented son, who is now at Xinye helping on that rebel Liu Bei against the government. There he is like a jewel in a muck heap: It is a pity. Supposing you were to call him, I could speak of him before the Emperor, and he might get an important office."""
遂命左右捧過文房四寶，令徐母作書。徐母曰：「劉備何如人也？」操曰：「沛郡小輩，妄稱皇叔，全無信義，所謂外君子而內小人者也。」徐母厲聲曰：「汝何虛誑之甚也！吾久聞玄德乃中山靖王之後，孝景皇帝閣下玄孫，屈身下士，恭己待人，仁聲素著。世之黃童、白叟、牧子、樵夫皆知其名。真當世之英雄也。吾兒輔之，得其主矣。汝雖託名漢相，實為漢賊，乃反以玄德為逆臣，欲使吾兒背明投暗，豈不自恥乎！」,"Cao Cao bade his secretaries bring along paper and ink, with which Lady Xun could write to her son.""What sort of a man is Liu Bei?"" asked she.Cao Cao replied, ""A common sort of person from Zhuo, irresponsible enough to style himself Imperial Uncle, and so claiming some sort of connection with the Hans. He is neither trustworthy nor virtuous. People say he is a superior man as far as externals go, but a mean man by nature.""Lady Xun answered in a hard voice, ""Why do you malign him so bitterly? Everyone knows he is a descendant of one of the Han princes and so related to the House. He has condescended to take a lowly office and is respectful to all people. He has a reputation for benevolence. Everyone, young and old, cowherds and firewood cutters, all know him by name and know that he is the finest and noblest man in the world. If my son is in his service, then has he found a fitting master. You, under the name of a Han minister, are really nothing but a Han rebel. Contrary to all truths, you tell me Liu Bei is a rebel, whereby you try to induce me to make my son leave the light for darkness. Are you devoid of all sense of shame?"""
言訖，取石硯便打曹操。操大怒，叱武士執徐母出，將斬之。程昱急止之。入諫操曰：「徐母觸忤丞相者，欲求死也。丞相若殺之，則招不義之名，而成徐母之德。徐母既死，徐庶必死心助劉備以報讎矣；不如留之，使徐庶身心兩處，縱使助劉備，亦不盡力也。且留得徐母在，昱自有計賺徐庶至此，以輔丞相。」,"As Lady Xun finished speaking, she picked up the inkstone to strike Cao Cao. This so enraged him that he forgot himself and the need for caution and bade the executioners lead off the old woman and put her to death.Adviser Cheng Yu, however, stopped this act, saying, ""This old lady wished to die. But if you kill her, your reputation will be damaged and hers enhanced. Beside that will add a keen desire for revenge to the motives which led Xu Shu to labor in the interest of Liu Bei. You had better keep her here so that Xu Shu's body and his thoughts may be in different places. He can not devote all his energies to helping our enemy while his mother is here. If you keep her, I think I can persuade the son to come and help you."""
操然其言，遂不殺徐母，送於別室養之。程昱日往問候，詐言曾與徐庶結為兄弟，待徐母如親母；時常餽送物件，必具手啟。徐母因亦作手啟答之。程昱賺得徐母筆跡，乃倣其字體，詐修家書一封，差一心腹人，持書逕奔新野縣，尋問單福行幕。軍士引見徐庶。庶知母有家書至，急喚入問之。來人曰：「某乃館下走卒，奉老夫人言語，有書附達。」庶拆封視之。書曰：,"So the outspoken old lady was saved. She was given quarters and cared for. Daily Cheng Yu went to ask after her health, falsely claiming to being a sworn brother of her son's, and so entitled to serve her and treat her as a filial son would have done. He often sent her gifts and wrote letters to her so that she had to write in reply. And thereby he learned her handwriting so that he could forge a ""home"" letter. When he could do this without fear of detection, he wrote one and sent it by the hand of a trusty person to Xinye.One day a man arrived inquiring for one Shan Fu. He claimed to have a letter from home for him. The soldiers led the man to Shan Fu. The man said he was an official carrier of letters and had been told to bring this one. Shan Fu quickly tore it open and read:"
近汝弟康喪，舉目無親。正悲悽間，不期曹丞相使人賺至許昌，言汝背反，下我於縲絏，賴程昱等救免。若得汝來降，能免我死。如書到日，可念劬勞之恩，星夜前來，以全孝道；然後徐圖歸耕故園，免遭大禍。吾今命若懸絲，專望救援！更不多囑。,"""On your brother's death recently I was left alone: No relative was near, and I was lonely and sad. To my regret, the Prime Minister Cao Cao inveigled me into coming to the capital, and now he says you are a rebel, and he has thrown me into bonds. However, thanks to Cheng Yu, my life has been spared so far, and, if you would only come and submit too, I should be quite safe. When this reaches you, remember how I have toiled for you and come at once, that you may prove yourself a filial son. We may together find some way of escape to our own place and avoid the dangers that threaten me. My life hangs by a thread, and I look to you to save me. You will not require a second summon."""
徐庶覽畢，淚如泉湧，持書來見玄德曰：「某本潁川徐庶，字元直；為因逃難，更名單福。前聞劉景升招賢納士，特往見之。及與論事，方知是無用之人；作書別之，夤夜至司馬水鏡莊上，訴說其事。水鏡深責庶不識主，因說：劉豫州在此，何不事之？庶故作狂歌於市，以動使君。幸蒙不棄，即賜重用。爭奈老母，今被曹操奸計，賺至許昌囚禁，將欲加害。老母手書來喚，庶不容不去。非不欲效犬馬之勞，以報使君；奈慈親被執，不得盡力。今當告歸，容圖後會。」,"Tears gushed from Xu Shu's eyes as he read, and with the letter in his hand he went to seek his chief, to whom he told the true story of his life.""I heard that Liu Biao treated people well and went to him. I happened to arrive at a time of confusion. I saw he was of no use, so I left him very soon. I arrived at the retreat of Sima Hui the Water Mirror late one night and told him, and he blamed me for not knowing a master when I saw one. Then he told me of you and I sang that wild song in the streets to attract your attention. You took me; you used me. But now my aged mother is the victim of Cao Cao's wiles. She is in prison, and he threatens to do worse. She has written to call me, and I must go. I hoped to be able to render you faithful service, but, with my dear mother a captive, I should be useless. Therefore I must leave you and hope in the future to meet you again."""
玄德聞言，大哭曰：「母子乃天性之親，元直無以備為念。待與老夫人相見之後，或者再得奉教。」徐庶便拜謝欲行。玄德曰：「乞再聚一宵，來日餞行。」孫乾密謂玄德曰：「元直天下奇才，久在新野，盡知我軍中虛實。今若使歸曹操，必然重用，我其危矣。主公宜苦留之，切勿放去，操見元直不去，必斬其母。元直知母死，必為母報讎，力攻曹操也。」玄德曰：「不可。使人殺其母，而吾用其子，不仁也；留之不使去，以絕其母子之道，不義也。吾寧死，不為不仁不義之事。」眾皆感歎。玄德請徐庶飲酒，庶曰：「今聞老母被囚，雖金波玉液不能下咽矣。」玄德曰：「備聞公將去，如失左右手，雖龍肝鳳髓，亦不甘味。」,"Liu Bei broke into loud moans when he heard that his adviser was to leave.""The bond between mother and son is divine,"" said Liu Bei, ""and I do not need to be reminded where your duty lies. When you have seen your venerable mother, perhaps I may have again the happiness of receiving your instruction.""Having said farewell, Xu Shu prepared to leave at once. However, at Liu Bei's wish, he consented to stay over the night.Then Sun Qian said privately to his master, ""Xu Shu is indeed a genius, but he has been here long enough to know all our secrets. If you let him go over to Cao Cao, he will be in his confidence, and that will be to our detriment. You ought to keep him at all costs and not let him go. When Cao Cao sees Xu Shu does not come, he will put the mother to death, and that will make Xu Shu the more zealous in your service, for he will burn to avenge his mother's death.""""I cannot do that. It would be very cruel and vile to procure the death of his mother that I might retain the son's services. If I kept him, it would lead to a rupture of the parental lien, and that would be a sin I would rather die than commit.""Both were grieved and sighed.Liu Bei asked the parting guest to a banquet, but he declined, saying, ""With my mother a prisoner I can swallow nothing, nay, though it were brewed from gold or distilled from jewels.""""Alas! Your departure is as if I lost both my hands,"" said Liu Bei. ""Even the liver of a dragon or the marrow of a phoenix would be bitter in my mouth."""
二人相對而泣，坐以待旦。諸將已於郭外安排筵席餞行。玄德與徐庶並馬出城，至長亭，下馬相辭。玄德舉杯謂徐庶曰：「備分淺緣薄，不能與先生相聚，望先生善事新主，以成功名。」庶泣曰：「某才微智淺，深荷使君重用。今不幸半途而別，實為老母故也。縱使曹操相迫，庶亦終身不設一謀。」玄德曰：「先生既去，劉備亦將遠遁山林矣。」庶曰：「某所以與使君共圖王霸之業者，恃此方寸耳。今以老母之故，方寸亂矣，縱使在此，無益於事。使君宜別求高賢輔佐，共圖大業，何便灰心如此？」玄德曰：「天下高賢，無有出先生右者。」庶曰：「某樗櫟庸材，何敢當此重譽。」臨別，又顧謂諸將曰：「願諸公善事使君，以圖名垂竹帛，功標青史，切勿效庶之無始終也。」諸將無不傷感。玄德不忍相離，送了一程。又送一程。庶辭曰：「不勞使君遠送，庶就此告別。」玄德就馬上執庶之手曰：「先生此去，天各一方，未知相會卻在何日！」說罷，淚如雨下。庶亦涕泣而別。,"They looked into each other's eyes and wept. They sat silent till dawn. When all was ready for the journey, the two rode out of the city side by side. At Daisy Pavilion they dismounted to drink the stirrup cup.Liu Bei lifted the goblet and said, ""It is my mean fortune that separates me from you, but I hope that you may serve well your new lord and become famous.""Xu Shu wept as he replied, ""I am but a poor ignorant person whom you have kindly employed. Unhappily I have to break our intercourse in the middle, but my venerable mother is the real cause. Though Cao Cao use all manner of means to coerce me, yet will I never plan for him.""""After you are gone, I shall only bury myself in the hills and hide in the forests,"" said Liu Bei.Xu Shu said, ""I had in my heart for you the position of leader of the chieftains, but my plans have been altogether upset by my mother. I have been of no advantage to you, nor should I do any good by remaining. But you ought to seek some person of lofty wisdom to help you in your great enterprise. It is unseemly to be downcast.""""I shall find none to help better than you, my master.""""How can I permit such extravagant praise?"" said Xu Shu. ""I am only a useless blockhead.""As he moved off, he said to the followers, ""Officers, I hope you will render the Princely One good service, whereby to write his name large in the country's annals and cause his fame to glow in the pages of history. Do not be like me, a person who has left his work half done.""They were all deeply affected. Liu Bei could not bring himself to part from his friend. He escorted him a little further, and yet a little further, till Xu Shu said, ""I will not trouble you, O Princely One, to come further. Let us say our farewell here.""Liu Bei dismounted, took Xu Shu by the hands, and said, ""Alas! We part. Each goes his way, and who knows if we shall meet again?""His tears fell like rain and Xu Shu wept also. But the last goodbyes were said."
玄德立馬於林畔，看徐庶乘馬與從者匆匆而去。玄德哭曰：「元直去矣！吾將奈何？」凝淚而望，卻被一樹林隔斷。玄德以鞭指曰：「吾欲盡伐此處樹木。」眾問何故玄德曰：「因阻吾望徐元直之目也。」,"When the traveler had gone, Liu Bei stood gazing after the little party and watched it slowly disappear. At the last glimpse he broke into lamentation.""He is gone! What shall I do?""One of the trees shut out the traveler from his sight, and Liu Bei pointed at it, saying, ""Wish that I could cut down every tree in the countryside!""""Why?"" said his officers.""Because they hinder my sight of Xu Shu."""
正望間，忽見徐庶拍馬而回。玄德曰：「元直復回，莫非無去意乎？」遂欣然拍馬向前迎問曰：「先生此回，必有主意？」庶勒馬謂玄德曰：「某因心緒如麻，忘卻一語。此間有一奇士，只在襄陽城外二十里隆中。使君何不求之？」玄德曰：「敢煩元直為備請來相見。」庶曰：「此人不可屈致，使君可親往求之。若得此人，無異周得呂望、漢得張良也。」玄德曰：「此人比先生才德何如？」庶曰：「以某比之，譬猶駑馬並麒麟、寒鴉配鸞鳳耳。此人每嘗自比管仲、樂毅；以吾觀之，管、樂殆不及此人。此人有經天緯地之才，蓋天下一人也。」,"Suddenly they saw Xu Shu galloping back.Said Liu Bei, ""He is returning: Can it be that he is going to stay?""So he hastened forward to meet Xu Shu, and when they got near enough, he cried, ""This return is surely for no slight reason.""Checking his horse, Xu Shu said, ""In the turmoil of my feelings, I forgot to say one word. There is a person of wonderful skill living about seven miles from the city of Xiangyang. Why not seek him?""""Can I trouble you to ask him to visit me?""""He will not condescend to visit you. You must go to him. But if he consents, you will be as fortunate as the Zhou when they got the aid of Lu Wang, or the Han when Zhang Liang came to help.""""How does the unknown compare with yourself?""""With me? Compared with him I am as a worn-out carthorse to a palomino, an old duck to a phoenix. This man often compares himself with the ancient sages Guan Zhong and Yue Yi but, in my opinion, he is far their superior. He has the talent to measure the heavens and mete the earth. He is a man who overshadows every other in the world."""
玄德喜曰：「願聞此人姓名。」庶曰：「此人乃瑯琊陽都人，覆姓諸葛，名亮，字孔明。乃漢司隸校尉諸葛豐之後其父名珪，字子貢，為泰山郡丞，早卒。亮從其叔玄。玄與荊州劉景升有舊，因往依之，遂家於襄陽。後玄卒，亮與弟諸葛均躬耕於南陽嘗好為梁父吟。所居之地，有一岡，名臥龍岡，因自號為臥龍先生。此人乃絕代奇才，使君急宜枉駕見之。若此人肯相輔佐，何愁天下不定乎？」玄德曰：「昔水鏡先生曾為備言：『伏龍、鳳雛，兩人得一，可安天下。』今所云莫非即伏龍、鳳雛乎？」庶曰：「鳳雛乃襄陽龐統也。伏龍正是諸葛孔明。」玄德踴躍曰：「今日方知伏龍、鳳雛之語。何期大賢只在目前。非先生言，備有眼如盲也！」後人有讚徐庶走馬薦諸葛詩曰：,"""I would know his name.""""He belongs to Langye, and his name is Zhuge Liang. He is of the family of the former General Zhuge Feng. His father, Zhuge Gui, was the Deputy Governor of Taishan but died young, and the young fellow went with his uncle Zhuge Xuan to Jingzhou. Imperial Protector Liu Biao was an old friend of his uncle, and Zhuge Liang became settled in Xiangyang. Then his uncle died, and he and his younger brother, Zhuge Jun, returned to their farm in Nanyang and worked as farmers. They used to amuse themselves with the composition of songs in the Liangfu style.""On their land was a ridge of hills called the Sleeping Dragon, and the elder of the brothers took it as a name and called himself Master Sleeping Dragon. This is your man. He is a veritable genius. You ought really to visit him. And if he will help you, you need feel no more anxiety about peace in the empire.""""Water Mirror spoke that time of two persons, Sleeping Dragon and Young Phoenix, and said if only one of them could be got to help me all would be well. Surely he, whom you speak of, is one of them.""""Young Phoenix is Pang Tong of Xiangyang, and Sleeping Dragon is Zhuge Liang.""Liu Bei jumped with delight, ""Now at last I know who the mysterious ones are. How I wish they were here! But for you I should have still been an unclued man,"" said he.Someone has celebrated in verse this interview where Xu Shu from horseback recommended Zhuge Liang:"
痛恨高賢不再逢，臨岐泣別兩情濃。片言卻似春雷震，能使南陽起臥龍。,"Liu Bei heard that his able friendMust leave him, with saddened heart,For each to the other had grown very dear,Both wept when it came to part.But the parting guest then mentioned a nameThat echoed both loud and deep,Like a thunder clap in a spring-time sky,And there wakened a dragon from sleep."
徐庶薦了孔明，再別玄德，策馬而去。玄德聞徐庶之語，方悟司馬德操之言，似醉方醒，如夢初覺，引眾將回至新野，便具厚幣，同關、張前去南陽請孔明。,"Thus was Zhuge Liang recommended to Liu Bei, and Xu Shu rode away.Now Liu Bei understood the speech of the hermit Water Mirror, and he woke as one from a drunken sleep. At the head of his officers, he retook the road to the city and having prepared rich gifts set out, with his brothers, for Nanyang."
且說徐庶既別玄德，感其留戀之情，恐孔明不肯出山輔之，遂乘馬直至臥龍岡下，入草廬見孔明。孔明問其來意。庶曰：「庶本欲事劉豫州，奈老母為曹操所囚，馳書來召，只得捨之而往。臨行時，將公薦與玄德。玄德即日將來奉謁，望公勿推阻，即展平生之大才以輔之，幸甚。」,"Under the influence of his emotions at parting, Xu Shu had mentioned the name and betrayed the retreat of his friend. Now he thought of the possibility that Zhuge Liang would be unwilling to play the part of helper in Liu Bei's scheme, so Xu Shu determined to go to visit him. He therefore took his way to Sleeping Dragon Ridge and dismounted at the cottage.Asked why he had come, Xu Shu replied, ""I wished to serve Liu Bei of Yuzhou, but my mother has been imprisoned by Cao Cao, and has sent to call me. Therefore I have had to leave him. At the moment of parting I commended you to him. You may expect him speedily and I hope, Sir, you will not refuse your aid but will consent to use your great talents to help him."""
孔明聞言作色曰：「君以我為享祭之犧牲乎？」說罷，拂袖而入。庶羞慚而退，上馬趲程，赴許昌見母。正是：囑友一言因愛主，赴家千里為思親。未知後事若何，且看下文分解。,"Zhuge Liang showed annoyance and said, ""And so you have made me a victim of the world's sacrifice.""So saying, Zhuge Liang shook out his sleeves and left the room. The guest shamefacedly retired, mounted his horse, and hastened on his way to the capital to see his mother.To help the lord he loved right well,He summoned the aid of anotherWhen he took the distant homeward wayAt the call of a loving mother. What was the sequel will appear in the following chapters."
