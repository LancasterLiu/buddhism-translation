且說董卓字仲顈，隴西臨洮人也。官拜河東太守，自來驕傲。當日怠慢了玄德，張飛性發，便欲殺之。玄德與關公急止之曰：「他是朝廷命官，豈可擅殺？」飛曰：「若不殺這廝，反要在他部下聽令，其實不甘！二兄要便住在此，我自投別處去也！」玄德曰：「我三人義同生死，豈可相離？不若都投別處去便了。」飛曰：「若如此，稍解吾恨。」,"Dong Zhuo was born in the far northwest at Lintao in the West Valley Land. As the Governor of Hedong, Dong Zhuo himself was arrogant and overbearing. But the day he had treated Liu Bei with contumely had been his last, had not Liu Bei and Guan Yu restrained their wrathful brother Zhang Fei.""Remember he has the government commission,"" said Liu Bei. ""Who are we to judge and slay?""""It is bitter to take orders from such a wretch. I would rather slay him! You may stay here if you wish to, but I will seek some other place,"" said Zhang Fei.""We three are one in life and in death; there is no parting for us. We will all go hence.""So spoke Liu Bei, and his brother was satisfied."
於是三人連夜引軍來投朱雋。雋待之其厚，合兵一處，進討張寶。是時曹操自跟皇甫嵩討張梁，大戰於曲陽。這裏朱雋進攻張寶。張寶引賊眾八九萬，屯於山後。雋令玄德為其先鋒，與賊對敵。張寶遣副將高昇出馬搦戰。玄德使張飛擊之。飛縱馬挺矛，與昇交戰，不數合，刺昇落馬。玄德麾軍直衝過去。張寶就馬上披髮仗劍，作起妖法。只見風雷大作，一股黑氣，從天而降：黑氣中似有無限人馬殺來。玄德連忙回軍，軍中大亂，敗陣而歸，與朱雋計議。雋曰：「彼用妖術，我來日可宰豬羊狗血，令軍士伏於山頭；候賊趕來，從高坡上潑之，其法可解。」,"Wherefore all three set out and lost no time in traveling until they came to Zhu Jun, who received them well and accepted their aid in attacking Zhang Bao. At this time Cao Cao had joined himself to Huangfu Song, and they were trying to destroy Zhang Lian, and there was a great battle at Quyang.Zhang Bao was commanding some eighty thousand troops. The rebel had led his army to a strong position in the rear of the hills. An attack being decided upon, Liu Bei was the van leader. On the rebel side a general of Zhang Bao, Gao Sheng, came out to offer battle. Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei to smite Gao Sheng. Out rode Zhang Fei at full speed, his spear ready set. After a few bouts Zhang Fei wounded Gao Sheng, who was unhorsed. At this Liu Bei signaled the main army to advance.Then Zhang Bao, while still mounted, loosened his hair, grasped his sword, and uttered his incantations. Thereupon began the wind to howl and the thunder to roll, while a dense black cloud from the heavens settled upon the field. And therein seemed to be horsemen and footmen innumerable, who swept to attack the imperial troops. Fear came upon them, and Liu Bei led off his troops, but they were in disorder and returned defeated. Zhu Jun and Liu Bei considered the matter.""Zhang Bao uses magic,"" said Zhu Jun. ""Tomorrow, then, will I prepare counter magic in the shape of the blood of slaughtered swine and goats. This blood shall be sprinkled upon their hosts from the precipices above by soldiers in ambush. Thus shall we be able to break the power of their shamanic art."""
玄德聽令，撥關公、張飛各引軍一千，伏於山後高岡之上，盛豬羊狗血並穢物準備。次日，張寶搖旗擂鼓，引軍搦戰，玄德出迎。交鋒之際，張寶作法，風雷大作，飛砂走石，黑氣漫天，滾滾人馬，自天而下。玄德撥馬便走，張寶驅兵趕來。將過山頭，關、張伏軍放起號砲，將穢物齊潑。但見空中紙人草馬，紛紛墜地；風雷頓息，砂石不飛。張寶見解了法，急欲退軍。左關公，右張飛，兩軍都出，背後玄德、朱雋一齊趕上，賊兵大敗。玄德望見地公將軍旗號，飛馬趕來，張寶落荒而走。玄德發箭，中其左臂。張寶帶箭逃脫，走入陽城，堅守不出。朱雋引兵圍住陽城攻打，一面差人打探皇甫嵩消息。,"So it was done. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took each a thousand troops and hid them on the high cliffs behind the hills, and they had a plentiful supply of the blood of swine and goats and all manners of filthy things. And so next day, when the rebels with fluttering banners and rolling drums came out to challenge, Liu Bei rode forth to meet them. At the same moment that the armies met, again Zhang Bao began his magic and again the elements began to struggle together. Sand flew in clouds, pebbles were swept along the ground, black masses of vapor filled the sky, and rolling masses of foot and horse descended from on high. Liu Bei turned, as before, to flee and the rebels rushed on. But as they pressed through the hills, the trumpets blared, and the hidden soldiers exploded bombs, threw down filth and spattered blood. The masses of soldiers and horses in the air fluttered to the earth as fragments of torn paper, the wind ceased to blow, the thunder subsided, the sand sank, and the pebbles lay still upon the ground.Zhang Bao quickly saw his magic had been countered and turned to retire. Then he was attacked on the flanks by Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and in rear by Liu Bei and Zhu Jun. The rebels were routed. Liu Bei, seeing from afar the banner of Zhang Bao The Lord of Earth, galloped toward it but only succeeded in wounding Zhang Bao with an arrow in the left arm. Wounded though he was, Zhang Bao got away into the city of Yangcheng, where he fortified himself and was besieged by Zhu Jun."
探子回報，具說：「皇甫嵩大獲勝捷，朝廷以董卓屢敗，命嵩代之。嵩到時，張角已死；張梁統其眾，與我軍相拒，被皇甫嵩連勝七陣，斬張梁於曲陽。發張角之棺，戮屍梟首，送往京師。餘眾俱降。朝廷加皇甫嵩為車騎將軍，領冀州牧。皇甫嵩又表奏盧植有功無罪，朝廷復盧植原官。曹操亦以有功，除濟南相，即日將班師赴任。」朱雋聽說，催促軍馬，悉力攻打陽城。賊勢危急，賊將嚴政，刺殺張寶，獻首投降。朱雋遂平數郡，上表獻捷。,"Scouts, sent out to get news of Huangfu Song, reported: ""Commander Huangfu Song had been very successful, and Dong Zhuo had suffered many reverses. Therefore the court put Huangfu Song in the latter's place. Zhang Jue had died before Huangfu Song's arrival. Zhang Lian had added his brother's army to his own, but no headway could be made against Huangfu Song, whose army gained seven successive victories. And Zhang Lian was slain at Quyang. Beside this, Zhang Jue's coffin was exhumed, the corpse beheaded, and the head, after exposure, was sent to Capital Luoyang. The common crowd had surrendered. For these services Huangfu Song was promoted to General of the Flying Chariots and the Imperial Protector of Jizhou.""Huangfu Song did not forget his friends. His first act after he had attained to power was to memorialize the Throne concerning the case of Lu Zhi, who was then restored to his former rank for his meritorious conduct. Cao Cao also received advancement for his services and is preparing to go to Jinan to his new post.""Hearing these things Zhu Jun pressed harder yet upon Yangcheng, and the approaching break-up of the rebellion became evident. Then one of Zhang Bao's officers, Yan Zheng, killed his leader and brought the head in token of submission. Thus rebellion in that part of the country was stamped out, and Zhu Jun made his report to the government."
時又黃巾餘黨三人，─趙弘、韓忠、孫仲─，聚眾數萬，望風燒劫，稱與張角報讎。朝廷命朱雋即以得勝之師討之。雋奉詔，率軍前進。時賊據宛城，雋引兵攻之，趙弘遣韓忠出戰。雋遣玄德、關、張攻城西南角。韓忠盡率精銳之眾，來西南角抵敵。朱雋自縱鐵騎二千，逕取東北角。賊恐失城，急棄西南而回。玄德從背後掩殺，賊眾大敗，奔入宛城。朱雋分兵四面圍定，城中斷糧，韓忠使人出城投降。雋不許。玄德曰：「昔高祖之得天下，蓋為能招降納順；公何拒韓忠耶？」雋曰：「彼一時，此一時也。昔秦項之際，天下大亂，民無定主，故招降賞附，以勸來耳。今海內一統，惟黃巾造反；若容其降，無以勸善。使賊得利恣意劫掠，失利便投降：此長寇之志，非良策也。」玄德曰：「不容寇降是矣。今四面圍如鐵桶，賊乞降不得，必然死戰，萬人一心，尚不可當，況城中有數萬死命之人乎？不若撤去東南，獨攻西北。賊必棄城而走，無心戀戰，可即擒也。」,"However, the embers of the Yellow Scarves still smoldered. Three other rebels, Zhao Hong, Han Zhong, and Sun Zhong, gathered some thirty thousand rebels and began to murder and rob and burn, calling themselves the avengers of Master Zhang Jue.The court commanded the successful Zhu Jun to lead his veteran and successful troops to destroy the rebels. He at once marched toward the city of Wancheng which the rebels were holding. When Zhu Jun arrived, Han Zhong went to oppose him. Zhu Jun sent Liu Bei and his brothers to attack the southwest corner of the city. Han Zhong at once led the best of his troops to defend the city. Meanwhile Zhu Jun himself led two thousand of armored horsemen to attack the opposite corner. The rebels, thinking the city being lost, abandoned the southwest and turned back into the city to help the defenders. Liu Bei pressed hotly in their rear, and they were utterly routed. They took refuge in the city which was then invested. When famine pressed upon the besieged, they sent a messenger to offer to surrender, but Zhu Jun refused the offer.Said Liu Bei to Zhu Jun, ""Seeing that the founder of the Han Dynasty, Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor, could welcome the submissive and receive the favorable, why reject these?""""The conditions are different,"" replied Zhu Jun. ""In those old days disorder was universal and the people had no fixed lord. Wherefore submission was welcomed and support rewarded to encourage people to come over. Now the empire is united, and the Yellow Scarves are the only malcontents. To receive their surrender is not to encourage the good. To allow brigands, when successful, is to give way to every license, and to let them surrender when they fail is to encourage brigandage. Your plan is not a good one.""Liu Bei replied, ""Not to let brigands surrender is well. But the city is surrounded as by an iron barrel. If the rebels' request be refused, they will be desperate and fight to the death, and we can hardly withstand a myriad of such men. Moreover, in the city there are many times that number, all doomed to death. Let us withdraw from one corner and only attack the opposite. They will all assuredly flee and have no desire to fight. We shall take them."""
雋然之，隨撤東南二面軍馬，一齊攻打西北。韓忠果引軍棄城而奔。雋與玄德、關、張率三軍掩殺，射死韓忠，餘皆四散奔走。,"Zhu Jun saw that the advice was good and followed it. As predicted the rebels ran out, led by Han Zhong. The besiegers fell upon them as they fled, and Han Zhong was slain. The rebels scattered in all directions."
正追趕間，趙弘、孫仲引賊眾到，與雋交戰。雋見弘勢大，引軍暫退。弘乘勢復奪宛城。雋離十里下寨，方欲攻打，忽見正東一彪人馬到來。為首一將，生得廣額闊面，虎體熊腰；吳郡富春人也：姓孫，名堅，字文臺，乃孫武子之後。年十七歲，與父至錢塘，見海賊十餘人，劫取商人財物，於岸上分贓。堅謂父曰：「此賊可擒也。」遂奮力提刀上岸，揚聲大叫，東西指揮，如喚人狀。賊以為官兵至，盡棄財物奔走。堅趕上，殺一賊。由是郡縣知名，薦為校尉。後會稽妖賊許昌造反，自稱陽明皇帝，聚眾數萬；堅與郡司馬招募勇士千餘人，會合州郡破之，斬許昌并其子許韶。刺史臧旻上表奏其功，除堅為鹽瀆丞，又除盱眙丞、下邳丞。今見黃巾寇起，聚集鄉中少年及諸商旅，并淮泗精兵一千五百餘人，前來接應。,"But the other two rebel chieftains, Zhao Hong and Sun Zhong, came with large reinforcements, and as they appeared very strong, the imperial soldiers retired, and the new body of rebels reentered Wancheng. Zhu Jun encamped three miles from the city and prepared to attack. Just then there arrived a body of horse and foot from the east. At the lead was one general with a broad open face, a body as an alert tiger's, and a torso as a lofty bear's . His name was Sun Jian. He was a native of Fuchun in the old state of Wu, a descendant of the famous Sun Zi the Strategist.When he was seventeen, Sun Jian was with his father on the River Qiantang and saw a party of pirates, who had been plundering a merchant, dividing their booty on the river bank. ""We can capture these!"" said he to his father. So, gripping his sword, he ran boldly up the bank and cried out to this side and that as if he was calling his men to come on. This made the pirates believe the soldiers were on them and they fled, leaving their booty behind them. He actually killed one of the pirates. In this way be became known and was recommended for office.Then, in collaboration with the local officials, he raised a band of one thousand and helped to quell the rebellion of one Xu Chang, who called himself the Sun Emperor and had ten thousand supporters. The rebel's son Xu Hao was also slain with his father. For this Sun Jian was commended by Imperial Protector Zang Min in a memorial to the Throne, and he received further promotion to the post of magistrate of Yandu, then of Xuyi, and then of Xiapi.When the Yellow Scarves rebellion began, Sun Jian gathered together the youths of his village, some of the merchant class, got a troop of one thousand five hundred of veteran soldiers and took the field. Now he had reached the fighting area."
朱雋大喜，便令堅攻打南門，玄德打北門，朱雋打西門，留東門與賊走。孫堅首先登城，斬賊二十餘人，賊眾奔潰。趙弘飛馬突槊，直取孫堅。堅從城上飛身奪弘槊，刺弘下馬；卻騎弘馬，飛身往來殺賊。孫仲引賊突出北門，正迎玄德，無心戀戰，只待奔逃。玄德張弓一箭，正中孫仲，翻身落馬。朱雋大軍，隨後掩殺，斬首數萬級，降者不可勝計。南陽一路，十數郡皆平。雋班師回京，詔封為車騎對軍，河南尹。雋表奏孫堅、劉備等功。堅有人情，除別郡司馬上任去了；惟玄德聽候日久，不得除授。,"Zhu Jun welcomed Sun Jian gladly and ordered him to attack the south gate of Wancheng. The north and the west gates were simultaneously attacked by Liu Bei and Zhu Jun, but the east gate was left free to give the rebels a chance of exit. Sun Jian was the first to mount the wall and cut down more than twenty rebels with his own sword. The rebels ran, but the leader Zhao Hong rode directly at Sun Jian with his spear ready to thrust. Sun Jian leaped down from the wall, snatched away the spear and with it knocked Zhao Hong from the horse. Then Sun Jian, mounting Zhao Hong's horse, rode hither and thither, slaying as he went.The rebels fled north. Meeting Liu Bei, they declined to fight and scattered. But Liu Bei drew his bow, fitted an arrow, and shot their leader Sun Zhong, who fell to the ground. The main army of Zhu Jun came up, and after tremendous slaughter, the rebels surrendered. Thus was peace brought to the ten counties about the Nanyang area.Zhu Jun returned to Capital Luoyang, was promoted to the General of the Flying Cavalry, and received the governorship of Henan. He did not forget those who had helped him to win victory. Thus he reported the merits of Liu Bei and Sun Jian to the Throne.Sun Jian, having influential friends and connections to support him, quickly got an appointment to a post of Commander of Changsha and went to assume the new office. But Liu Bei, in spite of Zhu Jun's memorial, waited in vain for preferment."
三人鬱鬱不樂，上街閒行，正值郎中張鈞車到。玄德見之，自陳功績。鈞大驚，隨入朝見帝曰：「昔黃巾造反，其原皆由十常侍賣官鬻爵，非親不用，非讎不誅，以致天下大亂。今宜斬十常侍，懸首南郊，遣使者布告天下，有功者重加賞賜，則四海自清平也。」十常侍奏帝曰：「張鈞欺主。」帝令武士逐出張鈞。十常侍共議：「此必破黃巾有功者，不得除授，故生怨言。權且教省家銓注微名，待後卻再理會未晚。」因此玄德除授定州中山府安喜縣尉，剋日赴任。玄德將兵散回鄉里，止帶親隨二十餘人，與關、張來安喜縣中到任。署縣事一月，與民秋毫無犯，民皆感化。到任之後，與關、張食則同桌，寢則同床。如玄德在稠人廣坐，關、張侍立，終日不倦。,"The three brothers became very sad. Walking along one day in the capital, Liu Bei met a court official, Zhang Jun, to whom he related his services and told his sorrows. Zhang Jun was much surprised at this neglect and one day at court spoke to the Emperor about it.Said he, ""The Yellow Scarves rebelled because the eunuchs sold offices and bartered ranks. There was employment only for their friends, punishment only for their enemies. This led to rebellion. Wherefore it would be well to slay the Ten Eunuchs and expose their heads and proclaim what had been done throughout the whole empire. Then reward the worthy. Thereby the land would be wholly tranquil.""But the eunuchs fiercely opposed this and said Zhang Jun was insulting the Emperor, and the Emperor bade the guards thrust Zhang Jun out. However, the eunuchs took counsel together and one said, ""Surely someone who rendered some service against rebels resents being passed over.""So they caused a list of unimportant people to be prepared for preferment by and by. Among them was Liu Bei, who received the post of magistrate of the county of Anxi, to which he proceeded without delay after disbanding his army and sending them home to their villages. He retained two dozens or so as escort.The three brothers reached Anxi, and soon the administration of the county was so reformed and the rule so wise that in a month there was no law-breaking. The three brothers lived in harmony, eating at the same table and sleeping on the same couch. But when Liu Bei was in public sessions or in company of others, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei would stand in attendance, were it even a whole day."
到縣未及四月，朝廷降詔，凡有軍功為長吏者當沙汰。玄德疑在遣中。適督郵行部至縣，玄德出郭迎接，見督郵施禮。督郵坐於馬上，惟微以鞭指回答。關、張二公俱怒。及到館驛，督郵南面高坐，玄德侍立階下。良久，督郵問曰：「劉縣尉是何出身？」玄德曰：「備乃中山靖王之後；自涿郡剿戮黃巾，大小三十餘戰，頗有微功，因得除今職。」督郵大喝曰：「汝詐稱皇親，虛報功績！目今朝廷降詔，正要沙汰這等濫官汙吏！」玄德喏喏連聲而退。歸到縣中，與縣吏商議。吏曰：「督郵入威，無非要賄賂耳。」玄德曰：「我與民秋毫無犯，那得財物與他？」次日，督郵先提縣吏去，勒令指稱縣尉害民。玄德幾番自往求免，俱被門役阻住，不肯放參。,"Four months after their arrival, there came out a general order for the reduction of the number of military officers holding civil posts, and Liu Bei began to fear that he would be among those thrown out. In due course the inspecting official, Du Biao by name, arrived and was met at the boundary. But to the polite obeisance of Liu Bei, he made no return, save a wave of his whip as he sat on his horse. This made Guan Yu and Zhang Fei furious. But worse was to follow. When the inspector had arrived at his lodging, he took his seat on the dais, leaving Liu Bei standing below. After a long time he addressed Liu Bei.""Magistrate, what was your origin?""Liu Bei replied, ""I am descended from Prince Sheng of Zhongshan. Since my first fight with the Yellow Scarves rebels at Zhuo County, I have been in some thirty battles, wherein I gained some trifling merit. My reward was this office.""""You lie about your descent, and your statement of services is false!"" roared the inspector. ""Now the court has ordered the reduction of your sort of low class and corrupt officials.""Liu Bei muttered to himself and withdrew. On his return to the magistracy, he took council with his secretaries. ""This pompous attitude only means the inspector wants a bribe,"" said they.""I have never wronged the people to the value of a single coin: Then where is a bribe to come from?""Next day the inspector had the minor officials before him and forced them to bear witness that their master had oppressed the people. Liu Bei time after time went to rebut this charge, but the doorkeepers drove him away and he could not enter."
郤說張飛飲了數盃悶酒，乘馬從館驛前過，見五六十個老人，皆在門前痛哭。飛問其故。眾老人答曰：「督郵逼勒縣吏，欲害劉公；我等皆來苦告，不得放入，反遭把門人趕打！」張飛大怒，睜圓環眼，咬碎鋼牙，滾鞍下馬，逕入館驛，把門人那裏阻擋得住。直奔後堂，見督郵正坐廳上，將縣吏綁倒在地。飛大喝：「害民賊！認得我麼？」督郵未及開言，早被張飛揪住頭髮，扯出館驛，直到縣前馬樁上縛住；扳下柳條，去督郵兩腿上著力鞭打，一連打折柳條十數枝。,"Now Zhang Fei had been all day drowning his sorrow in wine and had drunk far too much. Calling for his horse he rode out past the lodging of the inspector, and at the gate saw a small crowd of white-haired people weeping bitterly. He asked why. They said, ""The inspector has compelled the underlings to bear false witness against our magistrate, with the desire to injure the virtuous Liu Bei. We came to beg mercy for him but are not permitted to enter. Moreover, we have been beaten by the doorkeepers.""This provoked the irascible and half intoxicated Zhang Fei to fury. His eyes opened wide until they became circles; he ground his teeth; in a moment he was off his steed, had forced his way past the scared doorkeepers into the building, and was in the rear apartments. There he saw Imperial Inspector Du Biao sitting on high with the official underlings in bonds at his feet.""Oppressor of the people, robber!"" cried Zhang Fei. ""Do you know me?""But before the inspector could reply, Zhang Fei had had him by the hair and had dragged him down. Another moment he was outside and firmly lashed to the hitching post in front of the building. Then breaking off a switch from a willow tree, Zhang Fei gave his victim a severe thrashing, only staying his hand when the tenth switch was too short to strike with."
玄德正納悶間，聽得縣前喧鬧，問左右，答曰：「張將軍綁一人在縣前痛打。」玄德忙去觀之，見綁縛者乃督郵也。玄德驚問其故。飛曰：「此等害民賊，不打死等甚！」督郵告曰：「玄德公救我性命！」玄德終是仁慈的人，急喝張飛住手。傍邊轉過關公來，曰：「兄長建許多大功，僅得縣尉，今反被督郵侮辱。吾思枳棘叢中，非棲鸞鳳之所；不如殺督郵，棄官歸鄉，別圖遠大之計。」玄德乃取印綬，掛於督郵之頸，責之曰：「據汝害民，本當殺卻；今姑饒汝命。吾繳還印綬，從此去矣！」督郵歸告定州太守，太守申文省府，差人捕捉。玄德、關、張三人往代州投劉恢。恢見玄德乃漢室宗親，留匿在家不題。,"Liu Bei was sitting alone, communing with his sorrow, when he heard a shouting before his door. He asked what the matter was.They told him, ""General Zhang Fei had bound somebody to a post and was thrashing him!""Hastily going outside, Liu Bei saw who the unhappy victim was and asked Zhang Fei the reason.""If we do not beat this sort of wretch to death, what may we expect?"" said Zhang Fei.""Noble Sir, save me!"" cried the inspector.Now Liu Bei had always been kindly and gracious, wherefore he bade his brother release the officer and go his way. Then Guan Yu came up, saying, ""Brother, after your magnificent services you only got this petty post, and even here you have been insulted by this fellow. A thorn bush is no place for a phoenix. Let us slay this fellow, leave here, and go home till we can evolve a bigger scheme.""Liu Bei contented himself with hanging the official seal about the inspector's neck, saying, ""If I hear that you injure the people, I will assuredly kill you. I now spare your life, and I return to you the seal. We are going.""The inspector went to the Governor of Dingzhou and complained, and orders were issued for the arrest of the brothers, but they got away to Daizhou and sought refuge with Liu Hu, who sheltered them because of Liu Bei's noble birth."
卻說十常侍既握重權，互相商議：但有不從己者，誅之。趙忠，張讓，差人問破黃巾將士索金帛，不從者奏罷職。皇甫嵩、朱雋皆不肯與，趙忠等俱奏罷其官。帝又封趙忠等為車騎將軍，張讓等十三人皆封列侯。朝政愈壞，人民嗟怨。於是長沙賊區星作亂；漁陽張舉、張純反：舉稱天子，純稱大將軍。表章雪片告急，十常侍皆藏匿不奏。,"By this time the Ten Regular Attendants had everything in their hands, and they put to death all who did not stand in with them. From every officer who had helped to put down the rebels they demanded presents; and if these were not forthcoming, he was removed from office. Imperial Commanders Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun both fell victims to these intrigues and were deprived from offices, while on the other hand the eunuchs received the highest honors and rewards. Thirteen eunuchs were ennobled, including Zhao Zhong who was added to the rank of General of the Flying Cavalry. The government grew worse and worse, and everyone was irritated. Rebellions broke out in Changsha led by Ou Xing, and in Yuyang led by Zhang Ju and Zhang Chun. Memorials were sent up in number as snow flakes in winter, but the Ten suppressed them all."
一日，帝在後園與十常侍飲宴，諫議大夫劉陶，逕到帝前大慟。帝問其故。陶曰：「天下危在旦夕，陛下尚自與閹官共飲耶！」帝曰：「國家承平，有何危急？」陶曰：「四方盜賊並起，侵掠州郡。其禍皆由十常侍賣官害民，欺君罔上。朝廷正人皆去，禍在目前矣！」十常侍皆免冠跪伏於帝前曰：「大臣不相容，臣等不能活矣！願乞性命歸田里，盡將家產以助軍資。」言罷痛哭。帝怒謂陶曰：「汝亦有近侍之人，何獨不容朕耶？」呼武士推出斬之。劉陶大呼：「臣死不惜！可憐漢室天下，四百餘年，到此一旦休矣！」,"One day the Emperor was at a feast in one of the gardens with the Ten, when Court Counselor Liu Tao suddenly appeared showing very great distress. The Emperor asked what the matter was.""Sire, how can you be feasting with these when the empire is at the last gasp?"" said Liu Tao.""All is well,"" said the Emperor. ""Where is anything wrong?""Said Liu Tao, ""Robbers swarm on all sides and plunder the cities. And all is the fault of the Ten Eunuchs who sell offices and injure the people, oppress loyal officials and deceive their superiors. All virtuous ones have left the services and returned to their places. Misfortune is before our very eyes!""At this the eunuchs pulled off their hats and threw themselves at their master's feet.""If Minister Liu Tao disapproves of us,"" they said, ""we are in danger. We pray that our lives be spared and we may go to our farms. We yield our property to help defray military expenses."" And they wept bitterly.The Emperor turned angrily to Liu Tao, saying, ""You also have servants: Why can't you bear with mine?"" And thereupon the Emperor called to the guards to eject Liu Tao and put him to death.Liu Tao cried aloud, ""My death matters nothing. The pity is that Han Dynasty, after four centuries of reign, is falling fast!"""
武士擁陶出，方欲行刑，一大臣喝住曰：「勿得下手，待我諫去。」眾視之，乃司徒陳耽。逕入室中來諫帝曰：「劉諫議得何罪而受誅？」帝曰：「毀謗近臣，冒朕躬。」耽曰：「天下人民，欲食十常侍之肉，陛下敬之如父母，身無寸功，皆封列侯；況封諝等結連黃巾，欲為內亂：陛下今不自省，社稷立見崩摧矣！」帝曰：「封諝作亂，其事不明。十常侍中，豈無一二忠臣？」陳耽以頭撞階而諫。帝怒，命牽出，與劉陶皆下獄。是夜，十常侍即於獄中謀殺之；假帝韶以孫堅為長沙太守，討區星。,"The guards hustled him away and were just about to carry out the Emperor's order when a minister stopped them, shouting, ""Strike not! Wait till I have spoken with His Majesty.""It was the Minister of the Interior, Chen Dan. He went in to the Emperor, to whom he said, ""For what fault is Counselor Liu Tao to be put to death?""""He has vilified my servants and has insulted me,"" said the Emperor.""All the empire would eat the flesh of the eunuchs if they could, and yet, Sire, you respect them as if they were your parents. They have no merit, but they are created nobles. Moreover, Feng Xu was in league with the Yellow Scarves. Unless Your Majesty looks to it, the state will crumble!""""There was no proof against Feng Xu,"" replied the Emperor. ""About the Ten Eunuchs, are there none faithful among them?""Chen Dan beat his forehead on the steps of the throne and did not desist from remonstrance. Then the Emperor grew angry and commanded his removal and imprisonment with Liu Tao. That night Liu Tao and Chen Dan were murdered.Then the eunuchs sent a forged edict to Sun Jian making him Governor of Changsha, with orders to suppress the rebellion of Ou Xing."
不五十日，報捷，江夏平。詔封堅為烏程侯；封劉虞為幽州牧，領兵往漁陽征張舉、張純。代州劉恢以書薦玄德見虞。虞大喜，令玄德為都尉，引兵直抵賊巢，與賊大戰數日，挫動銳氣。張純專一兇暴，士卒心變，帳下頭目刺殺張純，將頭納獻，率眾來降。張舉見勢敗，亦自縊死。漁陽盡平。劉虞表奏劉備大功，朝廷赦免鞭督郵之罪，除下密丞，遷高堂尉。公孫瓚又表陳玄德前功，薦為別部司馬，守平原縣令。玄德在平原，頗有錢糧軍馬，重整舊日氣象。劉虞平寇有功，封太尉。,"In less than two months Sun Jian reported the county all tranquil. For this he was created Lord of Wucheng. Further, Liu Yu was made Imperial Protector of Youzhou to move against Yuyang and suppress Zhang Ju and Zhang Chun. Liu Hu of Daizhou recommended Liu Bei to Liu Yu. Liu Yu welcomed Liu Bei and gave him rank of Commander and sent him against the rebels. He fought with and worsted them and entirely broke their spirit. Zhang Chun was cruel, and his leaders turned against him. One of his officers then slew him and brought in his head, after which the others submitted. The other leader Zhang Ju saw that all was lost and killed himself.Yuyang being now tranquil, Liu Bei's services were reported to the Throne, and he received full pardon for the insult to the imperial inspector. He was made Deputy Magistrate of Xiami, then Commanding Officer of Gaotang. Then Gongsun Zan praised Liu Bei's former services, and he was promoted to Magistrate of Pingyuan. This place was very prosperous, and Liu Bei recovered something of his old manner before the days of adversity. Liu Yu also received preferment and was promoted to Grand Commander."
中平六年，夏四月，靈帝病篤，召大將軍何進入宮，商議後事。那何進起身屠家；因妹入宮為貴人，生皇子辯，遂立為皇后，進由是得權重任。帝又寵幸王美人，生皇子協。何后嫉妒，鴆殺王美人。皇子協養於董太后宮中。董太后乃靈帝之母，解瀆亭侯劉萇之妻也。初因桓帝無子，迎立解瀆亭侯之子，是為靈帝。靈帝入繼大統，遂迎養母氏於宮中，尊為太后。,"In the summer of the six year of Central Stability (AD 189), Emperor Ling became seriously ill and summoned He Jin into the Palace to arrange for the future. He Jin had sprung from a humble family of butchers, but his sister had become a concubine of rank and borne a son to the Emperor, named Liu Bian. After this she became Empress He, and He Jin became the powerful Regent Marshal.The Emperor had also greatly loved a beautiful girl, Lady Wang, who had borne him a son named Liu Xian. Empress He had poisoned Lady Wang from jealousy, and the baby had been given into the care of Empress Dong, who was the mother of Emperor Ling. Lady Dong was the wife of Liu Chang, Lord of Jiedu. As time went on and the Emperor Huan had no son of his own, he adopted the son of Liu Chang, who succeeded as the Emperor Ling. After his accession, Emperor Ling had taken his own mother into the Palace to live and had conferred upon her the title of Empress Dowager."
董太后嘗勸帝立皇子協為太子。帝亦偏愛協，欲立之。當時病篤，中常侍蹇碩奏曰：「若欲立協，必先誅何進，以絕後患。」帝然其說，因宣進入宮。進至宮門，司馬潘隱謂進曰：「不可入宮：蹇碩欲謀殺公。」進大驚，急歸私宅，召諸大臣，欲盡誅宦官。座上一人挺身百出曰：「宦官之勢，起自沖、質之時；朝廷滋蔓極廣，安能盡誅？倘機不密，必有滅族之禍：請細詳之。」進視之，乃典軍校尉曹操也。進叱曰：「汝小輩安知朝廷大事！」,"Empress Dong had always tried to persuade her son to name Liu Xian as the Heir Apparent, and in fact the Emperor greatly loved the boy and was disposed to do as his mother desired. When his end was near, one of the eunuchs, Jian Shuo, said, ""If Liu Xian is to succeed, He Jin must be killed to prevent any countermeasure.""The Emperor saw this too. And he summoned He Jin to come to him. But at the very gate of the Forbidden City, He Jin was warned of his danger by Commander Pan Yin who said, ""This must be a trap of Jian Shuo to destroy you!""He Jin rushed back to his quarters and called many of the ministers to his side, and they met to consider how to put the eunuchs to death.At this assembly a man spoke against the plot, ""The influence of the eunuchs dates back a century and a half, during the reigns of Emperors Chong and Zhi. It has spread like a noxious weed in all directions. How can we hope to destroy it? Above all keep this plot secret, or our whole clans will be exterminated.""He Jin eyed down and saw General of Military Standards Cao Cao. He Jin was very angry at this speech and cried, ""What do inferiors like you know of the ways of government?"""
正躊躇間，潘隱至，言：「帝已崩。今蹇碩與十常侍商議，秘不發喪，矯詔宣何國舅入宮，欲絕後患，冊立皇子協為帝。」,"And in the midst of the confusion Pan Yin came to say: ""The Emperor is no more. The eunuchs have decided to keep the death a secret and forge a command to the Regent Marshal to come into the Palace to settle the succession. Meanwhile to prevent trouble they have inscribed the name of Prince Xian on the roll."""
說未了，使命至，宣進速入，以定後事。操曰：「今日之計，先宜正君位，然後圖賊。」進曰：「誰敢與吾正君討賊？」一人挺身出曰：「願借精兵五千，斬關入內，冊立新君，盡誅閹豎，掃清朝廷，以安天下！」進視之，乃司徒袁逢之子，袁隗之姪：名紹，字本初，見為司隸校尉。何進大喜，遂點御林軍五千。紹全身披掛。何進引何顒、荀攸、鄭泰等大臣三十餘員，相繼而入，就靈帝柩前，扶立太子辯即皇帝位。,"And as Pan Yin finished speaking, the edict arrived summoning He Jin. ""The matter for the moment is to set up the rightful heir,"" said Cao Cao. ""We can deal with the traitors later.""""Who dare to join me in supporting the rightful heir —-Prince Bian?"" asked He Jin, the Regent Marshal.At once one stood forward, crying, ""Give me five thousand veterans, and we will break into the Palace, set up the true heir, slay the eunuchs, and sweep clean the government! Then peace will come to the empire.""The energetic speaker was Yuan Shao, son of the former Minister of the Interior Yuan Feng and nephew of Imperial Guardian Yuan Wei. Yuan Shao then held the rank of Imperial Commander.He Jin mustered five thousand royal guards. Yuan Shao put on complete armor and took command. He Jin, supported by He Yong, Xun You, Zheng Tai, and more than thirty other ministers and high-rank officials, went into the Palace. In the hall where lay the coffin of the late Emperor, they placed Liu Bian on the throne."
百官呼拜已畢，袁紹入宮收蹇碩。碩慌走入御花園花陰下為中常侍郭勝所殺。碩所領禁軍，盡皆投順。紹謂何進曰：「中官結黨。今日可乘勢盡誅之。」張讓等知事急，慌入告何后曰：「始初設謀陷害大將軍者，止蹇碩一人，並不干臣等事。今大將軍聽袁紹之言，欲盡誅臣等，乞娘娘憐憫！」何太后曰：「汝等勿憂，我當保汝。」傳旨宣何進入。太后密謂曰：「我與汝出身寒微，非張讓等，焉能享此富貴？今蹇碩不仁，既已伏誅，汝何信人言，欲盡誅宦官耶？」,"After the ceremony was over and all had bowed before the new Emperor, Yuan Shao went in to arrest Eunuch Jian Shuo. Jian Shuo in terror fled into the Palace garden and hid among the shrubs, where he was discovered and murdered by Guo Sheng, one of the Ten Eunuchs. The guards under Jian Shuo's command all surrendered. Yuan Shao said, ""Their gangs have broken. The most opportune moment is now to slay all the eunuchs!""But Zhang Rang and the eunuchs of the Ten scented the danger and rushed to see Empress He. They said, ""The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Jian Shuo: Only he was concerned and no other. Now the Regent Marshal, on Yuan Shao's advice, wishes to slay everyone of us. We implore your pity, O Your Majesty!""""Fear not!"" said Empress He, whose son had just become Emperor, ""I will protect you."" She sent for her brother, and said, ""You and I are of lowly origin, and we owe our good fortune to the eunuchs. The misguided Jian Shuo is now dead, and need you really put all the others to death as Yuan Shao advises?"""
何進聽罷，出謂眾官曰：「蹇碩設謀害我，可族滅其家。其餘不必妄加殘害。」袁紹曰：「若不斬草除根，必為喪身之本。」進曰：「吾意已決，汝勿多言。」眾官皆退。,"And He Jin obeyed her wish. He explained to his party, saying, ""The real offender, Jian Shuo, has met his fate, and his clan will be punished. But we need not exterminate the whole party nor injure his colleagues.""""Slay them, root and branch,"" cried Yuan Shao, ""or they will ruin you!""""I have decided,"" said He Jin, coldly. ""Say no more."""
次日，太后命何進參錄尚書事，其餘皆封官職。董太后宣張讓等入宮商議曰：「何進之妹，始初我抬舉他。今日他孩兒即皇帝位，內外臣僚，皆其心腹：威權太重，我將如何？」讓奏曰：「娘娘可臨朝，垂簾聽政；封皇子協為王；加國舅董重大官，掌握軍權；重用臣等：大事可圖矣。」,"Within a few days He Jin became Chair of the Secretariat, and his associates received high offices. Now Empress Dong summoned the eunuch Zhang Rang and his party to a council. Said she, ""It was I who first brought forward the sister of He Jin. Today her son is on the throne, and all the officials are her friends, and her influence is enormous. What can we do?""Zhang Rang replied, ""Your Highness should administer the state from 'behind the veil'; create the late Emperor's son Liu Xian a prince; give your brother, the Imperial Uncle Dong Chong, a high rank, and place him over the army; and use us. That will do it."""
董太后大喜。次日設朝，董太后降旨，封皇子協為陳留王，董重為驃騎將軍，張讓等共預朝政。何太后見董太后專權，於宮中設一宴，請董太后赴席。酒至半酣，何太后起身捧盃再拜曰：「我等皆婦人也，參預朝政，非其所宜。昔呂后因握重權，宗族千口皆被戮。今我等宜深居九重；朝廷大事，任大臣元老自行商議，此國家之幸也。願垂聽焉。」董太后大怒曰：「汝鴆死王美人，設心嫉妒。今倚汝子為君，與汝兄何進之勢，輒敢亂言！吾敕驃騎斷汝兄首，如反掌耳！」何后亦怒曰：「吾以好言相勸，何反怒耶？」董后曰：「汝家屠沽小輩，有何見識！」,"Empress Dong approved. Next day she held a court and issued an edict in the sense proposed. She made Liu Xian Prince of Chenliu and Dong Chong General of the Flying Cavalry, and she allowed the eunuchs again to participate state affairs. When Empress He saw this, she prepared a banquet to which she invited her rival Empress Dong.In the middle of the feast, when all were well warmed with wine, Empress He rose and offered a cup to her guest, saying, ""It is not fitting that we two should meddle in state affairs. In the beginning of the Han Dynasty, when Empress Lu laid hands upon the government, all her clans were put to death. We ought to remain content, immured in our palaces, and leave state affairs to the state officials. That would be well for the country, and I trust you will act thus.""But Empress Dong only got angry, saying, ""You poisoned Lady Wang out of jealousy. Now, relying upon the fact that your son sits on the throne and that your brother is powerful, you speak these wild words. I will command that your brother be beheaded, and that can be done as easily as I turn my hand!""Empress He in her turn became wroth and said, ""I tried to persuade you with fair words. Why get so angry?""""You low born daughter of a butcher, what do you know of offices?"" cried Empress Dong."
兩宮互相爭競，張讓等各勸歸宮。何后連夜召何進入宮，告以前事。何進出，召三公共議：來早設朝，使廷臣奏董太后原係藩妃，不宜久居宮中，合仍遷於河間安置，限日下即出國門。一面遣人起送董后；一面點禁軍圍驃騎將軍董重府宅，追索印綬。董重知事急，自刎於後堂。家人舉哀，軍士方散。張讓、段珪見董后一枝已廢，遂皆以金珠玩好結搆何進弟何曲并其母舞陽君，令早晚入何太后處，善言遮蔽：因此十常侍又得近幸。,"And the quarrel waxed hot. The eunuchs persuaded the ladies to retire. But in the night Empress He summoned her brother into the Palace and told him what had occurred. He went out and took counsel with the principal officers of state. Next morning a court was held and a memorial was presented, saying: ""Empress Dong, being the foster mother of Liu Xian, Prince of Chenliu, a regional prince —-only a collateral —-cannot properly occupy any part of the Palace. She is to be removed into her original fief of Hejian and is to depart immediately.""And while they sent an escort to remove Empress Dong, a strong guard was placed about the Imperial Uncle Dong Chong's dwelling. They took away his seal of office and he, knowing this was the end, killed himself in his private apartments. His dependents, who wailed his death, were driven off by the guards.The eunuchs Zhang Rang and Duan Gui, having lost their patroness, sent large gifts to He Jin's younger brother, He Miao, and his mother, Lady Wuyang, and thus got them to put in a good word to Empress He so as to gain her protection. And so they gained favor once more at court."
六月，何進暗使人酖殺董后於河間驛庭，舉柩回京，葬於文陵。進託病不出，司隸校尉袁紹入見進曰：「張讓、段珪等流言於外，言公酖殺董后，欲謀大事。乘此時不誅閹宦，後必為大禍。昔竇武欲誅內豎，機謀不密，反受其殃。今公兄弟部曲將吏，皆英俊之士；若使盡力，事在掌握。此天贊之時，不可失也。」進曰：「且容商議。」左右密報張讓；讓等轉告何苗，又多送賄賂。苗入奏何后云：「大將軍輔佐新君，不行仁慈，專務殺伐。今無瑞又欲殺十常侍，此取亂之道也。」后納其言。,"In the sixth month of that year, the secret emissaries of He Jin poisoned Empress Dong in her residence in the country. Her remains were brought to the capital and buried in Wen Tombs. He Jin feigned illness and did not attend the funeral.Commander Yuan Shao went one day to see He Jin, saying, ""The two eunuchs, Zhang Rang and Duan Gui, are spreading the report outside that you have caused the death of the late empress and is aiming at the throne. This is an excuse for you to destroy them. Do not spare them this time, or you will pay like Dou Wu and Chen Fan, who in the previous reign missed their chance because the secret had not been kept, and they paid by their own deaths. Now you and your brother have many commanders and officers behind, so that the destruction of the eunuchs can be but an ease. It is a heaven-sent opportunity. Delay no further!""But He Jin replied, ""Let me think it over.""He Jin's servants overheard the discussion and secretly informed the intended victims, who sent further gifts to the younger brother He Miao. Corrupted by these, He Miao went in to speak with his sister Empress He and said, ""The General is the chief support of the new Emperor, yet he is not gracious and merciful but thinks wholly of slaughter. If he slays the eunuchs without cause, it may bring about revolution."""
少頃，何進入白后，欲誅中涓。何后曰：「中官統領禁省，漢家故事。先帝新棄天下，爾欲誅殺舊臣，非重宗廟也。」進本是沒決斷之人，聽太后言，唯唯而出。袁紹迎問曰：「大事若何？」進曰：「太后不允，如之奈何？」紹曰：「可召四方英雄人士，勒兵來京，盡誅閹豎。此時事急，不容太后不從。」進曰：「此計大妙！」便發檄至各鎮，召赴京師。,"Soon after He Jin entered and told her of his design to put the eunuchs to death. She argued with him, ""Those officials look after palace affairs and are old servants. To kill the old servants just after the death of their master would appear disrespectful to the dynasty's ancestral temple."" And as He Jin was of a vacillating mind, he murmured assent and left her.""What about it?"" said Yuan Shao on meeting him.""She will not consent. What can be done?""""Call up an army and slay them. It is imperative. Never mind her consent!""""That is an excellent plan,"" said He Jin. And he sent orders all round to march soldiers to the capital."
主簿陳琳曰：「不可！俗云：『掩目而捕燕雀』，是自欺也。微物尚不可欺以得志，況國家大事乎？今將軍仗皇威，掌兵要，龍驤虎步，高下在心：若欲誅宦官，如鼓洪爐燎毛髮耳。但當速發，行權立斷，則天人順之；卻反外檄大臣，臨犯京闕，英雄聚會，各懷一心：所謂倒持干戈，授人以柄，功必一成，反生亂矣。」何進笑曰：「此懦夫之見也！」傍邊一人鼓掌大笑曰：「此事易如反掌，何必多議！」視之，乃曹操也。正是：欲除君側宵人亂，須聽朝中智士謀。不知曹操說出甚話來，且聽下文分解。,"But Secretary Chen Lin objected, ""Nay! Do not act without due consideration. The proverb says 'To cover the eyes and snatch at swallows is to fool oneself.' If in so small a matter you cannot attain your wish, what of great affairs? Now by virtue of the emperor and with the army under your hand, you are like prancing tiger and soaring dragon: You may do as you please. To use such enormous powers against the eunuchs would bring victory as easily as lighting up a furnace to burn a hair. You only need to act promptly: Use your powers and smite at once, and all the empire will be with you. But to summon forces to the capital, to gather many bold warlords into one spot, each with different schemes, is to turn our weapons against our own person, to place ourselves in the power of another. Nothing but failure can come of it, and havoc will ensue.""""The view of a mere book-worm,"" said He Jin with a smile.Then one of those about He Jin suddenly clapped his hands, laughing, ""Solving this issue is as easy as turning over one's hand! Why so much talk?"" The speaker was Cao Cao.Wouldst thou withdraw wicked people from thy prince's side,Then seek counsel of the wise people of the state.What Cao Cao said will be disclosed in later chapters."
