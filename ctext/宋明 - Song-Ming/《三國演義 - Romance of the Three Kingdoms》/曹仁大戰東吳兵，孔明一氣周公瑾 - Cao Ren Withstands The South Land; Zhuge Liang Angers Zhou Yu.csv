卻說孔明欲斬雲長。玄德曰：「昔吾三人結義時，誓同生死。今雲長雖犯法，不忍違卻前盟。望權記過，容將功贖罪。」孔明方纔饒了。,"Guan Yu would have died there but for his elder brother, who said to Zhuge Liang, ""We three pledged ourselves to live and die together. Although my brother Guan Yu has offended, I cannot bear to break our oath. I hope you will only record this against him and let him atone later for the fault by some specially meritorious service.""So the sentence was remitted."
且說周瑜收軍點將，各各敘功，申報吳侯。所得降卒，盡皆發付渡江。大犒三軍，遂進兵攻取南郡。前隊臨江下寨，前後分五營。周瑜居中。,"In the meantime, Zhou Yu mustered his officers and called over his soldiers, noted the special services of each, and sent full reports to his master. The soldiers who had surrendered were all transported across the river. All this done they spread the feast of victory.The next step was to attack and capture Nanjun. The van of the army camped on the river bank. There were five camps and the Commander-in-Chief's tent was in the center."
瑜正與眾商議征進之策，忽報：「劉玄德使孫乾來與都督作賀。」瑜命請入。乾施禮畢，言：「主公特命乾拜謝都督大德，有薄禮上獻。」瑜問曰：「玄德在何處？」乾答曰：「現移兵屯油江口。」瑜驚曰：「孔明亦在油江否？」乾曰：「孔明與主公同在油江。」瑜曰：「足下先回，某自來相謝也。」,"He summoned his officers to a council. At this moment Sun Qian arrived with congratulations from Liu Bei. Zhou Yu received him and, having saluted in proper form, Sun Qian said, ""My lord sent me on this special mission to felicitate the General on his great virtue and offer some unworthy gifts.""""Where is Liu Bei?"" asked Zhou Yu.""He is now encamped at Youkou, the mouth of River You.""""Is Zhuge Liang there?"" asked Zhou Yu, taken aback.""Both are there,"" said Sun Qian.""Then return quickly, and I will come in person to thank them."""
瑜收了禮物，發付孫乾先回。肅曰：「卻纔都督為何失驚？」瑜曰：「劉備屯兵油江，必有取南郡之意。我等費了許多軍馬，用了許多錢糧，目下南郡垂手可得；彼等心懷不仁，要就見成，須放著周瑜不死！」肅曰：「當用何策退之？」瑜曰：「吾自去和他說話。好便好；不好時不等他取南郡，先結果了劉備！」肅曰：「某願同往。」於是瑜與魯肅引三千輕騎，逕投油江口來。,"The presents handed over, Sun Qian was sent back forthwith to his own camp. Then Lu Su asked Zhou Yu why he had started when he heard where Liu Bei was camped.""Because,"" replied Zhou Yu, ""camping at the mouth of River You means that he has the intention of taking Nanjun. Having spent much military energy and spared no expenditure, we thought the territory should fall to us easily. Those others are opposed to us, and they wish to get the advantage of what we have already accomplished. However, they must remember that I am not dead yet.""""How can you prevent them?"" asked Lu Su.""I will go myself and speak with them. If all goes well, then, let it be so. In case it does not, then I shall immediately settle up with Liu Bei without waiting for Nanjun to be taken.""""I should like to accompany you,"" said Lu Su.The commander and his adviser started, taking with them a guard of three thousand light horse."
先說孫乾回見玄德，言周瑜將親來相謝。玄德乃問孔明曰：「來意若何？」孔明笑曰：「那裏為這些薄禮，肯來相謝。止為南郡而來。」玄德曰：「他若提兵來，何以待之？」孔明曰：「他來便可如此如此答應。」遂於油江口擺開戰船，岸上列著軍馬。,"Having arrived at Youkou, they sought out Sun Qian, who, in turn, went in to see Liu Bei and told him Zhou Yu had come to render thanks.""Why has he come?"" asked Liu Bei of his Directing Instructor.""He is not likely to come out of simple politeness. Surely he has come in connection with Nanjun.""""But if he brings an army, can we stand against it?"" asked Liu Bei.""When he comes, you may reply thus and thus.""Then they drew up the warships in the river and ranged the soldiers upon the bank."
人報：「周瑜，魯肅，引兵到來。」孔明使趙雲領數騎來接。瑜見軍勢雄壯，心甚不安。行至營門外，玄德，孔明迎入帳中。各敘禮畢，設宴相待。玄德舉酒致謝鏖兵之事。,"When the arrival of Zhou Yu was formally announced, Zhao Zilong, with some horsemen, went to welcome him. When Zhou Yu saw what bold soldiers they looked, he began to feel uncomfortable, but he went on his way. Being met at the camp gates by Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang, he was taken in to the chief tent, where the ceremonies were performed and preparations for a banquet had been made.Presently Liu Bei raised his cup in felicitation on the recent victory gained by his guest."
酒至數巡，瑜曰：「豫州移兵在此，莫非有取南郡之意否？」玄德曰：「聞都督欲取南郡，故來相助。若都督不取，備必取之。」瑜笑曰：「吾東吳久欲吞併漢江，今南郡已在掌中，如何不取？」玄德曰：「勝負不可預定。曹操臨歸，今曹仁守南郡等處，必有奇計；更兼曹仁勇不可當；但恐都督不能取耳。」瑜曰：「吾若取不得，那時任從公取。」玄德曰：「孔明，子敬在此為證，都督休悔。」,"The banquet proceeded.After a few more courses Zhou Yu said, ""Of course you are camped here with no other idea than to take Nanjun?""Liu Bei said, ""We heard you were going to take the place and came to assist. Should you not take it, then we will occupy it.""Zhou Yu laughed, saying, ""We of the South Land have long wished for this territory. Now that it is within our grasp, we naturally shall take it.""Liu Bei said, ""There is always some uncertainty. Cao Cao left Cao Ren to guard the region, and you may be certain that there is good strategy behind Cao Ren, to say nothing of his boldness as a warrior. I fear you may not get it.""""Well, if we do not take it then, Sir, you may have it,"" said Zhou Yu.""Here are witnesses to your words,"" said Liu Bei, naming Lu Su, Zhuge Liang, and those at table. ""I hope you will never repent what you have just said."""
魯肅躊躇未對。瑜曰：「大丈夫一言既出，何悔之有！」孔明曰：「都督此言，甚是公論。先讓東吳去取；若不下，主公取之，有何不可？」瑜與肅辭別玄德，孔明，上馬而去。玄德問孔明曰：「卻纔先生教備如此回答，雖一時說了，展轉尋思，於理未然。我今孤窮一身，無置足之地，欲得南郡，權且容身；若先教周瑜取了，城池已屬東吳矣，卻如何得住？」孔明大笑曰：「當初亮勸主公取荊州，主公不聽，今日卻忘耶？」玄德曰：「前為景升之地，故不忍取；今為曹操之地，理合取之。」孔明曰：「不須主公憂慮。儘著周瑜去廝殺，早晚教主公在南郡城中高坐。」玄德曰：「計將安出？」孔明曰：「只須如此如此。」玄德大喜，只在江口屯紮，按兵不動。,"Lu Su stammered and seemed unwilling to be cited as one of the witnesses, but Zhou Yu said, ""When the word of a noble person has gone forth, it is ended. He never regrets.""""This speech of yours, Sir, is very generous,"" interjected Zhuge Liang. ""The South Land shall try first. But if the place does not fall, there is no reason why my lord should not capture it.""The two visitors then took their leave and rode away.As soon as they had left, Liu Bei turned to Zhuge Liang and said, ""O Master, you bade me thus reply to Zhou Yu. But though I did so, I have turned it over and over in my mind without finding any reason in what I said. I am alone and weak, without a single foot of land to call my own. I desired to get possession of Nanjun that I might have, at least, a temporary shelter, yet I have said that Zhou Yu may attack it first. If it falls to the South Land, how can I get possession?""Zhuge Liang laughed and replied, ""First I advised you to attack Jingzhou, but you would not listen. Do you remember?""""But it belonged to Liu Biao, and I could not bear to attack it then. Now it belongs to Cao Cao, I might do so.""""Do not be anxious,"" replied the adviser. ""Let Zhou Yu go and attack it. Some day, my lord, I shall make you sit in the high place thereof.""""But what design have you?""""So and so,"" said Zhuge Liang, whispering.Liu Bei was satisfied with the reply, and only strengthened his position at Youkou."
卻說周瑜，魯肅回寨。肅曰：「都督如何亦許玄德取南郡？」瑜曰：「吾彈指可得南郡，落得虛做人情。」隨問帳下將士：「誰敢先取南郡？」一人應聲而出，乃蔣欽也。瑜曰：「汝為先鋒，徐盛、丁奉為副將，撥五千精銳軍馬，先渡江。吾隨後引兵接應。」,"In the meantime Zhou Yu and Lu Su returned to their own camp, and the latter said, ""Why did you tell Liu Bei that he might attack Nanjun?""""I can take it with a flick of my finger,"" replied Zhou Yu, ""but I just manifested a little pretended kindliness.""Then he inquired among his officers for a volunteer to attack the city. Jiang Qin offered himself, and was put in command of the vanguard, with Xu Sheng and Ding Feng as helpers. He was given five thousand of veterans, and they moved across the river. Zhou Yu promised to follow with supports."
且說曹仁在南郡，分付曹洪守彝陵，以為犄角之勢。人報：「吳兵已渡漢江。」仁曰：「堅守勿戰為上。」驍騎牛金奮然進曰：「兵臨城下而不出戰，是怯也。況吾兵新敗，正當重振銳氣。某願借精兵五百，決一死戰。」,"On the other side Cao Ren ordered Cao Hong to guard Yiling, and so hold one corner of an ox-horn defense.When the news came that the South Land's force had crossed the River Han, Cao Ren said, ""We will defend and not offer battle.""But General Niu Jin said impetuously, ""To let the enemy approach the walls and not offer battle is timidity. Our troops, lately worsted, need heartening and must show their mettle. Let me have five hundred of veterans, and I will fight to a finish."""
仁從之，令牛金引五百軍出戰。丁奉縱馬來迎。約戰四五合，奉詐敗，牛金引軍追趕入陣。奉指揮眾軍一裏圍牛金於陣中。金左右衝突，不能得出。曹仁在城上望見牛金困在垓心，遂披甲上馬，引麾下壯士數百騎出城，奮力揮刀。殺入吳陣。徐盛迎戰，不能抵當。曹仁殺到垓心，救出牛金，回顧尚有數十騎在陣，不能得出，遂復翻身殺入，救出重圍。正遇蔣欽攔路，曹仁與牛金奮力衝散。仁弟曹純，亦引兵接應。混殺一陣，吳軍敗走，曹仁得勝而回。,"Cao Ren could not withstand this offer, and so the five hundred went out of the city. At once Ding Feng came to challenge the leader, and they fought a few bouts. Then Ding Feng pretended to be defeated, gave up the fight, and retreated into his own lines. Niu Jin followed him hard. When he had got within the South Land's formation, at a signal from Ding Feng, the army closed round and Niu Jin was surrounded. He pushed right and left, but could find no way out. Seeing Niu Jin in the toils, Cao Ren, who had watched the fight from the wall, donned his armor and came out of the city at the head of his own bold company of horsemen and burst in among the forces of the South Land to try to rescue his colleague. Beating back Xu Sheng, Cao Ren fought his way in and presently rescued Niu Jin.However, having got out, Cao Ren saw several score of horsemen still in the middle unable to make their way out, whereupon he turned again to the battle and dashed in to their rescue. This time he met Jiang Qin on whom Cao Ren and Niu Jin made a violent attack. Then his brother Cao Chun came up with supports, and the great battle ended in a defeat for the troops of the South Land.So Cao Ren went back victor."
蔣欽兵敗，回見周瑜，瑜怒欲斬之，眾將告免。,The unhappy Jiang Qin returned to report his failure. Zhou Yu was very angry and would have put to death his hapless subordinate but for the intervention of the other officers.
瑜即點兵，要親與曹仁決戰。甘寧曰：「都督未可造次。今曹仁令曹洪據守彝陵，為犄角之勢。某願以精兵三千，徑取彝陵，都督然後可取南郡。」,"Then Zhou Yu prepared for another attack where he himself would lead. But Gan Ning said, ""General, do not be in too great hurry. Let me go first and attack Yiling, the supporting angle of the ox-horn formation. After that the conquest of Nanjun will be easy."""
瑜服其論，先教甘寧引三千兵攻打彝陵。早有細作報知曹仁，仁與陳矯商議。矯曰：「彝陵有失，南郡亦不可守矣。宜速救之。」仁遂令曹純與牛金暗地引兵救曹洪。曹純先使人報知曹洪，令洪出城誘敵。甘寧引兵至彝陵，洪出與甘寧交鋒。戰有二十餘合，洪敗走。寧奪了彝陵。至黃昏時，曹純，牛金兵到，兩下相合，圍了彝陵。,"Zhou Yu accepted the plan and Gan Ning, with three thousand troops, went to attack Yiling.When news of the approaching army reached him, Cao Ren called to his side Chen Jiao, who said, ""If Yiling be lost, then Nanjun is lost too. So help must be sent quickly.""Thereupon Cao Chun and Niu Jin were sent by secret ways to the aid of Cao Hong. Cao Chun sent a messenger to the city to ask that they should cause a diversion by a sortie at the time the reinforcements should arrive.So when Gan Ning drew near, Cao Hong went out to meet and engage him. They fought a score of rounds, but Cao Hong was overcome at last, and Gan Ning took the city. However, as evening fell the reinforcements under Cao Chun and Niu Jin came up, and the captor was surrounded in the city he had taken."
探馬飛報周瑜，說甘寧困於彝陵城中，瑜大驚。程普曰：「可急分兵救之。」瑜曰：「此地正當衝要之處，若分兵去救，倘曹仁引兵來襲，奈何？」呂蒙曰：「甘興霸乃江東大將，豈可不救？」瑜曰：「吾欲自往救之；但留何人在此，代當吾任？」蒙曰：「留凌公續當之。蒙為前驅，都督斷後；不須十日，必奏凱歌。」瑜曰：「未知凌公續肯暫代吾任否？」凌統曰：「若十日為期，可當之；十日之外，不勝其任矣。」,"The scouts went off immediately to tell Zhou Yu of this sudden change of affairs which greatly alarmed him.""Let us hasten to his rescue,"" said Cheng Pu.""Our place is of the greatest importance,"" said Zhou Yu, ""and I am afraid to leave it undefended lest Cao Ren should attack.""""But Gan Ning is one of our first leaders and must be rescued,"" said Lu Meng.""I should like to go myself to his aid, but whom can I leave here in my place?"" said Zhou Yu.""Leave Ling Tong here,"" said Lu Meng. ""I will push on ahead, and you can protect my advance. In less than ten days we shall be singing the paean of victory.""""Are you willing?"" said Zhou Yu to the man who was to act for him.Ling Tong said, ""If the ten-day period is not exceeded, I may be able to carry on for that time. I am unequal to more than that."""
瑜大喜，遂留兵萬餘，付與凌統，即日起大兵投彝陵來。蒙謂瑜曰：「彝陵南僻小路，取南郡極便。可差五百軍去砍倒樹木，以斷其路。彼軍若敗，必走此路。馬不能行，必棄馬而走，吾可得其馬也。」,"Ling Tong's consent pleased Zhou Yu who started at once, leaving ten thousand troops for the defense of the camp.Lu Meng said to his chief, ""South of Yiling is a little-used road that may prove very useful in an attack on Nanjun. Let us send a party to fell trees and barricade this road so that horses cannot pass. In case of defeat, the defeated will take this road and will be compelled to abandon their horses, which we shall capture."""
瑜從之，差軍去訖。大兵將至彝陵，瑜問：「誰可突圍而入，以救甘寧？」周泰願往，即時綽刀縱馬，直殺入曹軍之中，逕到城下。甘寧望見周泰至，自出城迎之。泰言：「都督自提兵至。」寧傳令教軍士嚴裝飽食，準備內應。,"Zhou Yu approved, and the men set out. When the main army drew near Yiling, Zhou Yu asked who would try to break through the besiegers, and Zhou Tai offered himself. He girded on his sword, mounted his steed, and burst straight into the Cao Hong's army. He got through to the city wall. From the city wall Gan Ning saw the approach of his friend Zhou Tai and went out to welcome him. Zhou Tai told him the Commander-in-Chief was on the way to his relief, and Gan Ning at once bade the defenders prepare from within to support the attack of the rescuers."
卻說曹洪，曹純，牛金聞周瑜兵將至，先使人往南郡報知曹仁，一面分兵拒敵。及吳兵至，曹兵迎之。比及交鋒，甘寧，周泰分兩路殺出，曹兵大亂，吳兵四下掩殺。曹洪，曹純，牛金，果然投小路而走；卻被亂柴塞道，馬不能行，盡皆棄馬而走。吳兵得馬五百餘匹。周瑜驅兵星夜趕到南郡，正遇曹仁軍來救彝陵。兩軍接著，混戰一場。天色已晚，各自收兵。,"When the news of the approach of Zhou Yu had reached Yiling, Cao Hong, Cao Chun, and Niu Jin had sent to tell Cao Ren, who was at Nanjun, and at the same time they prepared to repel the assailants.As the army of the South Land came near, they at once attacked. Simultaneously Gan Ning and Zhou Tai went out to attack on two sides, and the troops of Cao Hong were thrown into confusion. The soldiers of the South Land fell on lustily, and the three leaders all fled by a bye road, but, finding the way barred with felled trees and other obstacles, they had to abandon their horses and go afoot. In this way the troops of the South Land gained some five hundred steeds.Zhou Yu, pressing on as quickly as possible toward Nanjun, came upon Cao Ren and his army marching to save Yiling. The two armies engaged and fought a battle which lasted till late in the evening. Then both drew off."
曹仁回城中，與眾商議。曹洪曰：「目今失了彝陵，勢已危急，何不拆丞相遺計觀之，以解此危？」曹仁曰：「汝言正合吾意。」遂拆書觀之，大喜，便傳令教五更造飯；平明，大小軍馬，盡皆棄城；城上遍插旌旗，虛張聲勢，軍分三門而出。,"Cao Ren withdrew into the city. During the night he called his officers to a council.Then said Cao Hong, ""The loss of Yiling has brought us to a dangerous pass. Now it seems the time to open the guide-letter of the Prime Minister, and see what plans he arranged for our salvation in this peril.""""You but say what I think,"" replied Cao Ren.Whereupon he tore open the guide-letter and read it. His face lighted up with joy, and he at once issued orders to have the morning meal prepared at the fifth watch. At daylight the whole army moved out of the city through three gates, but they left a semblance of occupation in the shape of banners on the walls."
卻說周瑜救出甘寧，陳兵於南郡城外。見曹兵分三門而出，瑜上將臺觀看。只見女牆邊虛插旌旗，無人守護；又見軍士腰下各束縛包裏。瑜暗忖曹仁必先準備走路，遂下將臺號令，分布兩軍為左右翼；如前軍得勝，只顧向前追趕，直待鳴金，方許退步。命程普督後軍，瑜親自引軍取城。對陣鼓聲響處，曹洪出馬搦戰。瑜自至門旗下，使韓當出馬，與曹洪交鋒。戰到三十餘合，洪敗走。曹仁自出接戰。周泰縱馬相迎。鬥十餘合，仁亦敗走，陣勢錯亂。,"Zhou Yu went up to the tower of observation and looked over the city. He saw that the flags along the battlements had no guards behind them, and he noticed that all troops carried bundles at their waists behind so that they were ready for a long march.Thought Zhou Yu to himself, ""Cao Ren must be prepared for a long march.""So Zhou Yu went down from the tower of observation and sent out an order for two wings of the army to be ready. One of these was to attack and, in case of its success, the other was to pursue at full speed till the clanging of the gongs should call them to return. He took command of the leading force in person, and Cheng Pu commanded the other. Thus they advanced to attack the city.The armies being arrayed facing each other, the drums rolled out across the plain. Cao Hong rode forth and challenged, and Zhou Yu, from his place by the standard, bade Han Dang respond. The two champions fought near two score bouts, and then Cao Hong fled. Thereupon Cao Ren came out to help him, and Zhou Tai rode out at full speed to meet him. These two exchanged a half score passes and then Cao Ren tied.Cao Ren's army fell into confusion."
周瑜麾兩翼軍殺出，曹軍大敗。瑜自引軍馬追至南郡城下，曹軍皆不入城，望西北而走。韓當，周泰引前部盡力追趕。瑜見城門大開；城上又無人，遂令眾軍搶城。數十騎當先而入。瑜在背後縱馬加鞭，直入甕城。陳矯在敵樓上，望見周瑜親自入城來，暗暗喝采道：「丞相妙策如神！」,"Thereupon Zhou Yu gave the signal for the advance of both his wings, and the forces of Cao Ren were sore smitten and defeated. Zhou Yu pursued to the city wall, but Cao Ren's troops did not enter the city. Instead, they went away northwest. Han Dang and Zhou Tai pressed them hard.Zhou Yu, seeing the city gates standing wide open and no guards upon the walls, ordered the raiding of the city. A few score horsemen rode in first, Zhou Yu followed and whipping his steed. As he galloped into the enclosure around the gate, Chen Jiao stood on the defense tower. When he saw Zhou Yu enter, in his heart he applauded the god-like perspicacity of the Prime Minister Cao Cao."
一聲梆子響，兩邊弓弩齊發，勢如驟雨。爭先入城的，都攧入陷坑內。周瑜急勒馬回時，被一弩箭，正射中左肋，翻身落馬。牛金從城中殺出，來捉周瑜。徐盛，丁奉，二人，捨命救去。城中曹兵突出，吳兵自相踐踏，落塹坑者無數。程普急收軍時，曹洪，曹仁分兵兩路殺回。吳兵大敗。幸得凌統引一軍從刺斜裏殺來，敵住曹兵。曹仁引得勝軍進城，程普收敗軍回寨。丁、徐二將救得周瑜到帳中，喚行軍醫者用鐵鉗子拔出箭頭，將金瘡藥敷掩瘡口，疼不可當，飲食俱廢。醫者曰：「此箭頭上有毒，急切不能痊可。若怒氣沖激，其瘡復發。」程普令三軍緊守各寨，不許輕出。三日後，牛金引軍來搦戰，程普按兵不動。牛金罵至日暮方回，次日又來罵戰。程普恐瑜生氣，不敢報知。第三日，牛金直至寨門外叫罵，聲聲只道要捉周瑜。程普與眾商議，欲暫且退兵，回見吳侯，卻再理會。,"Then was heard the clap-clap of a watchman's rattle. At this signal the archers and crossbowmen let fly, and the arrows and bolts flew forth in a sudden fierce shower, while those who had won their way to the van of the inrush went headlong into a deep trench. Zhou Yu managed to pull up in time, but turning to escape, he was wounded in the left side and fell to the ground. Niu Jin rushed out from the city to capture the chief, but Xu Sheng and Ding Feng at the risk of their lives got him away safe. Then the troops of Cao Ren dashed out of the city and wrought confusion among the troops of the South Land, who trampled each other down and many more fell into the trenches. Cheng Pu tried to draw off, but Cao Ren and Cao Hong came toward him from different directions, and the battle went hardly against the soldiers of Zhou Yu, till help came from Ling Tong, who bore back their assailants. Satisfied with their success, Cao Ren led his forces into the city, while the losers marched back to their own camp.Zhou Yu, sorely wounded, was taken to his own tent and the army physician called in. With iron forceps, he extracted the sharp bolt and dressed the wound with a lotion designed to counteract the poison of the metal. But the pain was intense, and the patient rejected all nourishment.The physician said, ""The missile had been poisoned, and the wound will require a long time to heal. You, General, must be kept quiet and especially free from any irritation, which will cause the wound to reopen.""Thereupon Cheng Pu gave orders that each division was to remain in camp. Three days later, Niu Jin came within sight and challenged the men of the South Land to battle, but they did not stir. The enemy hurled at them taunts and insults till the sun had fallen low in the sky, but it was of no avail and Niu Jin withdrew.Next day Niu Jin returned and repeated his insulting abuse. Cheng Pu dared not tell the wounded general. The third day, waxing bolder, the enemy came to the very gates of the stockade, the leader shouting that he had come for the purpose of capturing Zhou Yu.Then Cheng Pu called together his officers, and they discussed the feasibility of retirement into the South Land that they might seek the opinion of Sun Quan."
卻說周瑜雖患瘡痛，心中自有主張；已知曹兵常來寨前叫罵，卻不見眾將來稟。一日，曹仁自引大軍，擂鼓吶喊，前來搦戰。程普拒住不出。周瑜喚眾將入帳問曰：「何處鼓譟吶喊？」眾將曰：「軍中教演士卒。」瑜怒曰：「何欺我也！吾已知曹兵常來寨前辱罵。程德謀既同掌兵權，何敢坐視？」遂命人請程普入帳問之。普曰：「吾見公瑾病瘡，醫者言勿觸怒，故曹兵搦戰，不敢報知。」瑜曰：「公等不戰，主意若何？」普曰：「眾將皆欲收兵暫回江東。待公箭瘡平復，再作區處。」,"Ill as he was, Zhou Yu still retained control of the expedition. He knew that the enemy came daily to the gates of his camp and reviled him, although none of his officers told him.One day Cao Ren came in person, and there was much rolling of drums and shouting. Cheng Pu, however, steadily refused to accept the challenge and would not let anyone go out.Then Zhou Yu summoned the officers to his bedside and said, ""What mean the drums and the shouting?""""The soldiers are drilling,"" was the reply.""Why do you deceive me?"" said Zhou Yu angrily. ""Do I not know that our enemies come day by day to our gates and insult us? Yet Cheng Pu suffers this in silence and makes no use of his powers and authority.""He sent for Cheng Pu and, when he arrived, asked him why he acted thus.""Because you are ill, and the physician said you were on no account to be provoked to anger. Wherefore, although the enemy challenged us to battle, I kept it from you.""""And if you do not fight, what think you should be done?"" said Zhou Yu.And they all said they desired to return to the South Land till he had recovered from his wound, when they would make another expedition."
瑜聽罷，於床上奮然躍起曰：「大丈夫既食君祿，當死於戰場，以馬革裏屍還，幸也！豈可為我一人，而廢國家大事乎？」言訖，即披甲上馬。諸軍眾將無不駭然，遂引數百騎出營前。望見曹軍已布成陣勢，曹仁自立馬於門旗下，揚鞭大罵曰：「周瑜孺子，料必橫夭，再不敢正覷我兵！」,"Zhou Yu lay and listened. Suddenly he sprang up, crying, ""The noble person who has eaten of his lord's bounty should die in his lord's battles. To return home dead and wrapped in a horse's hide is a happy fate. Am I the sort of people to bring to nought the grand designs of my lord?""So speaking he proceeded to gird on his armor, and he mounted his horse. The wonder of the officers only redoubled when their General placed himself at the head of some hundreds of horsemen and went out of the camp gates toward the enemy, then fully arrayed. Cao Ren, their general, stood beneath the great standard.At sight of the opponents, Cao Ren flourished his whip and began to hurl abuse at them, ""Zhou Yu, you babe! I think your fate has met you. You dare not face my army!"""
罵猶未絕，瑜從群騎內突然出曰：「曹仁匹夫！見周郎否！」曹軍看見，盡皆驚駭。曹仁回顧眾將曰：「可大罵之！」眾軍厲聲大罵。周瑜大怒，使潘璋出戰。未及交鋒，周瑜忽大叫一聲，口中噴血，墜於馬下。曹兵衝來，眾將向前抵住，混戰一場，救起周瑜，回到帳中。,"The stream of insult never ceased.Presently Zhou Yu could stand it no longer. Riding out to the front he cried, ""Here I am, base churl. Look at me!""The whole Cao Ren's army were taken aback. But Cao Ren turned to those about him and said, ""Let us all revile him!""And the whole army yelled insults.Zhou Yu grew angry and sent Pan Zhang out to fight. But before he had delivered his first blow, Zhou Yu suddenly uttered a loud cry, and he fell to the ground with blood gushing from his mouth.At this Cao Ren's army rushed to the battle, and the army of the South Land pressed forward to meet them. A fierce struggle waged around Zhou Yu's body, but he was borne off safely and taken to his tent."
程普問曰：「都督貴體若何？」瑜密謂普曰：「此吾之計也。」普曰：「計將安出？」瑜曰：「吾身本無甚痛楚；吾所以為此者，欲令曹兵知我病危，必然欺敵。可使心腹軍士去城中詐降，說吾已死。今夜曹仁必來劫寨。吾卻於四下埋伏以應之，則曹仁可一鼓而擒也。」程普曰：「此計大妙！」隨就帳下舉起哀聲。眾軍大驚，盡傳言都督箭瘡大發而死，各寨盡皆挂孝。,"""Do you feel better?"" asked Cheng Pu anxiously.""It was a ruse of mine,"" whispered Zhou Yu in reply.""But what avails it?""""I am not suffering, but I did that to make our enemies think I was very ill and so oppose them by deceit. I will send a few trusty men to pretend desertion and tell them I am dead. That will cause them to try a night raid on the camp, and we shall have an ambush ready for them. We shall get Cao Ren easily.""""The plan seems excellent,"" said Cheng Pu.Soon from the tent there arose the sound of wailing as for the dead. The soldiers around took up the cry and said one to another, ""The General is dead of his wound!"" and they all put on the symbols of mourning."
卻說曹仁在城中與眾商議，言周瑜怒氣沖發，金瘡崩裂，以致口中噴血，墜於馬下，不久必亡。,"Meanwhile Cao Ren was consulting with his officers.Said he, ""Zhou Yu lost his temper, and that has caused his wound to reopen and brought on that flow of blood. You saw him fall to the ground, and he will assuredly die soon."""
正論間，忽報：「吳寨內有十數個軍士來降。中間亦有二人，原是曹兵被擄過去的。」曹仁忙喚入問之。軍士曰：「今日周瑜陣前金瘡碎裂，歸寨即死。今眾將皆已挂孝舉哀。我等因受程普之辱，故特歸降，便報此事。」,"Just then there came in one who said that a few men had come over from the enemy asking to be allowed to join the army of Cao Ren. Among them were two of Cao Cao's men who had been made prisoners. Cao Ren sent for the deserters and questioned them.They told him, saying, ""Zhou Yu's wound reopened at his anger, and he died in the camp that day. The leaders are all clothing in white and in mourning. We desert because we have been put to shame by the second in command."""
曹仁大喜，隨即商議今夜便去劫寨，奪周瑜之屍，斬其首級，送赴許都。陳矯曰：「此計速行，不可遲誤。」曹仁遂令牛金為先鋒，自為中軍，曹洪，曹純為合後，只留陳矯領些少軍士守城，其餘軍兵盡起。初更時出城，逕投周瑜大寨。來到寨門，不見一人，但見虛插旗槍而已。情知中計，急忙退軍。四下砲聲齊發，東邊韓當，蔣欽殺來，西邊周泰，潘璋殺來，南邊徐盛，丁奉殺來，北邊陳武，呂蒙殺來。曹兵大敗，三路軍皆被衝散，首尾不能相救。,"Pleased at this news, Cao Ren at once began to arrange to make a night attack on the camp and, if possible, get the head of the dead general to send to the capital.""Success depends upon promptitude, so act without delay,"" said Chen Jiao.Niu Jin was told off as Van Leader, Cao Ren himself led the center, while the rear was commanded by Cao Hong and Cao Chun. Chen Jiao and a small force were left to guard Nanjun.At the first watch they left the city and took the way toward Zhou Yu's camp. When they drew near, not a soldier was visible in the camp, but flags and banners and spears were all there, evidently to keep up an appearance of preparation. Feeling at once that they had been tricked, they turned to retreat.But a bomb exploded, and this was the signal for an attack on all four sides. Han Dang and Jiang Qin pressed in from the east; Zhou Tai and Pan Zhang, from the west; Chen Wu and Lu Meng, from the north; and Xu Sheng and Ding Feng, from the south. The result was a severe defeat for the raiders, and the army of Cao Ren was entirely broken and scattered abroad so that no one part of the beaten army could aid the other."
曹仁引十數騎殺出重圍，正遇曹洪，遂引敗殘軍馬一同奔走。殺到五更，離南郡不遠，一聲鼓響，凌統又引一軍攔住去路，截殺一陣。曹仁引軍刺斜而走，又遇甘寧大殺一陣。曹仁不敢回南郡，逕投襄陽大路而行。吳軍趕了一程，自回。,"Cao Ren, with a few horsemen got out of the press and presently met Cao Hong. The two leaders ran away together, and by the fifth watch they had got near Nanjun. Then they heard a beating of drums, and Ling Tong appeared barring the way. There was a small skirmish, and Cao Ren went off at an angle. But he fell in with Gan Ning, who attacked him vigorously. Cao Ren dared not go back to Nanjun, but he made for Xiangyang along the main road. The forces of the South Land pursued him for a time and then desisted."
周瑜，程普收住眾軍，逕到南郡城下，見旌旗布滿，敵樓上一將叫曰：「都督少罪！吾奉軍師將令，已取城了。吾乃常山趙子龍也。」,"Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu then made their way to Nanjun where they were startled to see flags on the walls and every sign of occupation.Before they had recovered from their surprise, there appeared one who cried, ""Pardon, General! I had orders from the Directing Instructor to take this city. I am Zhao Zilong of Changshan."""
周瑜大怒，便命攻城。城上亂箭射下。瑜命且回商議，使甘寧引數千軍馬，逕取荊州；凌統引數千軍馬，逕取襄陽；然後卻再取南郡未遲。,"Zhou Yu was fiercely angry and gave orders to assault the city, but the defenders sent down flights and flights of arrows, and his troops could not stay near the rampart. So he withdrew and took counsel. In the meantime he decided to send Gan Ning with a force of several thousand to capture Jingzhou City, and Ling Tong with another army to take Xiangyang. Nanjun could be taken later."
正分撥間，忽然探馬飛來報說：「諸葛亮自得了南郡，遂用兵符，星夜詐調荊州守城軍馬來救，卻教張飛襲了荊州。」又一探馬飛來報說：「夏侯惇在襄陽，被諸葛亮差人齎兵符，詐稱曹仁求救，誘惇引兵出，卻教雲長襲取了襄陽。」二處城池，全不費力，皆屬劉玄德矣。」周瑜曰：「諸葛亮怎得兵符？」程普曰：「他拏住陳矯，兵符自然盡屬之矣。」周瑜大叫一聲，金瘡迸裂。正是：幾郡城池無我分，一場辛苦為誰忙。未知性命如何，且看下文分解。,"But even as these orders were being given, the scouts came in hurriedly to report, saying, ""After Nanjun fell, Zhuge Liang, suddenly forging a military commission, induced the guards of Jingzhou City to leave it and go to the rescue of Cao Ren. Whereupon Zhang Fei occupied the capital.""Soon after another messenger came, saying, ""Xiahou Dun, at Xiangyang, received from Zhuge Liang dispatches, supported by a commission in due form, saying that Cao Ren was in danger and needed help, whereupon Xiahou Dun marched off, and Guan Yu seized that city.""Thus the two cities that Zhou Yu wanted had fallen, without the least effort, into the hands of his rival Liu Bei.""How did Zhuge Liang get this military commission with which he has imposed on the generals?"" asked Zhou Yu.Cheng Pu replied, ""He seized that of Chen Jiao and so has got all this region into his power.""Zhou Yu uttered a great cry, for at that moment his wound had suddenly burst open.A city falls, but not to us the gain;The guerdon is another's; ours the pain."
