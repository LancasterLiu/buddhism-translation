卻說李樂引軍詐稱李傕、郭汜來追車駕，天子大驚。楊奉曰：「此李樂也。」遂令徐晃出迎之，李樂親自出戰。兩馬相交，只一合，被徐晃一斧砍於馬下，殺散餘黨，保護車駕過箕關。太守張揚具粟帛迎駕於軹道。帝封張揚為大司馬。楊辭帝屯兵野王去了。,"The last chapter closed with the arrival of Li Yue who shouted out falsely that the army was that of the two arch rebels Li Jue and Guo Si come to capture the imperial cavalcade.But Yang Feng recognized the voice of Li Yue and said, ""This is only the cohort of Li Yue!""He bade Xu Huang go out to fight him. Xu Huang went and in the first bout the traitor fell. The White Wave rebels scattered.The travelers got safely through Gu Pass. Here the Governor of Henei, Zhang Yang, supplied them plentifully with food and other necessaries and escorted the Emperor to Zhidao. For his timely help, the Emperor conferred upon Zhang Yang the rank of a Regent General. Yang Feng moved his army to the northeast of Luoyang and camped at Yewang."
帝入洛陽，見宮室燒盡，街市荒蕪，滿目皆是蒿草，宮院中只有頹牆壞壁，命楊奉且蓋小宮居住。百官朝賀，皆立於荊棘之中。詔改興平為建安元年。,"Capital Luoyang was presently entered. Within the walls all was destruction. The palaces and halls had been burned, the streets were overgrown with grass and brambles and obstructed by heaps of ruins. The palaces and courts were represented by broken roofs and toppling walls. A small ""palace"" however was soon built, and therein the officers of court presented their congratulations, standing in the open air among thorn bushes and brambles. The reign style was changed from Prosperous Stability to Rebuilt Tranquillity, the first year (AD 196)."
是歲又大荒。洛陽居民，僅有數百家，無可為食，盡出城去剝樹皮掘草根食之。尚書郎以下，皆自出城樵採，多有死於頹牆壞壁之間者。漢末氣運之衰，無甚於此。後人有詩歎之曰：,"The year was grievous with famine. The Luoyang people, even reduced in numbers as they were to a few hundred families, had not enough to eat and they prowled about stripping the bark off trees and grubbing up the roots of plants to satisfy their starving hunger. Officers of the government of all but the highest ranks went out into the country to gather fuel. Many people were crushed by the falling walls of burned houses. At no time during the decadence of Han did misery press harder than at this period.A poem written in pity for the sufferings of that time says:"
血流芒碭白蛇亡，赤幟縱橫遊四方。秦鹿逐翻興社稷，楚騅推倒立封疆。天子懦弱姦邪起，宗社凋零盜賊狂。看到兩京遭難處，鐵人無淚也悽惶。,"Mortally wounded, the white serpent poured forth its life blood at Mangdang Hills;Blood-red pennons of war waved then in every quarter,Chieftain with chieftain strove and raided each other's borders,Midst the turmoil and strife the Kingship even was threatened.Wickedness stalks in a country when the King is a weakling,Brigandage always is rife, when a dynasty's failing,Had one a heart of iron, wholly devoid of feeling,Yet would one surely grieve at the sight of such desolation."
太尉楊彪奏帝曰：「前蒙降詔，未曾發遣。今曹操在山東，兵強將盛，可宣入朝，以輔王室。」帝曰：「朕前既降詔，卿何必再奏？今即差人前去便了。」彪領旨，即差使命赴山東，宣召曹操。,"Imperial Guardian Yang Biao memorialized the Throne, saying, ""The decree issued to me some time ago has never been acted upon. Now Cao Cao is very strong in the Shandong Mountains, and it would be well to associate him in the government that he might support the ruling house.""The Emperor replied, ""There was no need to refer to the matter again. Send a messenger when you will.""So the decree went forth and a messenger bore it into the Shandong Mountains."
卻說曹操在山東，聞知車駕已還洛陽，聚謀士商議。荀彧進曰：「昔晉文公納周襄王，而諸侯服從；漢高祖為義帝發喪，而天下歸心；今天子蒙塵，將軍誠因此時首倡義兵，奉天子以從眾望，不世之略也。若不早圖，人將先我而為之矣。」曹操大喜。正要收拾起兵，忽報有天使齎詔宣召。操接詔，剋日興師。,"Now when Cao Cao had heard that the court had returned to Capital Luoyang, he called together his advisers to consult.Xun Yu laid the matter before Cao Cao and the council thus: ""Eight hundred years ago, Duke Wen of Jin supported Prince Xiang of the declining Zhou Dynasty, and all the feudal lords backed Duke Wen. The Founder of the Hans, Liu Bang, won the popular favor by wearing mourning for Emperor Yi of Chu. Now Emperor Xian has been a fugitive on the dusty roads. To take the lead in offering an army to restore him to honor is to have an unrivaled opportunity to win universal regard. But you must act quickly, or someone will get in before you!""Cao Cao understood and at once prepared his army to move. Just at this moment an imperial messenger was announced with the very command Cao Cao wanted, and Cao Cao immediately set out."
卻說帝在洛陽，百事未備，城郭崩倒，欲修未能。人報李傕、郭汜領兵將到。帝大驚，問楊奉曰：「山東之使未回，李、郭之兵又至，為之奈何？」楊奉，韓暹曰：「臣願與賊決死戰，以保陛下。」董承曰：「城郭不堅，兵甲不多，戰如不勝，當復如何？不若且奉駕往山東避之。」帝從其言，即日起駕望山東進發。百官無馬，皆隨駕步行。,"At Luoyang everything was desolate. The walls had fallen, and there were no means of rebuilding them, while rumors and reports of the coming of Li Jue and Guo Si kept up a state of constant anxiety.The frightened Emperor spoke with Yang Feng, saying, ""What can be done? There is no answer from the East of Huashan, and our enemies are near!""Then Yang Feng and Han Xian said, ""We, your ministers, will fight to the death for you!""But Dong Cheng said, ""The fortifications are weak and our military resources small, so that we cannot hope for victory, and what does defeat mean? I see nothing better to propose than a move into the East of Huashan Mountains.""The Emperor agreed to this, and the journey began without further preparation. There being few horses, the officers of the court had to march afoot."
出了洛陽，行無一箭之地，但見塵頭蔽日，金鼓喧天，無限人馬到來，帝、后戰慄不能言。忽見一騎飛來，乃前差往山東之使命也；至車前拜啟曰：「曹將軍盡起山東之兵，應詔前來。聞李傕、郭汜犯洛陽，先差夏侯惇為先鋒，引上將十員，精兵五萬，前來保駕。」帝心方安。少頃，夏侯惇引許褚，典韋等，至駕前面君，俱以軍禮見。帝慰諭方畢，忽報正東又有一路軍到。帝即命夏侯惇往探之，回奏曰：「乃曹操步軍也。」,"Leaving Luoyang, hardly a bowshot outside the gate they saw a thick cloud of dust out of which came all the clash and clamor of an advancing army. The Emperor and his Consort were dumb with fear. Then appeared a horseman; he was the messenger returning from the East of Huashan Mountains.He rode up to the chariot, made an obeisance, and said, ""General Cao Cao, as commanded, is coming with all the military force of the East of Huashan; but hearing that Li Jue and Guo Si had again approached the capital, he has sent Xiahou Dun in advance. With Xiahou Dun are ten capable leaders and fifty thousand cavalry. They will guard Your Majesty.""All fear was swept away. Soon after Xiahou Dun and his staff arrived. Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, and Dian Wei were presented to the Emperor, who graciously addressed them. Then one came to say a large army was approaching from the east, and at the Emperor's command Xiahou Dun went to ascertain who these were. He soon returned saying they were Cao Cao's infantry."
須臾，曹洪，李典，樂進，來見駕。通名畢，洪奏曰：「臣兄知賊兵至近，恐夏侯惇孤力難為，故又差臣等倍道而來協助。」帝曰：「曹將軍真社稷臣也！」遂命護駕前行。探馬來報：「李傕，郭汜，領兵長驅而來。」帝令夏侯惇分兩路迎之。惇乃與曹洪分為兩翼，馬軍先出，步軍後隨，儘力攻擊。傕、汜賊兵大敗，斬首萬餘。於是還洛陽故宮。夏侯惇屯兵於城外。,"In a short time Cao Hong, Li Dian, and Yue Jing came to the imperial chariot and their names having been duly communicated, Cao Hong said, ""When my brother, Cao Cao, heard of the approach of the rebels, he feared that the advance guard he had sent might be too weak, so he sent me to march quickly for reinforcement.""""General Cao Cao is indeed a trusty servant!"" said the Emperor.Orders were given to advance, Cao Hong leading the escort. By and by scouts came to say that the rebels were coming up very quickly. The Emperor bade Xiahou Dun divide his force into two parts to oppose them. Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong's armies threw out two wings with cavalry in front and foot behind. They attacked with vigor and beat off Li Jue and Guo Si's cohorts with a severe loss of ten thousand. Then Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong begged the Emperor to return to Luoyang, and Xiahou Dun guarded the city."
次日，曹操引大隊人馬到來。安營畢，入城見帝，拜於殿階之下。帝賜平身，宣諭慰勞。操曰：「臣向蒙國恩，刻思圖報。今傕、汜二賊，罪惡貫盈；臣有精兵二十餘萬，以順討逆，無不克捷。陛下善保龍體，以社稷為重。」帝乃封操領司隸校尉，假節鉞，錄尚書事。,"Next day Cao Cao came with his great army, and having got them duly camped he went into the city to audience. He knelt at the foot of the steps, but was called up hither to stand beside the Emperor and be thanked.Cao Cao replied, ""Having been the recipient of great bounty, thy servant owes the state much gratitude. The measure of evil of the two rebels is full, but I have two hundred thousand of good soldiers to oppose them, and those soldiers are fully equal to securing the safety of Your Majesty and the Throne. The preservation of the state sacrifice is the matter of real moment.""High honors were conferred on Cao Cao. He was appointed Commander of Capital District, Minister of War, and granted Military Insignia."
卻說李傕，郭汜知操遠來，議欲速戰。賈詡諫曰：「不可。操兵精將勇，不如降之，求免本身之罪。」傕怒曰：「你敢滅吾銳氣！拔劍欲斬詡，眾將勸免。是夜賈詡單馬走回鄉里去了。,"The two rebels, Li Jue and Guo Si, wished to attack Cao Cao's army while fatigued from its long march.But their adviser, Jia Xu, opposed this, saying, ""There was no hope of victory. He has both strong soldiers and brave leaders. Submission may bring us amnesty.""Li Jue was angry at the suggestion, crying, ""Do you wish to dishearten the army?""And he drew his sword on Jia Xu. But the other officers interceded and saved the adviser. That same night Jia Xu stole out of the camp and, quite alone, took his way home to his native village."
次日，李傕軍馬來迎操兵。操先令許褚，曹仁，典韋，領三百鐵騎，於傕陣中衝突三遭，方纔布陣。陣圓處，李傕姪李暹、李別出馬陣前，未及開言，許褚飛馬過去，一刀先斬李暹。李別吃了一驚，倒撞下馬，褚亦斬之，雙挽人頭回陣。曹操撫許褚之背曰：「子真吾之樊噲也！」隨令夏侯惇領兵左出，曹仁領兵右出，操自領中軍衝陣。鼓響一聲，三軍齊進。賊兵抵敵不住，大敗而走。操親掣寶劍押陣，率眾連夜追殺，剿戮極多，降者不計其數。傕、汜望西逃命，忙忙似喪家之狗；自知無處容身，只得往山中落草去了。,"Soon the rebels decided to offer battle. In reply, Cao Cao sent out Xu Chu, Cao Ren, and Dian Wei with three hundred horse. These three leaders dashed into the rebels army but quickly retired. This maneuver was repeated, and again repeated before the real battle array was formed.Then Li Xian and Li Bie, nephews of Li Jue, rode out. At once from Cao Cao's side dashed out Xu Chu and cut down Li Xian. Li Bie was so startled that he fell out of the saddle. He too was slain. The victor Xu Chu rode back to his own side with the two heads.When Xu Chu offered them to the chief, Cao Cao patted him on the back, crying, ""You are really my Fan Kuai!""Next a general move forward was made, Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong leading the two wings and Cao Cao in the center. They advanced to the roll of the drum. The rebels fell back before them and presently fled. They pursued, Cao Cao himself leading, sword in hand. The slaughter went on till night. Ten thousands were killed and many more surrendered. Li Jue and Guo Si went west, flying in panic like dogs from a falling house. Having no place of refuge they took to the hills and hid among the brushwood."
曹操回兵仍屯於洛陽城外。楊奉，韓暹兩個商議：「今曹操成了大功，必拿重權，如何容得我等？」乃入奏天子，只以追殺傕、汜為名，引本部軍屯於大梁去了。,"Cao Cao's army returned and camped again near the capital.Then Yang Feng and Han Xian said one to another, ""This Cao Cao has done a great service, and he will be the man in power. There will be no place for us.""So they represented to the Emperor that they wished to pursue the rebels, and under this excuse withdrew their army and camped at Daliang."
帝一日命人至操營，宣操入宮議事。操聞天使至，請入相見。只見那人眉清目秀，精神充足。操暗想曰：「今東郡大荒，官僚軍民，皆有飢色，此人何得獨肥？」因問之曰：「公尊顏充腴，以何調理而至此？」對曰：「某無他法，只食淡三十年矣。」操乃頷之；又問曰：「君居何職？」對曰：「某舉孝廉。原為袁紹，張揚從事。今聞天子還都，特來朝覲，官封正議郎。濟陰定陶人：姓董，名昭，字公仁。」曹操避席曰：「聞名久矣！幸得於此相見。」遂置酒帳中相待，令與荀彧相會。忽人報曰：「一隊軍往東而去，不知何人。」操急令人探之。董昭曰：「此乃李傕舊將楊奉，與白波帥韓暹，因明公來此，故引兵欲投大梁去耳。」操曰：「莫非疑操乎？」昭曰：「此乃無謀之輩，明公何足慮也？」操又曰：「李、郭二賊此去若何？」昭曰：「虎無爪，鳥無翼，不久當為明公所擒，無足介意。」,"One day the Emperor sent to summon Cao Cao to audience. The messenger was called in. Cao Cao noticed that the messenger looked remarkably well and could not understand it seeing that everyone else looked hungry and famine stricken.So Cao Cao said, ""You look plump and well, Sir, how do you manage it?""""Only this: I have lived meager for thirty years.""Cao Cao nodded, ""What office do you hold?""""I am a graduate recommended for filial piety and honesty. I had offices under Yuan Shao and Zhang Yang, but came here when the Emperor returned. Now I am one of the secretaries. I am a native of Dingtao, and my name is Dong Zhao.""Cao Cao got up from his place and crossed over, saying, ""I have heard of you. How happy I am to meet you!""Then wine was brought into the tent, and Xun Yu was called in and introduced. While they were talking, a man came in to report that a party was moving eastward. Cao Cao ordered to find out whose people these were, but Dong Zhao knew at once.""They are old leaders under the rebels, Yang Feng and the White Wave General Han Xian. They are running off because you have come, Illustrious Sir!""""Do they mistrust me?"" said Cao Cao.""They are not worthy of your attention. They are a poor lot.""""What of this departure of Li Jue and Guo Si?""""Tigers without claws, birds without wings —-they will not escape you very long. They are not worth thinking about."""
操見昭言投機，便問以朝廷大事。昭曰：「明公興義兵以除暴亂，入朝輔佐天子，此五伯之功也。但諸將人殊意異，未必服從。今留此，恐有不便。惟移駕幸許都為上策。然朝廷播越，新還京師，遠近仰望，以冀一朝之安；今復徙駕，不厭眾心。夫行非常之事，乃有非常之功：願將軍決計之。」操執昭手而笑曰：「此吾之本志也。但楊奉布大梁，大臣在朝，不有他變否？」昭曰：「易也以書與楊奉，先安其心；明告大臣，以京師無糧，欲車駕幸許都，近魯陽，轉運糧食，庶無欠缺懸隔之憂。大臣聞之，當欣從也。」操大喜。昭謝別。操執其手曰：「凡操有所圖，惟公教之。」昭稱謝而去。,"Cao Cao saw that he and his guest had much in common, so he began to talk of affairs of state.Said Dong Zhao, ""You, Illustrious Sir, with your noble army have swept away rebellion and have become the mainstay of the Throne, an achievement worthy of the ancient Five Protectors. But the officials will look at it in very different ways and not all favorably to you. I think you would not be wise to remain here, and I advise a change of capital to Xuchang. However, it must be remembered that the restoration of the capital has been published far and wide and the attention of all the people is concentrated on Luoyang, hoping for a period of rest and tranquillity. Another move will displease many. However, the performance of extraordinary deed may mean the acquisition of extraordinary merit. It is for you to decide.""""Exactly my own inclination!"" said Cao Cao, seizing his guest's hand. ""But are there not dangers? Yang Feng at Daliang and the court officials!""""That is easily managed. Write to Yang Feng and set his mind at rest. Then say to the high officials plainly that there is no food in the capital here, and so you are going to another place where there is, and where there is no danger of scarcity. When they hear it, they will approve.""Cao Cao had now decided; and as his guest took leave, Cao Cao seized his hands once more, saying, ""I shall need your advice in future affairs."" Dong Zhao thanked and left."
操由是日與眾謀士密議遷都之事。時侍中太史令王立私謂宗正劉艾曰：「吾仰觀天文，自去春太白犯鎮星於斗牛，過天津，熒惑又逆行，與太白會於天關，金火交會，必有新天子出。吾觀大漢氣數將終，晉、魏之地，必有興者。」又密奏獻帝曰：「天命有去就，五行不常盛。代火者土也。代漢而有天下者，當在魏。」操聞之，使告立曰：「知公忠於朝廷，然天道深遠，幸勿多言。」操以是告彧。彧曰：「漢以火德王，而明公乃土命也。許都屬土，到彼必興。火能生土，土能旺木：正合董昭、王立之言。他日必有興者。」操意遂決。次日，入見帝，奏曰：「東都荒廢久矣，不可修葺；更兼轉運糧食艱辛。許都地近魯陽，城宮宮室，錢糧民物，足可備用。臣敢請駕幸許都：惟陛下從之。」帝不敢不從；群臣皆懼操勢，亦莫敢有異議；遂擇日起駕。操引軍護行，百官皆從。行不到數程，前至一高陵。忽然喊聲大舉，楊奉，韓暹，領兵攔路。徐晃當先，大叫：「曹操欲劫駕何往！」,"Thereafter Cao Cao and his advisers secretly discussed the change of capital. Now Court Counselor Wang Li, who was an astrologer, said to Liu Cai, Royal Clan Recorder, ""I have been studying the stars. Since last spring Venus has been nearing the Guard star in the neighborhood of the Measure, and the Cowherd (the Great Bear and Vega) crossing the River of Heaven. Mars has been retrograding and came into conjunction with Venus in the Gate of Heaven, so that metal (Venus) and fire (Mars) are mingled. Thence must emerge a new ruler. The aura of the Hans is exhausted, and the ancient states of Jin and Wei must increase.""A secret memorial was presented to the Emperor, saying:""The Mandate of Heaven has its course, and the five elements —-metal, wood, water, fire, and earth —-are out of proportion. Earth attacking fire is Wei attacking Han, and the successor to the empire of Han is in Wei.""Cao Cao heard of these sayings and memorials and sent a man to the astrologer to say, ""Your loyalty is well known, but the ways of Heaven are past finding out. The less said the better.""Then Cao Cao discussed with Xun Yu.The adviser expounded the meaning thus: ""The virtue of Han was fire; your element is earth. Xuchang is under the influence of earth, and so your fortune depends on getting there. Fire can overcome earth, as earth can multiply wood. Dong Zhao and Wang Li agree, and you have only to hide your time.""So Cao Cao made up his mind.Next day at court he said, ""Luoyang is deserted and cannot be restored, nor can it be supplied easily with food. Xuchang is a noble city, resourceful and close to Luyang, which is a grain basin. It is everything that a capital should be. I venture to request that the court move thither.""The Emperor dared not oppose and the officials were too overawed to have any independent opinion, so they chose a day to set out. Cao Cao commanded the escort, and the officials all followed. When they had traveled a few stages, they saw before them a high mound and from behind this there arose the beating of drums.Then Yang Feng and Han Xian came out and barred the way. In front of all stood Xu Huang, who shouted, ""Cao Cao is stealing away the Emperor!"""
操出馬視之，見徐晃威風凜凜，暗暗稱奇；便令許褚出馬與徐晃交鋒。刀斧相交，戰五十餘合，不分勝敗。操即鳴金收軍，召謀士議曰：「楊奉，韓暹誠不足道；徐晃乃真良將也。吾不忍以力併之，當以計招之。」行軍從事滿寵曰：「主公勿慮：某向與徐晃有一面之交，今晚扮作小卒，偷入其營，以言說之，管教他傾心來降。」操欣然遣之。,"Cao Cao rode out and took a good look at this man. He seemed a fine fellow; and in his secret soul Cao Cao greatly admired him, although he was an enemy. Then Cao Cao ordered Xu Chu to go and fight Xu Huang. The combat was battle-ax against broadsword, and the two men fought more than half a hundred bouts without advantage to either side. Cao Cao then beat the gongs and drew off his troops.In the camp a council was called. Cao Cao said, ""The two rebels themselves need not be discussed; but Xu Huang is a fine general, and I was unwilling to use any great force against him. I want to win him over to our side.""Then stepped out Man Chong, replying, ""Do not let that trouble you. I will have a word with him. I shall disguise myself as a soldier this evening and steal over to the enemy's camp to talk to him. I shall incline his heart toward you."""
是夜滿寵扮作小卒，混入彼軍隊中，偷至徐晃帳前，只見晃秉燭被甲而坐。寵突至其前，揖曰：「故人別來無恙乎！」徐晃驚起，熟視之曰：「子非山陽滿伯寧耶！何以至此？」寵曰：「某現為曹將軍從事。今日於陣前得見故人，欲進一言，故特冒死而來。」晃乃延之坐，問其來意。寵曰：「公之勇略，世所罕有，奈何屈身於楊、韓之徒？曹將軍當世英雄，其好賢禮士，天下所知也；今日陣前，見公之勇，十分敬愛，故不忍以健將決死戰，特遣寵來奉邀。公何不棄暗投明，共成大業？」,"That night Man Chong, duly disguised, got over to the other side and made his way to the tent of Xu Huang, who sat there by the light of a candle. Xu Huang was still wearing his coat of mail.Suddenly Man Chong ran out in front and saluted, saying, ""You have been well since we parted, old friend?""Xu Huang jumped up in surprise, gazed into the face of the speaker a long time, and presently said, ""What! You are Man Chong of Shanyang? What are you doing here?""""I am an officer in General Cao Cao's army. Seeing my old friend out in front of the army today, I wanted to say a word to him. So I took the risk of stealing in this evening, and here I am.""Xu Huang invited Man Chong in, and they sat down.Then said Man Chong, ""There are very few as bold as you on earth. Why then do you serve such as your present chiefs, Yang Feng and Han Xian? My master is the most prominent man in the world —-a man who delights in wise people and appreciates soldiers as everyone knows. Your valor today won his entire admiration, and so he took care that the attack was not vigorous enough to sacrifice you. Now he has sent me to invite you to join him. Will you not leave darkness for light and help him in his magnificent task?"""
晃沈吟良久，乃喟然歎曰：「吾固知奉、暹非立業之人，奈從之久矣，不忍相捨。」寵曰：「豈不聞『良禽擇木而棲，賢臣擇主而事』？遇可事之主，而交臂失之，非丈夫也。」晃起謝曰：「願從公言。」寵曰：「何不就殺奉、暹而去，以為進見之禮？」晃曰：「以臣弒主，大不義也，吾決不為。」寵曰：「公真義士也！」晃遂引帳下數十騎，連夜同滿寵來投曹操。早有人報知楊奉。奉大怒，自引千騎來追，大叫：「徐晃反賊休走！」,"Xu Huang sat a long time pondering over the offer. Then he said, with a sigh, ""I know my masters are doomed to failure, but I have followed their fortunes a long time and do not like to leave them.""""But you know the prudent bird selects its tree, and the wise servant chooses his master. When one meets a worthy master and lets him go, one is very reckless.""""I am willing to do what you say,"" said Xu Huang, rising.""Why not put these two to death as an introductory gift?"" said Man Chong.""It is very wrong for a servant to slay his master. I will not do that.""""True. You are really a good man.""Then Xu Huang, taking only a few horsemen of his own men with him, left that night and deserted to Cao Cao. Soon someone took the news to Yang Feng, who at the head of a thousand strong horsemen, set out to capture the deserter.As they drew close, Yang Feng called out, ""Betrayer! Stop there!"""
正追趕間，忽然一聲砲響，山上山下，火把齊明，伏軍四出。曹操親自引軍當先，大喝：「我在此等候多時，休教走脫！」楊奉大驚，急待回軍，早被曹兵圍住。恰好韓暹引兵來救，兩軍混戰，楊奉走脫。曹操趁彼軍亂，乘勢攻擊，兩家軍士大半多降。楊奉、韓暹勢孤，引敗兵投袁術去了。,"But Yang Feng fell into an ambush. Suddenly the whole mountain side was lit up with torches and out sprang Cao Cao's troops, he himself being in command.""I have been waiting here a long time. Do not run away!"" cried Cao Cao.Yang Feng was completely surprised and tried to draw off, but was quickly surrounded. Then Han Xian came to his rescue, and a confused battle began. Yang Feng succeeded in escaping, while Cao Cao kept up the attack on the two disordered armies. A great number of the rebels gave in, and the leaders found they had too few men left to maintain their independence, so they betook themselves to Yuan Shu."
曹操收軍回營，滿寵引徐晃入見。操大喜，厚待之。於是迎鑾駕到許都，蓋造宮室殿宇，立宗廟社稷、省臺司院衙門，修城郭府庫；封董承等十三人為列侯。賞功罰罪，並聽曹操處置。,"When Cao Cao returned to camp, the newly surrendered general was presented and well received. Then again the cavalcade set out for the new capital. In due time they reached Xuchang, and they built palaces and halls, an ancestral temple and an altar, terraces and public offices. The walls were repaired, storehouses built and all put in order.Then came the rewards for Cao Cao's adherents and others. Dong Cheng and thirteen others were raised to rank of lordship. All good service was rewarded; certain others again, who deserved it, were punished, all according to Cao Cao's sole decision."
操自封為大將軍武平侯，以荀彧為侍中尚書令；荀攸為軍師；郭嘉為司馬祭酒；劉曄為司空掾曹；毛玠，任峻為典農中郎將，催督錢糧；程昱為東平相，范成，董昭為洛陽令；滿寵為許都令；夏侯惇，夏侯淵，曹仁，曹洪皆為將軍；呂虔，李典，樂進，于禁，徐晃，皆為校尉；許褚，典韋，皆為都尉；其餘將士，各各封官。自此大權皆歸於曹操。朝廷大務，先稟曹操，然後方奏天子。,"Cao Cao made himself Prime Minister, Regent Marshal, and Lord of Wuping. Xun Yu was made Imperial Counselor and Chair of the Secretariat; Xun You, Minister of War; Guo Jia, Minister of Rites and Religion; Liu Ye, Minister of Works; Mao Jie, Minister of Agriculture, and together with Ren Jun, they were put over the supervision of military farms and stores. Cheng Yu was appointed Lord of Dongping; Dong Zhao, Magistrate of Luoyang; Man Chong, Magistrate of Xuchang. Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Cao Ren, Cao Hong, Lu Qian, Li Dian, Yue Jing, Yu Jin, and Xu Huang were made Commanders; Xu Chu and Dian Wei, Commanders of Capital District. All good service received full recognition.Cao Cao was then the one man of the court. All memorials went first to him and were then submitted to the Throne."
操既定大事，乃設宴後堂，聚眾謀士共議曰：「劉備屯兵徐州，自領州事；近呂布以兵敗投之，備使居於小沛，若二人同心引兵來犯，乃心腹之患也。公等有何妙計可圖之？」許褚曰：「願借精兵五萬，斬劉備、呂布之頭，獻於丞相。」荀彧曰：「將軍勇則勇矣，不知用謀。今許都新定，未可造次用兵。彧有一計，名曰：『二虎競食之計』。今劉備雖領徐州，未得詔命。明公可奏請詔命實授備為徐州牧，因密與一書，教殺呂布。事成則備無猛士為輔，亦漸可圖；事不成，則呂布必殺備矣；此乃『二虎競食之計』也。」操從其言，即時奏請詔命，遣使齎往徐州，封劉備為征東將軍宜城亭侯，領徐州牧；並附密書一封。,"When state matters were in order, Cao Cao gave a great banquet in his private quarters to all his advisers, and affairs outside the capital were the subject of discussion.Then Cao Cao said, ""Liu Bei has his army at Xuzhou, and he carries on the administration of the region. Lu Bu fled to Liu Bei when defeated, and Liu Bei gave Lu Bu Xiaopei to live in. If these two agreed to join forces and attack, my position would be most serious. What precautions can be taken?""Then rose Xu Chu, saying, ""Give me fifty thousand of picked soldiers, and I will give the Prime Minister both their heads!""Xun Yu said, ""O Leader, you are brave, but we must consider the present circumstance. We cannot start a sudden war just as the capital has been changed. However, there is a certain ruse known as 'Rival Tigers and One Prey'. Liu Bei has no decree authorizing him to govern the region. You, Sir Prime Minister, can procure one for him, and when sending it, and so conferring upon him the right in addition to his might, you can enclose a private note telling him to get rid of Lu Bu. If he does, then he will have lost a vigorous warrior from his side, and he could be dealt with as occasions serve. Should he fail, then Lu Bu will slay him. This is the 'Rival Tigers and One Prey' ruse: They wrangle and bite each other.""Cao Cao agreed that this was a good plan, so he memorialized for the formal appointment, which he sent to Liu Bei. Liu Bei was created General Who Conquers the East, Lord of Yicheng, and Imperial Protector of Xuzhou as well. At the same time a private note was enclosed."
卻說劉玄德在徐州，聞帝幸許都，正欲上表慶賀。忽報天使至，出郭迎接入郡，拜受恩命畢，設宴管待來使。使曰：「君侯得此恩命，實曹將軍於帝前保薦之力也。」玄德稱謝。使者乃取出私書遞與玄德。玄德看罷，曰：「此事尚容計議。」席散，安歇來使於館驛。玄德夜與眾商議此事。張飛曰：「呂布本無義之人，殺之何礙？」玄德曰：「他勢窮而來投我，我若殺之，亦是不義。」張飛曰：「好人難做！」玄德不從。,"In Xuzhou, when Liu Bei heard of the change of capital, he began to prepare a congratulatory address. In the midst of this an imperial messenger was announced and was met which all ceremony outside the gate. When the epistle had been reverently received, a banquet was prepared for the messenger.The messenger said, ""This decree was obtained for you by Prime Minister Cao Cao.""Liu Bei thanked him. Then the messenger drew forth his secret letter.After reading it, Liu Bei said, ""This matter can be easily arranged.""The banquet over and the messenger conducted to his lodging to seek repose. Liu Bei, before going to rest, called in his councilors to consider the letter.""There need be no compunction about putting him to death,"" said Zhang Fei. ""Lu Bu is a bad man.""""But he came to me for protection in his weakness: How can I put him to death? That would be immoral,"" said Liu Bei.""If he was a good man, it would be difficult,"" replied Zhang Fei. Liu Bei would not consent."
次日，呂布來賀，玄德教請入見。布曰：「聞公受朝廷恩命，特來相賀。」玄德遜謝。只見張飛扯劍上廳，要殺呂布，玄德慌忙阻住。布大驚曰：「翼德何故只要殺我？」張飛叫曰：「曹操道你是無義之人，教我哥哥殺你！」玄德連聲喝退。乃引呂布同入後堂，實告前因；就將曹操所送密書與呂布看。布看畢，泣曰：「此乃曹賊欲令二人不和耳！」玄德曰：「兄勿憂：劉備誓不為此不義之事。」,"Next day, when Lu Bu came to offer congratulations, he was received as usual. He said, ""I have come to felicitate you on the receipt of the imperial bounty.""Liu Bei thanked him in due form. But then he saw Zhang Fei draw his sword and come up the hall as if to slay Lu Bu. Liu Bei hastily interfered and stopped Zhang Fei.Lu Bu was surprised and said, ""Why do you wish to slay me, Zhang Fei?""""Cao Cao says you are immoral and tells my brother to kill you,"" shouted Zhang Fei.Liu Bei shouted again and again to Zhang Fei to go away, and he led Lu Bu into the private apartments out of the way. Then he told Lu Bu the whole story and showed him the secret letter.Lu Bu wept as he finished reading, ""This is that miscreant's scheme for sowing discord between us.""""Be not anxious, elder brother,"" said Liu Bei. ""I pledge myself not to be guilty of such an infamous crime."""
呂布再三拜謝。備留布飲酒，至晚方回。關、張曰：「兄長何故不殺呂布？」玄德曰：「此曹孟德恐我與呂布同謀伐之，故用此計，使我兩人自相吞併，彼卻於中取利。奈何為所使乎？」關公點頭道是。張飛曰：「我只要殺此賊以絕後患！」玄德曰：「此非大丈夫之所為也。」,"Lu Bu again and again expressed his gratitude, and Liu Bei kept him for a time. They remained talking and drinking wine till late.Asked Guan Yu and Zhang Fei later, ""Why not kill him?""Liu Bei said, ""Because Cao Cao fears that Lu Bu and I may attack him, he is trying to separate us and get us to swallow each other, while he steps in and takes the advantage. Is there any other reason?""Guan Yu nodded assent, but Zhang Fei said, ""I want to get him out of the way, lest he would trouble us later.""""That is not what a noble man should do,"" said his elder brother."
次日，玄德送使命回京，就拜表謝恩，並回書與曹操，只言容緩圖之。使命回見曹操，言玄德不殺呂布之事。操問彧曰：「此計不成，奈何？」彧曰：「又有一計，名曰『驅虎吞狼之計』。」操曰：「其計如何？」彧曰：「可暗令人往袁術處通問，報說劉備上密表，要略南郡。術聞之，必怒而攻備，公乃明詔劉備討袁術。兩邊相併，呂布必生異心：此『驅虎吞狼之計』也。」操大喜，先發人往袁術處；次假天子詔，發人往徐州。,"Soon the messenger was dismissed and returned to the capital with a the reply from Liu Bei. The letter only said the instruction would take time to plan and implement. But the messenger, when he saw Cao Cao, told him the story of Liu Bei's pledge to Lu Bu.Then said Cao Cao, ""The plan has failed. What next?""Xun Yu replied, ""I have another trick called 'Tiger against Wolf' in which the tiger is made to gobble up the wolf.""""Let us hear it,"" said Cao Cao.""Send to Yuan Shu to say that Liu Bei has sent up a secret memorial to the Throne that he wishes to subdue the southern regions around the Huai River. Yuan Shu will be angry and attack him. Then you will order Liu Bei to dispose of Yuan Shu and so set them destroying each other. Lu Bu will certainly think that is his chance and turn traitor. This is the 'Tiger against Wolf' trick.""Cao Cao thought this good and sent the messenger and also sent a false edict to Liu Bei."
卻說玄德在徐州，聞使命至，出郭迎接；開讀詔書，卻是要起兵討袁術。玄德領命，送使者先回。糜竺曰：「此又是曹操之計。」玄德曰：「雖是計，王命不可違也。」,"When this came, the messenger was received with all the ceremonies, and the edict ordered the capture of Yuan Shu. After the departure of the bearer, Liu Bei called Mi Zhu who pronounced it a ruse.""It may be,"" said Liu Bei, ""but the royal command is not to be disobeyed."""
遂點軍馬，剋日起程。孫乾曰：「可先定守城之人。」玄德曰：「二弟之中，誰人可守？」關公曰：「弟願守此城。」玄德曰：「吾早晚欲與爾議事，豈可相離？」張飛曰：「小弟願守此城。」玄德曰：「你守不得此城。你一者酒後剛強，鞭打士卒；二者作事輕易，不從人諫。吾不於心。」,"So the army was prepared and the day fixed.Sun Qian said, ""A trusty man must be left on guard of the city.""And Liu Bei asked which of his brothers would undertake this task.""I will guard the city,"" said Guan Yu.""I am constantly in need of your advice, so how can we part?"" said Liu Bei.""I will guard the city,"" said Zhang Fei.""You will fail,"" said Liu Bei. ""After one of your drinking bouts, you will get savage and flog the soldiers. Beside you are rash and will not listen to anyone's advice. I shall be uneasy all the time."""
張飛曰：「弟自今以後，不飲酒，不打軍士，諸般聽人勸諫便了。」糜竺曰：「只恐口不應心。」飛怒曰：「吾跟哥哥多年，未嘗失信，你如何輕料我！」玄德曰：「弟言雖如此，吾終不放心。還請陳元龍輔之。早晚令其少飲酒，勿致失事。」陳登應諾。玄德吩咐了當，乃統馬步軍三萬，離徐州望南陽進發。,"""Henceforth I will drink no more wine, I will not beat the soldiers, and I will always listen to advice,"" said Zhang Fei.""I fear the mouth does not correspond to the heart,"" said Mi Zhu.""I have followed my elder brother these many years and never broken faith. Why should you be contemptuous?"" said Zhang Fei.Liu Bei said, ""Though you say this, I do not feel quite satisfied. I will order Adviser Chen Deng to help you and keep you sober. Then you will not make any mistake.""Chen Deng was willing to undertake this duty, and the final orders were given. The army of thirty thousand, horse and foot, left Xuzhou and marched toward Nanyang."
卻說袁術聞說劉備上表，欲吞其州縣，乃大怒曰：「汝乃織蓆編屨之夫，今輒占據大郡，與諸侯同列；吾正欲伐汝，汝卻反欲圖我！深為可恨！」乃使上將紀靈起兵十萬，殺奔徐州。兩軍會於盱眙。玄德兵少，依山傍水下寨。,"When Yuan Shu heard that a memorial had been presented proposing to take possession of his territories, he broke out into abuse of Liu Bei.""You weaver of mats! You plaiter of straw shoes! You have been smart enough to get possession of a large region and elbow your way into the ranks of the nobles. I was just going to attack you, and now you dare to scheme against me! How I detest you!""So Yuan Shu at once gave orders to prepare an army of one hundred thousand, under Ji Ling, to attack Xuzhou. The two armies met at Xuyi, where Liu Bei was encamped in a plain with hills behind and a stream on his flank, for his army was small."
那紀靈乃山東人，使一口三尖刀，重五十斤。是日引兵出，大罵：「劉備村夫，安敢侵吾境界！」玄德曰：「吾奉天子詔，以討不臣。汝今敢來相拒，罪不容誅！」紀靈大怒，拍馬舞刀，直取玄德。關公大喝曰：「匹夫休得逞強！」出馬與紀靈大戰。一連三十合，不分勝負。紀靈大叫少歇，關公便撥馬回陣，立於陣前候之。紀靈卻遣副將荀正出馬。關公曰：「只教紀靈來，與他決個雌雄！」荀正曰：「汝乃無名下將，非紀將軍對手！」關公大怒，直取荀正；交馬一合，砍荀正於馬下。玄德驅兵殺將過去，紀靈大敗退守淮陰河口，不敢交戰；只教軍士來偷營劫寨，皆被徐州兵殺敗。兩軍相拒，不在話下。,"Ji Ling was a native of the East of Huashan Mountains. He used a very heavy three-edged sword.After he had made his camp, he rode out and began abusing his opponents, shouting, ""Liu Bei, you rustic bumpkin, how dare you invade this land?""""I have a decree ordering me to destroy the Governor who behaves improperly. If you oppose, you will be assuredly punished,"" replied Liu Bei.Ji Ling angrily rode out brandishing his weapon.But Guan Yu cried, ""Fool, do not attempt to fight!""And Guan Yu rode out to meet him. Then they two fought and after thirty bouts neither had an advantage. Then Ji Ling cried out for a rest. So Guan Yu turned his horse away, rode back to his own array and waited for Ji Ling.When the moment came to renew the combat, Ji Ling sent out one of his officers, Xun Zheng, to take his place.But Guan Yu said, ""Tell Ji Ling to come. I must settle with him who shall be tiger and who shall be deer!""""You —-a reputationless leader and unworthy to fight with our general!"" replied Xun Zheng.This reply angered Guan Yu, who made just one attack on Xun Zheng and brought him to the ground. At this success Liu Bei urged on the army, and Ji Ling's troops were defeated.They retired to the mouth of River Huaiyin and declined all challenges. However, many of their troops were sent into Liu Bei's camp for harassment, and many of them were slain. The two armies thus stood facing each other."
卻說張飛自送玄德起身後，一應雜事，俱付陳元龍管理；軍機大務，自家斟酌。一日，設宴請各官赴席。眾人坐定，張飛開言曰：「我兄臨去時，吩咐我少飲酒，恐致失事。眾官今日盡此一醉，明日都各戒酒，幫我守城。今日卻都要滿飲。」言罷，起身與眾官把盞。酒至曹豹面前，豹曰：「我從天戒，不飲酒。」飛曰：「廝殺漢如何不飲酒？我要你吃一盞。」豹懼怕，只得飲了一盃。,"In Xuzhou, after Liu Bei had started on his expedition, Zhang Fei placed his colleague and helper, Chen Deng, in charge of the administration of the region, keeping military affairs under his own supervision. After thinking over the matter or some time, he gave a banquet to all the military officers.When they were all seated, he made a speech: ""Before my brother left, he bade me keep clear of the wine cup for fear of accidents. Now, gentlemen, you may drink deep today. But from tomorrow wine is forbidden, for we must keep the city safe. So take your fill.""And with this he and all his guests rose to drink together.The wine bearer came to Cao Bao who declined it, saying, ""I never drink as I am forbidden by religion.""""What! A fighting man does not drink wine!"" said the host. ""I want you to take just one cup.""Cao Bao was afraid to offend, so he drank."
張飛把遍各官，自斟巨觥，連飲了幾十盃，不覺大醉，卻又起身與眾官把盞。酒至曹豹，豹曰：「某實不能飲矣。」飛曰：「你恰纔吃了，如今為何推卻？」豹再三不飲，飛醉後使酒，便發怒曰：「你違我將令，該打一百！」便喝軍士拏下。陳元龍曰：「玄德公臨去時，吩咐你甚來？」飛曰：「你文官，只管文官事，休來管我！」,"Now Zhang Fei drank huge goblets with all his guests on every hand and so swallowed a huge quantity of liquor. He became quite intoxicated. Yet he would drink more and insisted on a cup with every guest. It came to the turn of Cao Bao who declined.""Really, I cannot drink,"" said Cao Bao.""You drank just now: Why refuse this time?""Zhang Fei pressed him, but still Cao Bao resisted.Then Zhang Fei in his drunken madness lost control of his temper and said, ""If you disobey the orders of your general, you shall be beaten one hundred strokes!""And he called in his guards.Here Chen Deng interfered, saying, ""Do you remember the strict injunctions of your brother before he left?""""You civilians attend to your civil business and leave us alone,"" said Zhang Fei."
曹豹無奈，只得告求曰：「翼德公，看我女伍婿之面，且恕我罷。」飛曰：「你女婿是誰？」豹曰：「呂布是也。」飛大怒曰：「我本不欲打你；你把呂布來嚇我，我偏要打你！我打你，便是打呂布！」諸人勸不住。將曹豹鞭至五十，眾人苦苦告饒，方止。,"The only way of escape for Cao Bao was to beg remission, and he did so, saying, ""Sir, if you saw my son-in-law's face, you would pardon me.""""Who is your son-in-law?""""Lu Bu.""""I did not mean to have you really beaten; but if you think to frighten me with Lu Bu, I will! I will beat you as if I were beating him!"" said Zhang Fei.The guests interposed to beg him off, but their drunken host was obdurate, and the unhappy guest received fifty blows. Then at the earnest prayers of the others the remainder of the punishment was remitted."
席散，曹豹回去，深恨張飛，連夜差人齎書一封，逕投小沛見呂布，備說張飛無禮；且云：玄德已往淮南，今夜可乘飛醉，引兵來襲徐州，不可錯此機會。呂布見書，便請陳宮來議。宮曰：「小沛原非久居之地。今徐州既有可乘之隙，失此不取，悔之晚矣。」,"The banquet came to an end, and the beaten Cao Bao went away burning with resentment. That night he sent a letter to Xiaopei relating the insults he had received from Zhang Fei. The letter told Lu Bu of Liu Bei's absence and proposed that a sudden raid should be made that very night before Zhang Fei had recovered from his drunken fit. Lu Bu at once summoned Chen Gong and told him.""Xiaopei is only a place to occupy temporarily,"" said Chen Gong. ""If you can seize Xuzhou, do so. It is a good chance."""
布從之，隨即披挂上馬，領五百騎先行；使陳宮引大軍繼進，高順亦隨後進發。小沛離徐州只四五十里，上馬便到。呂布到城下時，恰纔四更，月色澄清，城上更不知覺。布到城門邊叫曰：「劉使君有機密使人至。」城上有曹豹軍報知曹豹，豹上城看之，便令軍士開門。呂布一聲暗號，眾軍齊入，喊聲大舉。,"Lu Bu got ready at once and soon on the way with five hundred cavalrymen, ordering Chen Gong and Gao Shun to follow him with the main body.Xiaopei being only about fifteen miles away, Lu Bu was under the walls at the fourth watch. It was clear moonlight. No one on the ramparts saw him.Lu Bu came up close to the wall and called out, ""Liu Bei's secret messenger has arrived!""The guards on the wall were Cao Bao's people, and they called him. Cao Bao came, and when he saw who was there, he ordered the gates to be opened. Lu Bu gave the secret signal, and the soldiers entered shouting."
張飛正醉臥府中，左右急忙搖醒，報說：「呂布賺開城門，殺將進來了！」張飛大怒，慌忙披挂，綽了丈八蛇矛；纔出府門，上得馬時，呂布軍馬已到，正與相迎。張飛此時酒猶未醒，不能力戰。呂布素知飛勇，亦不敢相逼。十八騎燕將，保著張飛，殺出東門，玄德家眷在府中，都不及顧了。,"Zhang Fei was in his apartment sleeping off the fumes of wine. His servants hastened to arouse him and told him an enemy had got the gates open.They said, ""Lu Bu got in, and there is fighting in the city!""Zhang Fei savagely got into his armor and laid hold of his mighty serpent halberd. But as he was mounting his horse at the gate, the attacking soldiers came up. He rushed at them but being still half intoxicated made but a poor fight. Lu Bu knowing Zhang Fei's prowess did not press him hard, and Zhang Fei made his way, with eighteen leading guards of Yan, to the east gate, and there went out, leaving Liu Bei's family to their fate."
卻說曹豹見張飛只十數護從，又欺他醉，遂引百十人趕來。飛見豹，大怒，拍馬來迎。戰了三合，曹豹敗走，飛趕到河邊，一鎗正刺中曹豹後心，連人帶馬，死於河中。飛於城外招呼士卒，出城者盡隨飛投淮南而去。呂布入城安撫居民，令軍士一百人守把玄德宅門，諸人不許擅入。,"Cao Bao, seeing Zhang Fei had but a very small force and was still half drunk as well, came in pursuit. Zhang Fei saw who it was and was mad with rage. He galloped toward Cao Bao and drove him off after a few passes. He followed Cao Bao to the moat and wounded him in the back. Cao Bao's frightened steed carried its master into the moat, and he was drowned.Once well outside the city Zhang Fei collected his troops, and they rode off toward the south direction.Lu Bu having surprised the city set himself to restore order. He put guards over the residence of Liu Bei so that no one should disturb the family."
卻說張飛引數十騎，直到盱眙見玄德，具說曹豹與呂布裏應外合，夜襲徐州。眾皆失色。玄德歎曰：「得何足喜，失何足憂！」關公曰：「嫂嫂安在？」飛曰：「皆陷於城中矣。」玄德默然無語。關公頓足埋怨曰：「你當初要守城時，說甚來？兄長吩咐你甚來？今日城池又失了，嫂嫂又陷了，如何是好！」張飛聞言，惶恐無地，掣劍欲自刎。正是：,"Zhang Fei with his few followers went to his brother's camp at Xuyi and told his story of treachery and surprise. All were greatly distressed.""Success is not worth rejoicing; failure is not worth grieving,"" said Liu Bei with a sigh.""Where are our sisters?"" asked Guan Yu.""They shared the fate of the city.""Liu Bei nodded his head and was silent.Guan Yu with an effort controlled his reproaches and said, ""What did you say when you promised to guard the city, and what orders did our brother give you? Now the city is lost and therewith our sisters-in-law. Have you done well?""Zhang Fei was overwhelmed by remorse. He drew his sword to kill himself."
舉杯暢飲情何放？拔劍捐生悔已遲！不知性命如何，且聽下文分解。,"He raised the cup in pledge,None might say nay;Remorseful, drew the sword,Himself to slay.Zhang Fei's fate will be told in the next chapter."
