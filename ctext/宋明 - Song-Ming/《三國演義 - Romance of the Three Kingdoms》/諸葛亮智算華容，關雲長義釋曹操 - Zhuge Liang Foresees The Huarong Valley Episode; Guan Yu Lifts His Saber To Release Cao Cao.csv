卻說當夜張遼一箭射黃蓋下水，救得曹操登岸，尋著馬匹走時，軍已大亂。韓當冒煙突火來攻水寨，忽聽得士卒報道：「後梢舵上一人，高叫將軍表字。」韓當細聽，但聞高叫：「公義救我！」當曰：「此黃公覆也！」急教救起。見黃蓋負箭著傷，咬出箭桿，箭頭陷在肉內。韓當急為脫去濕衣，用刀剜出箭頭，扯旗束之，脫自己戰袍與黃蓋穿了，先令別船送回大寨醫治。原來黃蓋深知水性，故大寒之時，和甲墮江，也逃得性命。,"The last chapter closed with Huang Gai in the water wounded, Cao Cao rescued from immediate danger, and confusion rampant among the soldiers. Pressing forward to attack the naval camp, Han Dang was told by his soldiers that someone was clinging to the rudder of his boat and shouting to him by his familiar name. Han Dang listened carefully and in the voice at once he recognized that Huang Gai was calling to him for help.""That is my friend Huang Gai!"" cried he, and they quickly pulled the wounded leader out of the water.Then they saw Huang Gai was wounded for the arrow still stuck. Han Dang bit out the shaft of the arrow but the point was deeply buried in the flesh. They hastily pulled off his wet garments and cut out the metal arrowhead with a dagger, tore up one of the flags, and bound up the wound. Then Han Dang gave Huang Gai his own fighting robe to put on and sent him off in a small boat back to camp.Huang Gai's escape from drowning must be taken as proof of his natural affinity for, or sympathy with, water. Although it was the period of great cold and he was heavy with armor when he fell into the river, yet he escaped with life."
卻說當日滿江火滾，喊聲震地。左邊是韓當，蔣欽，兩軍從赤壁西邊殺來；右邊是周泰，陳武，兩軍從赤壁東邊殺來；正中是周瑜，程普，徐盛，丁奉，大隊船隻都到，火須兵應，兵仗火威。此正是：三江水戰，赤壁鏖兵。曹軍著槍中箭，火焚水溺者，不計其數。後人有詩曰：魏吳爭鬥決雌雄，赤壁樓船一掃空。烈火初張照雲海，周郎曾此破曹公。,"In this great battle at the junction of the three rivers, the Three Gorges, when fire seemed to spread wide over all the wide surface of the water, when the earth quaked with the roar of battle, when land forces closed in on both wings and four battle squadrons advanced on the front, when the ferocity of fire answered the clash of weapons and weapons were aided by fire, under the thrusts of spears and the flights of arrows, burnt by fire and drowned by water, Cao Cao lost an incalculable number of troops. And a poet wrote:When Wei and Wu together stroveFor the mastery,In the Red Cliffs fight the tall shipsVanished from the sea,For there the fierce flames, leaping high.Burned them utterly.So Zhou Yu for his liege lordGot the victory."
又有一絕云：山高月小水茫茫，追歎前朝割據忙。南士無心迎魏武，東風有意便周郎。,"And another poem runs:The hills are high, the moon shines faint.The waters stretch afar;I sigh to think how oft this landHas suffered stress of war;And I recall how southernersShrank from the northern army's might,And how a favoring eastern galeHelped them to win the fight."
不說江中鏖兵。且說甘寧令蔡中引入曹寨深處，寧將蔡中一刀砍於馬下，就草上放起火來。呂蒙遙望中軍火起，也放十數處火，接應甘寧。潘璋，董襲，分頭放火吶喊。四下裏鼓聲大震。曹操與張遼引百餘騎，在火林內走，看前面無一處不著。正走之間，毛玠救得文聘，引十數騎到。操令軍尋路。張遼指道：「只有烏林，地面空闊，可走。」操逕奔烏林。,"While fire was consuming the naval base of Cao Cao, Gan Ning made Cai Zhong guide him into the innermost recesses of Cao Cao's camp. Then Gan Ning slew Cai Zhong with one slash of his sword. After this Gan Ning set fire to the jungle; and at this signal, Lu Meng put fire to the grass in ten places near to each other. Then other fires were started, and the noise of battle was on all sides.Cao Cao and Zhang Liao, with a small party of horsemen, fled through the burning forest. They could see no road in front; all seemed on fire. Presently Mao Jie and Wen Ping, with a few more horsemen, joined them. Cao Cao bade the soldiers seek a way through.Zhang Liao pointed out, saying, ""The only suitable road is through the Black Forest.""And they took it."
正走間，背後一軍趕到，大叫：「曹賊休走！」火光中現出呂蒙旗號。操催軍馬向前，留張遼斷後，抵敵呂蒙。卻見前面火把又起，從山谷中擁出一軍，大叫：「凌統在此！」曹操肝膽皆裂。忽刺斜裏一彪軍到，大叫：「丞相休慌！徐晃在此！」彼此混戰一場，路望北而走。忽見一隊軍馬，屯在山坡前。徐晃出問，乃是袁紹手下降將馬延，張顗，有三千北地軍馬，列寨在彼；當夜見滿天火起，未敢轉動，恰好接著曹操。操教二將引一千軍馬開路，其餘留著護身。操得這枝生力軍馬，心中稍安。馬延，張顗二將，飛騎前行。不到十里，喊聲起處，一彪軍出。為首一將，大呼曰：「吾乃東吳，甘興霸也！」馬延正欲交鋒，早被甘寧一刀斬於馬下。張顗挺槍來迎，寧大喝一聲，顗措手不及，被寧手起一刀，翻身落馬。後軍飛報曹操。,"They had gone but a short distance when they were overtaken by a small party of the enemy, and a voice cried, ""Cao Cao, stop!""It was Lu Meng, whose ensign soon appeared against the fiery background. Cao Cao urged his small party of fugitives forward, bidding Zhang Liao defend him from Lu Meng.Soon after Cao Cao saw the light of torches in front, and from a gorge there rushed out another force. And the leader cried, ""Ling Tong is here!""Cao Cao was scared. His liver and gall both seemed torn from within.But just then on his half right, he saw another company approach and heard a cry, ""Fear not, O Prime Minister, I am here to rescue you!""The speaker was Xu Huang, and he attacked the pursuers and held them off.A move to the north seemed to promise escape, but soon they saw a camp on a hill top. Xu Huang went ahead to reconnoiter and found the officers in command were Cao Cao's Generals Ma Yan and Zhang Zi, who had once been in the service of Yuan Shao. They had three thousand of northern soldiers in camp. They had seen the sky redden with the flames, but knew not what was afoot so dared make no move.This turned out lucky for Cao Cao who now found himself with a fresh force. He sent Ma Yan and Zhang Zi, with a thousand troops, to clear the road ahead while the others remained as guard. And he felt much more secure.The two went forward, but before they had gone very far, they heard a shouting and a party of soldiers came out, the leader of them shouting, ""I am Gan Ning of Wu!""Nothing daunted the two leaders, but the redoubtable Gan Ning cut down Ma Yan. And when his brother warrior Zhang Zi set his spear and dashed forward, he too fell beneath a stroke from the fearsome sword of Gan Ning. Both leaders dead, the soldiers fled to give Cao Cao the bad news."
操此時指望合淝有兵救應，不想孫權在合淝路口，望見江中火光，知是我軍得勝，便教陸遜舉火為號；太史慈見了，與陸遜合兵一處，衝殺將來。操只得望彝陵而走。路上撞見張郃，操令斷後。縱馬加鞭，走至五更，回望火光漸遠，操心方定，問曰：「此是何處？」左右曰：「此是烏林之西，宜都之北。」,"At this time Cao Cao expected aid from Hefei, for he knew not that Sun Quan was barring the road. But when Sun Quan saw the fires and so knew that his soldiers had won the day, he ordered Lu Xun to give the answering signal. Taishi Ci seeing this came down and his force joined up with that of Lu Xun, and they went against Cao Cao.As for Cao Cao, he could only get away toward Yiling. On the road Cao Cao fell in with Zhang He and ordered him to protect the retreat. Cao Cao pressed on as quickly as possible.At the fifth watch he was a long way from the glare and he felt safer. He asked, ""What is this place?""They told him, ""It is west of the Black Forest and north of Yidu."""
操見樹林叢雜，山川險峻，乃於馬上仰面大笑不止。諸將問曰：「丞相何故大笑？」操曰：「吾不笑別人，單笑周瑜無謀，諸葛亮少智。若是吾用兵之時，預先在這裏伏下一軍，如之奈何？」,"Seeing the thickly crowded trees all about him, and the steep hills and narrow passes, Cao Cao threw up his head and laughed.Those about him asked, ""Why are you, Sir, so merry?""And he said, ""I am only laughing at the stupidity of Zhou Yu and the ignorance of Zhuge Liang. If they have only set an ambush there, as I would have done, why, there is no escape."""
說猶未了，兩邊鼓聲震響，火光沖天而起，驚得曹操幾乎墜馬。刺斜裏一彪軍殺出，大叫：「我趙子龍奉軍師將令，在此等候多時了！」操教徐晃，張郃雙敵趙雲，自己冒煙突火而去。子龍不來追趕，只顧搶奪旗幟，曹操得脫。,"Cao Cao had scarcely finished his explanation when from both sides came a deafening roll of drums and flames sprang up to heaven. Cao Cao nearly fell off his horse —-he was so startled.And from the side dashed in a troop, with Zhao Zilong leading, who cried, ""I am Zhao Zilong, and long have I been waiting here!""Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang and Zhang He to engage this new opponent, and he himself rode off into the smoke and fire. Zhao Zilong did not pursue; he only captured the banners, and Cao Cao escaped."
天色微明，黑雲罩地，東南風尚不息。忽然大雨傾盆，濕透衣甲。操與軍士冒雨而行，諸軍皆有飢色。操令軍士往村落中劫掠糧食，尋覓火種。方欲造飯，後面一軍趕到。操心甚慌。原來卻是李典，許褚保謢著眾謀士來到。,"The faint light of dawn showed a great black cloud all around, for the southeast wind had not ceased. Suddenly began a heavy downpour of rain, wetting everyone to the skin, but still Cao Cao maintained his headlong flight till the starved faces of the soldiers made a halt imperative. He told the men to forage in the villages about for grain and the means of making a fire. But when these had been found and they began to cook a meal, another pursuing party came along, and Cao Cao again was terrified. However, these proved to be Li Dian and Xu Chu escorting some of his advisers."
操大喜，令軍馬且行，問：「前面是那裏地面？」,"Cao Cao saw them with joy. When giving the order to advance again, Cao Cao asked, ""What places lay ahead?"""
人報：「一邊是南彝陵大路，一邊是北彝陵山路。」操問：「那裏投南郡江陵去近？」軍士稟曰：「取南彝陵過葫蘆口去最便。」操教走南彝陵。行至葫蘆口，軍皆飢餒，行走不上，馬亦困乏，多有倒於路者。操教前面暫歇。馬上有帶得鑼鍋的，也有村中掠得糧米的，便就山邊揀乾處埋鍋造飯，割馬肉燒吃，盡皆脫去濕衣，於風頭吹晒。馬皆摘鞍野放，咽咬草根。,"They told him, ""There are two roads. One was the highway to South Yiling, and the other a mountain road to North Yiling.""""Which is the shorter way to Jiangling?"" asked Cao Cao.""The best way is to take the south road through Hulu Valley,"" was the reply.So Cao Cao gave orders to march that way. By the time Hulu Valley was reached, the soldiers were almost starving and could march no more; horses too were worn out. Many had fallen by the roadside. A halt was then made, food was taken by force from the villagers, and as there were still some boilers left, they found a dry spot beside the hills where they could rest and cook. And there they began to prepare a meal, boiling grain, and roasting strips of horse flesh. Then they took off their wet clothes and spread them to dry. The beasts, too, were unsaddled and turned out to graze."
操坐於書疏林之下，仰面大笑。眾官問曰：「適來丞相笑周瑜，諸葛亮，引惹出趙子龍來，又折了許多人馬，如今為何又笑？」操曰：「吾笑諸葛亮，周瑜，畢竟智謀不足。若是我用兵時，就這個去處，也埋伏一彪軍馬，以逸待勞；我等縱然脫得性命，也不免重傷矣。彼見不到此，我是以笑之。」,"Seated comfortably in a somewhat open spot, Cao Cao suddenly looked up and began to laugh loud and long. His companions, remembering the sequel of his last laugh, said, ""Not long since, Sir, you laughed at Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang. That resulted in the arrival of Zhao Zilong and great loss of troops to us. Why do you now laugh?""""I am laughing again at the ignorance of the same two men. If I were in their place, and conducting their campaign, I should have had an ambush here, just to meet us when we were tired out. Then, even if we escaped with our lives, we should suffer very severely. They did not see this, and therefore I am laughing at them."""
正說間，前軍後軍一齊發喊。操大驚，棄甲上馬。眾軍多有不及收馬者。早見四下火煙布合山口，一軍擺開。為首乃燕人張翼德，橫矛立馬，大叫：「操賊走那裏去！」諸軍眾將見了張飛，盡皆膽寒。許褚騎無鞍馬來戰張飛。張遼，徐晃二將，縱馬也來夾攻。兩邊軍馬混戰做一團。操先撥馬走脫，諸將各自脫身。張飛從後趕來。操迤邐奔逃，追兵漸遠，回顧眾將多已帶傷。,"Even at that moment behind them rose a great yell. Thoroughly startled, Cao Cao threw aside his breastplate and leaped upon his horse. Most of the soldiers failed to catch theirs, and then fires sprang up on every side and filled the mouth of the valley. A force was arrayed before them and at the head was the man of ancient Yan, Zhang Fei, seated on his steed with his great spear leveled.""Whither would you flee, O rebel?"" shouted he.The soldiers grew cold within at the sight of the terrible warrior. Xu Chu, mounted on a bare-backed horse, rode up to engage him, and Zhang Liao and Xu Huang galloped up to his aid. The three gathered about Zhang Fei and a melee began, while Cao Cao made off at top speed. The other leaders set off after him, and Zhang Fei pursued. However, Cao Cao by dint of hard riding got away, and gradually the pursuers were out-distanced. But many had received wounds."
正行間，軍士稟曰：「前面有兩條路，請問丞相從那條路去？」操問：「那條路近？」軍士曰：「大路稍平，卻遠五十餘里；小路投華容道，卻近五十餘里。只是地窄路險，坑坎難行。」操令人上山觀望，回報：「小路山邊有數處煙起。大路並無動靜。」操教前軍便走華容道小路。諸將曰：「烽煙起處，必有軍馬，何故反走這條路？」操曰：「豈不聞兵書有云：『虛則實之，實則虛之。』諸葛亮多謀，故使人於山僻燒煙，使我軍不敢從這條山路走，他卻伏兵於大路等著。吾料已定，偏不教中他計！」諸將皆曰：「丞相妙算，人所不及。」遂勒兵走華容道。此時人皆飢倒，馬盡困乏。焦頭爛額者扶策而行，中箭著槍者勉強而走。衣甲濕透，個個不全。軍器旗旛，紛紛不整。大半皆是彝陵道上被趕得慌，只騎得禿馬，鞍轡衣服，盡皆拋棄。正值隆冬嚴寒之時，其苦何可勝言。,"As they were going. the soldiers said, ""There are two roads before us. Which shall we take?""""Which is the shorter?"" asked Cao Cao.""The high road is the more level, but it is fifteen miles longer than the bye road which goes to Huarong Valley. Only the latter road is narrow and dangerous, full of pits and difficult.""Cao Cao sent men up to the hill tops to look around.They returned, saying: ""There are several columns of smoke rising from the hills along the bye road. The high road seems quiet.""Then Cao Cao bade them lead the way along the bye road.""Where smoke arises there are surely soldiers,"" remarked the officers. ""Why go this way?""""Because the 'Book of War' says that the hollow is to be regarded as solid, and the solid as hollow. That fellow Zhuge Liang is very subtle and has sent people to make those fires so that we should not go that way. He has laid an ambush on the high road. I have made up my mind, and I will not fall a victim to his wiles.""""O Prime Minister, your conclusions are most admirable. None other can equal you,"" said the officers.And the soldiers were sent along the bye road. They were very hungry and many almost too weak to travel. The horses too were spent. Some had been scorched by the flames, and they rode forward resting their heads on their whips. The wounded struggled on to the last of their strength. All were soaking wet and all were feeble. Their arms and accouterments were in a deplorable state, and more than half had been left upon the road they had traversed. Few of the horses had saddles or bridles, for in the confusion of pursuit they had been left behind. It was the time of greatest winter cold, and the suffering was indescribable."
操見前軍停馬不進，問是何故。回報曰：「前面山僻路小，因早晨下雨，坑塹內積水不流，泥陷馬蹄，不能前進。」操大怒，叱曰：「軍旅逢山開路，遇水疊橋，豈有泥濘不堪行之理！」傳下號令，教老弱中傷軍士在後慢行，強壯者擔土束柴，搬草運蘆，填塞道路，務要即時行動；如違令者斬。眾軍只得都下馬，就路旁砍伐竹木，填塞山路。操恐後軍來趕，令張遼，許褚，徐晃，引百騎執刀在手，但遲慢者便斬之。,"Noticing that the leading party had stopped, Cao Cao sent to ask the reason.The messenger returned, saying, ""The rain water collected in the pits makes the ground a mire, and the horses cannot not move.""Cao Cao raged. He said, ""When soldiers come to hills, they cut a road; when they happen upon streams, they bridge them. Such a thing as mud cannot stay an army.""So he ordered the weak and wounded to go to the rear and come on as they could, while the robust and able were to cut down trees, and gather herbage and reeds to fill up the holes. And it was to be done without delay, or death would be the punishment of the disobedient or remiss.So the soldiers dismounted and felled trees and cut bamboos, and they leveled the road. And because of the imminence and fear of pursuit, a party of one hundred under Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, and Xu Huang was told off to hasten the workers and slay any that idled."
操喝令人馬沿棧而行，死者不可勝數。號哭之聲，於路不絕。操怒曰：「生死有命，何哭之有！如再哭者立斬！」三停人馬，一停落後，一停填了溝壑，一停跟隨曹操。過了險峻，路稍平坦。操回顧止有三百餘騎隨後，並無衣甲袍鎧整齊者。操催速行。眾將曰：「馬盡乏矣，只好少歇。」操曰：「趕到荊州將息未遲。」又行不到數里，操在馬上揚鞭大笑。眾將問：「丞相何又大笑？」操曰：「人皆言周瑜，諸葛亮足智多謀，以吾觀之，到底是無能之輩。若使此處伏一旅之師，吾等皆束手受縛矣。」,"The soldiers made their way along the shallower parts, but many fell, and cries of misery were heard the whole length of the way.""What are you howling for?"" cried Cao Cao. ""The number of your days is fixed by fate. Anyone who howls shall be put to death.""The remnant of the army, now divided into three, one to march slowly, a second to fill up the waterways and hollows, and a third to escort Cao Cao, gradually made its way over the precipitous road. When the going improved a little and the path was moderately level, Cao Cao turned to look at his following and saw he had barely three hundred soldiers. And these lacked clothing and armor and were tattered and disordered.But he pressed on, and when the officers told him the horses were quite spent and must rest, he replied, ""Press on to Jingzhou, and there we shall find repose.""So they pressed on. But they had gone only one or two miles when Cao Cao flourished his whip and broke once again into loud laughter.""What is there to laugh at?"" asked the officers.""People say those two, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang, are able and crafty. I do not see it. They are a couple of incapables. If an ambush had been placed here, we should all be prisoners."""
言未畢。一聲砲響，兩邊五百校刀手擺開，為首大將關雲長，提青龍刀，跨赤兔馬，截住去路。操軍見了，亡魂喪膽，面面相覷。操曰：「既到此處，只得決一死戰！」眾將曰：「人縱然不怯，馬力已乏，安能復戰？」程昱曰：「某素知雲長傲上而不忍下，欺強而不凌弱；恩怨分明，信義素著。丞相昔日有恩於彼，今只親自告之，可脫此難。」,"Cao Cao had not finished this speech when the explosion of a bomb broke the silence, and a company of five hundred troops with swords in their hands appeared and barred the way. The leader was Guan Yu, holding his green-dragon saber, bestriding the Red Hare. At this sight, the spirits of Cao Cao's soldiers left them, and they gazed into each others' faces in panic.""Now we have but one course,"" said Cao Cao. ""We must fight to the death!""""How can we?"" said the officers. ""Though the leaders may have some strength left, the horses are spent.""Cheng Yu said, ""I have always heard that Guan Yu is haughty to the proud but kindly to the humble; he despises the strong, but is gentle with the weak. He discriminates between love and hate and is always righteous and true. You, O Prime Minister, have shown him kindness in the past. If you will remind him of that, we shall escape this evil."""
操從其說，即縱馬向前，欠身謂雲長曰：「將軍別來無恙？」雲長亦欠身答曰：「關某奉軍師將令，等候丞相多時。」操曰：「曹操兵敗勢危，到此無路，望將軍以昔日之情為重。」雲長曰：「昔日關某雖蒙丞相厚恩，然已斬顏良，誅文醜，解白馬之圍，以奉報矣。今日之事，豈敢以私廢公？」操曰：「五關斬將之時，還能記否？大丈夫以信義為重。將軍深明春秋，豈不知庾公之斯追子濯孺子之事乎？」,"Cao Cao agreed to try. He rode out to the front, bowed low and said, ""General, I trust you have enjoyed good health.""""I had orders to await you, O Prime Minister,"" replied Guan Yu, bowing in return, ""and I have been expecting you these many days.""""You see before you one Cao Cao —-defeated and weak. I have reached a sad pass, and I trust you, O General, will not forget the kindness of former days.""""Though indeed you were kind to me in those days, yet I slew your enemies for you and relieved the siege of Baima. As to the business of today, I cannot allow private feelings to outweigh public duty.""""Do you remember my six generals, slain at the five passes? The noble person values righteousness. You are well versed in the histories and must recall the action of Yu Gong, the archer, when he released his master Zi Zhuo, for he determined not to use Zi Zhuo's teaching to kill Zi Zhuo."""
雲長是個義重如山之人，想起當日曹操許多恩義，與後來五關斬將之事，如何不動心？又見曹軍惶惶皆欲垂淚，越發心中不忍。於是把馬頭勒回，謂眾軍曰：「四散擺開。」這個分明是放曹操的意思。操見雲長回馬，便和眾將一齊衝將過去。雲長回身時，曹操已與眾將過去了。雲長大喝一聲，眾軍皆下馬，哭拜於地。雲長愈加不忍。正猶豫間，張遼驟馬而至，雲長見了，又動故舊之情；長歎一聲，並皆放去，後人有詩曰：曹瞞兵敗走華容，正與關公狹路逢。只為當初恩義重，放開金鎖走蛟龍。,"Guan Yu was indeed a very mountain of goodness and could not forget the great kindness he had received at Cao Cao's hands, and the magnanimity Cao Cao had shown over the deeds at the five passes. He saw the desperate straits to which his benefactor was reduced, and tears were very near to the eyes of both. He could not press Cao Cao hard.He pulled at the bridle of his steed and turned away saying to his followers, ""Break up the formation!""From this it was evident that his design was to release Cao Cao, who then went on with his officers. When Guan Yu turned to look back, they had all passed. He uttered a great shout, and Cao Cao's soldiers jumped off their horses and knelt on the ground crying for mercy. But he also had pity for them. Then Zhang Liao, whom he knew well, came along and was allowed to go free also.Cao Cao, his army lost, fled to the Huarong Valley;There in the throat of the gorge met he Guan Yu.Grateful was Guan Yu, and mindful of former kindness,Wherefore slipped he the bolt and freed the imprisoned dragon."
曹操既脫華容之難，行至谷口，回顧所隨軍兵，止有二十七騎。比及天晚，已近南郡，火把齊明，一簇人馬攔路。操大驚曰：「吾命休矣！」只見一群哨馬衝到，方認得是曹仁軍馬。操纔心安。曹仁接著，言：「雖知兵敗，不敢遠離，只得在附近迎接。」操曰：「幾與汝不相見也！」,"Having escaped this danger, Cao Cao hastened to get out of the valley. As the throat opened out, he glanced behind him and saw only forty-seven horsemen. As evening fell, they reached Jiangling, and they came upon an army that they took to be more enemies.Cao Cao thought the end had surely come, but to his delight they were his own soldiers and he regained all his confidence.Cao Ren, who was the leader, said, ""I heard of your misfortunes, my lord, but I was afraid to venture far from my charge, else I would have met you before.""""I thought I would never see you again,"" said Cao Cao."
於是引眾入南郡安歇。隨後張遼也到，說雲長之德。操點將校中傷者極多，操皆令將息。曹仁置酒與操解悶。眾謀士俱在座。操忽仰天大慟。眾謀士曰：「丞相於虎窟中逃難之時，全無懼怯；今到城中，人已得食，馬已得料，正須整頓軍馬復仇，何反痛哭？」操曰：「吾哭郭奉孝耳！若奉孝在，決不使吾有此大失也！」遂搥胸大哭曰：「哀哉，奉孝！痛哉，奉孝！惜哉，奉孝！」眾謀士皆默然自慚。,"The fugitives found repose in the city, where Zhang Liao soon joined them. He also praised the magnanimity of Guan Yu.When Cao Cao mustered the miserable remnant of his officers, he found nearly all were wounded and he bade them rest. Cao Ren poured the wine of consolation whereby his master might forget his sorrows.As Cao Cao drank among his familiars, he became exceedingly sad.Wherefore they said, ""O Prime Minister, when you were in the cave of the tiger and trying to escape, you showed no sign of sorrow. Now that you are safe in a city, where you have food and the horses have forage, where all you have to do is to prepare for revenge, suddenly you lose heart and grieve. Why thus?""Replied Cao Cao, ""I am thinking of my friend Guo Jia: Had he been alive, he would not have let me suffer this loss.""He beat his breast and wept, saying, ""Alas for Guo Jia! I grieve for Guo Jia! I sorrow for Guo Jia!""The reproach shamed the advisers, who were silent."
次日，操喚曹仁曰：「吾今暫回許都，收拾軍馬，必來報讎。汝可保全南郡。吾有一計，密留在此，非急休開，急則開之。依計而行，使東吳不敢正視南郡。」仁曰：「合淝，襄陽，誰可保守？」操曰：「荊州託汝管領；襄陽吾已撥夏侯惇守把。合淝最為緊要之地，吾命張遼為主將，樂進，李典為副將，保守此地。但有緩急，飛報將來。」,"Next day Cao Cao called Cao Ren and said, ""I am going to the capital to prepare another army for revenge. You are to guard this region and, in case of necessity, I leave with you a sealed plan. You are only to open the cover when hard-pressed, and then you are to act as directed. The South Land will not dare to look this way.""""Who is to guard Hefei and Xiangyang?""""Jingzhou is particularly your care, and Xiahou Dun is to hold Xiangyang. As Hefei is most important, I am sending Zhang Liao thither with good aids of Li Dian and Yue Jing. If you get into difficulties, send at once to tell me."""
操分撥已定，遂上馬引眾奔回許昌。荊州原降文武各官，依舊帶回許昌調用。曹仁自遺曹洪據守彝陵，南郡，以防周瑜。,"Having made these dispositions, Cao Cao set off at once with a few followers. He took with him the officers who had come over to his side when Jingzhou fell into his hands.Cao Ren placed Cao Hong in charge of Yiling and Jiangling."
卻說關雲長放了曹操，引軍自回。此時諸路軍馬，皆得馬匹、器械、錢糧，已回夏口；獨雲長不獲一人一騎，空身回見玄德。孔明正與玄德作賀，忽報雲長至。孔明忙離坐席，執盃相迎曰：「且喜將軍立此蓋世之功，與普天下除大害。合宜遠慶賀。」,"After having allowed the escape of Cao Cao, Guan Yu found his way back to headquarters. By this time the other detachments had returned bringing spoil of horses and weapons and supplies of all kinds. Only Guan Yu came back empty-handed. When he arrived, Zhuge Liang was with his brother congratulating him on his success. When Guan Yu was announced, Zhuge Liang got up and went to welcome him, bearing a cup of wine.""Joy! O General,"" said Zhuge Liang. ""You have done a deed that overtops the world. You have removed the empire's worst foe and ought to have been met at a distance and felicitated."""
