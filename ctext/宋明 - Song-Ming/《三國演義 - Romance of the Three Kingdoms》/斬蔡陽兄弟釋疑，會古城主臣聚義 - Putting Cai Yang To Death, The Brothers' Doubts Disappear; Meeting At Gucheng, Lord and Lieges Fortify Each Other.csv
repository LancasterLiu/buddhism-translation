卻說關公同孫乾保二嫂向汝南進發，不想夏侯惇領二百餘騎，從後追來。孫乾保車仗前行。關公回身勒馬按刀問曰：「汝來趕我，有失丞相大度。」夏侯惇曰：「丞相無明文傳報，汝於路殺人，又斬吾部將，無禮太甚！我特來擒你，獻與丞相發落！」,"Sun Qian had joined Guan Yu in escorting the two ladies, and they were on the road to Runan when Xiahou Dun suddenly determined to pursue. So with a couple of hundred horse, Xiahou Dun set out. When Xiahou Dun was seen approaching, Guan Yu bade Sun Qian go ahead with the carriage while he remained to deal with the pursuers.When they were near enough, Guan Yu said, ""In coming after me thus you do not reinforce the magnanimity of your master!""Replied Xiahou Dun, ""The Prime Minister has sent no definite instructions. You have caused the death of several people, among them one of my commanders, and so I have come to capture you! You have behaved most grossly. The Prime Minister will decide."""
言訖，便拍馬挺鎗欲鬥。只見後面一騎飛來，大叫「不可與雲長交戰！」關公按轡不動。來使於懷中取出公文，謂夏侯惇曰：「丞相敬愛關將軍忠義，恐於路關隘攔截，故遣某持齎公文，遍行諸處。」惇曰：「關某於路，殺把關將士，丞相知否？」來使曰：「此卻未知。」惇曰：「我只活捉他去見丞相，待丞相自放他。」關公怒曰：「吾豈懼汝耶！」拍馬持刀，直取夏侯惇。,"Thereupon Xiahou Dun dashed forward with his spear ready to thrust.But at that moment a rider came up behind him at full gallop, crying, ""You must not fight with Guan Yu!""Guan Yu stayed his steed at once and waited.The messenger came up, drew from his bosom an official letter, and said to Xiahou Dun, ""The Prime Minister loves General Guan Yu for his loyalty and honor, and fearing lest Guan Yu might be stopped at the various passes, he sent me with this letter to show when necessary at any point on the road.""""But this Guan Yu has slain several commanders of the passes. Does the Prime Minister know that?"" said Xiahou Dun.The messenger said these things were unknown.""Then,"" said Xiahou Dun, ""I will arrest him and take him to the Prime Minister, who may set him free or not as he wills.""""Do you think I fear anything you can do?"" said Guan Yu getting wrathful.And he rode forward. Xiahou Dun, nothing loth, set his spear and prepared for battle."
惇挺鎗來迎。兩馬相交，戰不十合，忽又一騎飛至，大叫「二將軍少歇！」惇停鎗問來使曰：「丞相叫擒關某乎？」使者曰：「非也。丞相恐守關諸將阻擋關將軍，故又差某馳公文來放行。」惇曰：「丞相知其於路殺人否？」使者曰：「未知。」惇曰：「既未知其殺人，不可放去。」指揮手下軍士，將關公圍住。關公大怒，舞刀迎戰。,"They met and had reached the tenth encounter when a second horseman came up at full speed, crying, ""Generals, wait a little!""Xiahou Dun stayed his hand and asked the messenger, saying, ""Am I to arrest him?""""No,"" replied the messenger. ""Fearing lest he should have difficulties at the passes, the Prime Minister has sent me with a dispatch to say he is to be released.""""Did the Prime Minister know that he had slain several commanders on the way?""""He did not know!""""Since he was ignorant of that, I may not let this Guan Yu go,"" and Xiahou Dun gave the signal to his men to close in round Guan Yu.But Guan Yu flourished his sword and made to attack them."
兩個正欲交鋒，陣後一人飛馬而來，大叫：「雲長，元讓，休得爭戰！」眾視之，乃張遼也。二人各勒住馬。張遼近前言曰：「奉丞相鈞旨：因聞知雲長斬關殺將，恐於路有阻，特差我傳諭各處關隘，任便放行。」惇曰：「秦琪是蔡陽之甥。他將秦琪託付我處，今被關某所殺，怎肯干休？」遼曰：「我見蔡將軍，自有分解。既丞相大度，教放雲長去，公等不可廢丞相之意。」夏侯惇只得將軍馬約退。遼曰：「雲長今欲何往？」關公曰：「聞兄長又不在袁紹處，吾今將遍天下尋之。」遼曰：「既未知玄德下落，且再回見丞相，若何？」關公笑曰：「安有是理！文遠回見丞相，幸為我謝罪。」說畢，與張遼拱手而別。,"A fight was again imminent, when a third rider appeared, who cried, ""Guan Yu, give way and do not fight!"" The speaker was Zhang Liao. Both combatants made no further move but awaited his arrival.Zhang Liao said, ""I bring the Prime Minister's order that since he has heard that Guan Yu has slain certain commanders on the way, he fears that some will hinder his passage. Wherefore he has sent me to deliver his command at each gate that Guan Yu is to be suffered to pass freely.""Xiahou Dun said, ""Qin Qi was the son of Cai Yang's sister, and he was confided to my especial care. Now this Guan Yu has killed him, and how can I refrain?""""When I see his uncle Cai Yang, I will explain. But now the main point is that you have the Prime Minister's orders to let Guan Yu pass and you may not despise his wish.""So the only thing for Xiahou Dun to do was to retire, and he did.""Whither are you going?"" then said Zhang Liao to Guan Yu.""I fear my brother is no longer with Yuan Shao, and now I am going to find him wherever he is.""""As you do not know where to go, why not return to the Prime Minister?""""Where is the sense of that?"" said Guan Yu with a smile. ""But, Zhang Liao, you return, and try to arrange pardon for my faults.""With this Guan Yu saluted Zhang Liao and took his leave."
於是張遼與夏侯惇領兵自回。關公趕上車仗，與孫乾說知此事。二人並馬而行。行了數日，忽值大雨滂沱，行裝盡濕。遙望山岡邊有一所莊院，關公引著車仗，到彼借宿。莊內一老人出迎。關公具言來意。老人曰：「某姓郭，名常，世居於此。久聞大名，幸得瞻拜。」遂宰羊置酒相待，請二夫人於後堂暫歇。郭常陪關公，孫乾於草堂飲酒。一邊烘焙行李，一邊餵養馬匹。,"Zhang Liao retired and joined Xiahou Dun.Guan Yu quickly regained the carriage, and as they went along side by side he told Sun Qian what had happened. Several days later a heavy rain storm came on which soaked everything. Looking about for protection they noticed a farm under the shelter of a precipice and took their way thither. An old man came out to them, to whom they told their story.When they had finished, the old fellow said, ""My name is Guo Chang, and I have lived here many years. I am very pleased to greet the man whom I have known so long by reputation.""Guo Chang quickly killed a sheep for their refreshment and brought out wine for the two men. The two ladies were entertained in the inner apartments. And while they refreshed themselves, their baggage was put out to dry and their steeds were fed."
至黃昏時候，忽見一少年，引數人入莊，逕上草堂。郭常喚曰：「吾兒來拜將軍。」因謂關公曰：「此愚男也。」關公問何來。常曰：「射獵方回。」少年見過關公，即下堂去了。常流涕言曰：「老夫耕讀傳家，止生此子，不務本業，惟以游獵為事。是家門不幸也！」關公曰：「方今亂世，若武藝精熟，亦可以取功名，何云不幸？」常曰：「他若肯習武藝，便是有志之人；今專務游蕩，無所不為，老夫所以憂耳！」,"As the day closed in, they saw several youths come along, and their host said, ""My son is come to pay his respects.""""This is my humble son,"" said Guo Chang, presenting a lad to Guan Yu.""What has he been doing?"" asked Guan Yu.""He has just come in from hunting.""The young fellow went out. The old man continued, ""All my family have been farmers or scholars. He is my only son, and instead of following in the footsteps of his ancestors he cares for nothing but gadding about and hunting, unhappily.""""Why unhappily?"" said Guan Yu. ""In these days of disorder a good soldier can make a name for himself.""""If he would only learn the military arts, that would be something of a career. But he is nothing but a vagabond and does everything he should not. He is a grief to me."""
關公亦為歎息。至更深，郭常辭出。關公與孫乾方欲就寢，忽聞後院馬嘶人叫。關公急喚從人，卻都不應，乃與孫乾提劍往視之。只見郭常之子倒在地上叫喚，從人正與莊客廝打。公問其故。從人曰：「此人來盜赤兔馬，被馬踢倒。我等聞叫喚之聲，起來巡看，莊客們反來廝鬧。」公怒曰：「鼠賊焉敢盜吾馬！」,"Guan Yu sighed in sympathy. The old gentleman stayed till a late hour; and when he took his leave, his two guests began to prepare for rest.Suddenly outside there arose a great hubbub, men shouting and horses neighing.Guan Yu called to his people; but as no one answered, he and Sun Qian drew their swords and went into the stable yard. There they found their host's son on the ground shouting to his followers to fight.Guan Yu asked what it was all about, and his guards told him, ""The young fellow had tried to steal Red Hare, but had been badly kicked. We heard shouting and went to see what it meant when his men had set on us.""Guan Yu was very wrathful.""You mean thieves! Would you steal my horse?"" cried he."
恰待發作，郭常奔至告曰：「不肖子為此歹事，罪合萬死！奈老妻最憐愛此子，乞將軍仁慈寬恕！」關公曰：「此子果然不肖，適纔老翁所言，真知子莫若父也。我看翁面，且姑恕之。」遂分付從人看好了馬，喝散莊客，與孫乾回草堂歇息。次日，郭常夫婦出拜於堂前，謝曰：「犬子冒瀆虎威，深感將軍恩恕。」關公令將喚出，我以正言教之。常曰：「他於四更時分，又引數個無賴之徒，不知何處去了。」,"But before he could do anything, his host came running out, saying, ""It was not with my consent that my son did this evil thing. I know he is very guilty and deserves death. But his mother loves him tenderly, and I pray you be generous and pardon him!""""Really he is unworthy of his father,"" said Guan Yu. ""What you told me shows he is a degenerate. For your sake I pardon him.""Then Guan Yu told his own people to keep a better lookout, sent the people about their business and, in company with Sun Qian, went away to rest.Next morning both the host and hostess were up betimes waiting to thank Guan Yu for forgiving their son's mad freak.""My son has insulted your tiger dignity, I know, and I am deeply affected by your kindness in not punishing him,"" said the old man.""Bring him here and I will talk to him,"" said Guan Yu.""He went out before daylight with a lot of his fellow rogues, and I know not where he is."""
關公謝別郭常，奉二嫂上車，出了莊院，與孫乾並馬，護著車仗，取山路而行。不及三十里，只見山背後擁出百餘人，為首兩騎馬。前面那人，頭裹黃巾，身穿戰袍；後面乃郭常之子也。黃巾者曰：「我乃天公將軍張角部將也！來者快留下赤兔馬，放你過去！」關公大笑曰：「無知狂賊！汝既從張角為盜，亦知劉，關，張兄弟三人名字否？」黃巾者曰：「我只聞赤面長髯者名關雲長，卻未識其面。汝何人也？」,"So Guan Yu bade them farewell, got the ladies into their carriage, and they moved out of the farmyard. Guan Yu and Sun Qian riding abreast as escort. They took the road toward the hills.Before they had gone far, they saw a large party of men, led by a couple of riders, pouring down one of the gullies.One of the riders wore a yellow turban and a battle robe. The other was Guo Chang's son.The wearer of the turban called out, saying, ""I am one of the commanders of Zhang Jue the Lord of Heaven. Whoever you may be, leave that horse you are riding for me. You may then go free!""Guan Yu greeted the speech with a hearty laugh.""O you mad ignoramus! If you had ever been with Zhang Jue as a bandit, you would have learned to know Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei, the three brothers.""""I have heard of the ruddy long beard called Guan Yu, but I have never seen him. Who may you be?"""
公乃停刀立馬，解開鬚囊，出長髯令視之。其人滾鞍下馬，腦揪郭常之子拜獻於馬前。關公問其姓名。告曰：「某姓裴，名元紹。自張角死後，一向無主，嘯聚山林，權於此處藏伏。今早這廝來報：有一客人，騎一匹千里馬，在我家投宿。特邀某來劫奪此馬。不想卻遇將軍。」郭常之子拜伏乞命。關公曰：「吾看汝父之面，饒你性命！」,"Guan Yu then laid aside his sword, stopped his horse, and drew off the bag that covered his beard thus showing its magnificence.The turban wearer immediately slipped out of the saddle, laid an angry hand on his companion, and they both bowed low in front of Guan Yu's steed.""Who are you?"" asked Guan Yu.""I am Pei Yuanshao. After the death of Zhang Jue, I was left forlorn; and I got together a few others like myself, and we took refuge in the forests. This morning early this fellow came to tell us that a guest at his father's farm had a valuable horse and proposed to me to steal it. I did not think I should meet you, General.""The wretched Guo Chang's son implored that his life might be spared, and Guan Yu pardoned him for his father's sake."
郭子抱頭鼠竄而去。公謂元紹曰：「汝不識吾面，何以知吾名？」元紹曰：「離此二十里有一臥牛山。山上有一關西人，姓周，名倉，兩臂有千斤之力。面孔虯髯，形容甚偉。原在黃巾張寶部下為將，張寶死，嘯聚山林。他多曾與某說將軍盛名，恨無門路相見。」關公曰：「綠林中非豪傑托足之處。公等今後可各去邪歸正，勿自陷其身。」元紹拜謝。,"Then Guo's son covered his face and crept away.""You did not recognize me. How then did you know my name?"" asked Guan Yu.Pei Yuanshao replied, ""Not far from here is a mountain called the Sleeping Bull, where lives a certain Zhou Cang, a very powerful man who came from the west.He has a stiff curly beard and looks very handsome. He also was a commander in the rebel army, who took to the forest when his leader perished. He has told me a lot about you, but I have never had the happiness of seeing you.""Said Guan Yu, ""Under the green wood trees is no place for a hero's foot. You had better abandon this depraved life and return to the path of virtue. Do not work out your own destruction."""
正說話間，遙望一彪人馬來到。元紹曰：「此必周倉也。」關公乃立馬待之。果見一人，黑面長身，持槍乘馬，引眾而至；見了關公，驚喜曰：「此關將軍也！」疾忙下馬俯，伏道傍曰：「周倉參拜。」關公曰：「壯士何處曾識關某來？」倉曰：「舊隨黃巾張寶時，曾識尊顏；恨失身賊黨，不得相隨。今日幸得拜見。願將軍不棄，收為步卒，早晚執鞭隨鐙，死亦甘心！」公見其意甚誠，乃謂曰：「汝若隨我，汝手下人伴若何？」倉曰：「願從則俱從；不願從者，聽之可也。」,"As they were talking, a troop of horsemen appeared in the distance. They belonged to Zhou Cang, as Pei Yuanshao said, and Guan Yu waited for them to approach. The leader was very dark complexioned, tall, and armed with a spear.As soon as he drew near enough to see, he exclaimed joyfully, ""This is General Guan Yu!""In a moment he had slipped out of the saddle and was on his knees by the roadside.""Zhou Cang renders obeisance,"" said he.Said Guan Yu, ""O Warrior, where have you known me?""""I was one of the Yellow Scarves, and I saw you then. My one regret was that I could not join you. Now that my good fortune has brought me here, I hope you will not reject me. Let me be one of your foot soldiers to be always near you to carry your whip and run by your stirrup. I will cheerfully die for you.""As he seemed thoroughly in earnest, Guan Yu said, ""But if you follow me, what of your companions?""""They may do as they please: Follow me or go their ways."""
於是眾人皆曰：「願從。」關公乃下馬至車前稟問二嫂。甘夫人曰：「叔叔自離許都，於路獨行至此，歷過多少艱難，未嘗要軍馬相隨；前廖化欲相投，叔既卻之，今何獨容周倉之眾耶？我輩女流淺見，叔自斟酌。」公曰：「嫂嫂之言是也。」遂謂周倉曰：「非關某寡情，奈二夫人不從。汝等且回山中，待我尋見兄長，必來相招。」周倉頓首告曰：「倉乃一粗莽之夫，失身為盜；今遇將軍，如重見天日，豈忍復錯過？若以眾人相隨為不便，可令其盡跟裴元紹去。倉隻身步行，跟隨將軍，雖萬里不辭也！」關公再以此言告二嫂。甘夫人曰：「一二人相從，無妨於事。」公乃令周倉撥人伴隨裴元紹去。元紹曰：「我亦願隨關將軍。」周倉曰：「汝若去時，人伴皆散；且當權時統領。我隨關將軍去，但有住紮處，便來取你。」,"Thereupon they all shouted, ""We will follow!""Guan Yu dismounted and went to ask the ladies what they thought of this.Lady Gan replied, ""Brother-in-law, you have traveled thus far alone and without fighters; you have safely passed many dangers and never wanted their assistance. You refused the service of Liao Hua, why then suffer this crowd? But this is only a my view and you must decide.""""What you say, sister-in-law, is to the point.""Therefore returning to Zhou Cang, he said, ""It is not that I am lacking in gratitude, but my sisters-in-law do not care for a large following. Wherefore return to the mountains till I shall have found my brother, when I will surely call you.""Zhou Cang replied, ""I am only a rough uncouth fellow, wasting his life as a brigand. Meeting you, General, is like seeing the full sun in the skies, and I feel that I can never bear to miss you again. As it might be inconvenient for all my people to follow you, I will bid my companion lead them away, but I will come and follow you on foot wherever you go.""Guan Yu again asked his sisters-in-law what they thought of this. Lady Gan said one or two made no difference, and so Guan Yu consented. But Pei Yuanshao was not satisfied with this arrangement and said he wished also to follow.Zhou Cang said, ""If you do not stay with the band, they will disperse and be lost. You must take command for the moment and let me accompany General Guan Yu. As soon as he has a fixed abode, I will come to fetch you."""
元紹怏怏而別。周倉跟著關公，往汝南進發。行了數日，遙見一座山城。公問土人：「此何處也？」土人曰：「此名古城。數月前有一將軍，姓張，名飛，引數十騎到此，將縣官逐去，占住古城，招軍買馬，積草屯糧。今聚有三五千人馬，四遠無人敢敵。」關公喜曰：「吾弟自徐州失散，一向不知下落，誰想卻在此！」乃令孫乾先入城通報，教來迎接二嫂。卻說張飛在芒碭山中，住了月餘，因出外探聽玄德消息，偶過古城，入縣借糧；縣官不肯，飛怒，因就逐去縣官，奪了縣印，占住城池，權且安身。當日孫乾領關公命，入城見飛。施禮畢，具言：「玄德離了袁紹處，投汝南去了。今雲長直從許都送二位夫人至此，請將軍出迎。」,"Somewhat discontentedly Pei Yuanshao accepted the situation and marched off, while his one-time colleague joined the train of Guan Yu, and they went toward Runan.They traveled quickly for some days, and then they saw a city on a hill.The natives told them, ""This city is called Gucheng. A few months before a warrior suddenly appeared, drove out the magistrate, and took possession. Then he has begun to recruit soldiers, bought up horses, and laid in stores. The warrior's name is Zhang Fei. Now he has a large force, and no one in the neighborhood dare face him.""""To think that I should find my brother like this!"" said Guan Yu, delighted. ""I have had never a word of him, nor knew I where he was since Xuzhou fell.""So Guan Yu dispatched Sun Qian into the city to tell its new commander to come out to meet him and provide for their sisters-in-law.Now, after being separated from his brothers, Zhang Fei had gone to the Mangdang Hills, where he had remained a month or so while he sent far and near for tidings of Liu Bei. Then as he happened to pass Gucheng, he had sent in to borrow some grain, but had been refused. In revenge, he had driven away the magistrate and taken possession of the city. He found the place well suited to his needs at the moment.As directed by Guan Yu, Sun Qian entered the city and, after the usual ceremonies, told Zhang Fei the news, ""Liu Bei has left Yuan Shao and gone to Runan; and Guan Yu, with your sisters-in-law, is at the gates. He wishes you to go out and receive them."""
張飛聽罷，更不回言，隨即披挂持丈八矛上馬，引一千餘人，逕出北城門。孫乾驚訝，又不敢問，只得隨出城來。關公望見張飛到來，喜不自勝；付刀與周倉接了，拍馬來迎。只見張飛圓睜環眼，倒豎虎鬚，吼聲如雷，揮矛向關公便搠。關公大驚，連忙閃過，便叫：「賢弟何故如此？豈忘了桃園結義耶？」飛喝曰：「你既無義，有何面目來與我相見！」關公曰：「我如何無義？」飛曰：「你背了兄長，降了曹操，封侯賜爵。今又來賺我！我今與你併個死活！」關公曰：「你原來不知，我也難說。現放著二位嫂嫂在此，賢弟請自問。」,"Zhang Fei listened without a word till he came to the request to go out to meet his brother. At that point he called for his armor and, when he had put it on, laid hold of his long serpent halberd, mounted, and rode out with a large company at his back. Sun Qian was too astonished to ask what this meant and simply followed.Guan Yu was very glad when he saw his brother coming, put up his weapons and, with Zhou Cang at his back, rode toward him at full speed.But as Guan Yu approached, he saw all the signs of fierce anger on Zhang Fei's face, and Zhang Fei roared as he shook his spear, threatening Guan Yu.Guan Yu was entirely taken aback and called out anxiously, ""Brother, what does this mean? Is the Peach Garden Pledge quite forgotten?""""What impudence is this that you come to see me since your disgraceful behavior?"" shouted Zhang Fei.""What disgraceful behavior has been mine?"" said Guan Yu.""You have betrayed your brother; you have surrendered to Cao Cao; and you have received title and office at his hands. And now you are come to exploit me. One of us shall die!""Guan Yu said, ""Really you do not understand, and it is hard for me to explain. But ask the two ladies here, worthy brother, and they will tell you."""
二夫人聽得，揭簾而呼曰：「三叔何故如此？」飛曰：「嫂嫂住著。且看我殺了負義的人，然後請嫂嫂入城。」甘夫人曰：「二叔因不知你等下落，故暫時棲身曹氏。今知你哥哥在汝南，特不避險阻，送我們們到此。三叔休錯見了。」糜夫人曰：「二叔向在許都，原出於無奈。」飛曰：「嫂嫂休要被他瞞過了！忠臣寧死而不辱。大丈夫豈有事二主之理！」關公曰：「賢弟休屈了我。」孫乾曰：「雲長特來尋將軍。」飛喝曰：「如何你也胡說！他那裏有好心！必是來捉我！」關公曰：「我若捉你，須帶軍馬來。」飛把手指曰：「兀的不是軍馬來也！」,"At this the ladies lifted the curtain of the carriage and called out: ""Brother, why is this?""Zhang Fei said, ""Wait a while, sisters, and see me slay this traitor. After that I will conduct you into the city.""Said Lady Gan, ""Since he knew not where you were, our brother took shelter with Cao Cao. And since he knew that his elder brother was at Runan, he has braved every danger to escort us thus far on the road.Pray take a correct view of his conduct.""Lady Mi also chimed in, ""When your brother went to Xuchang, no other course was open to him.""""Sisters, do not let him deceive you to the truth. Real loyalty prefers death to dishonor. No good person can serve two masters.""Guan Yu said, ""Brother, cease to wrench me I pray you.""Sun Qian said, ""Guan Yu came expressly to seek you.""""How much more nonsense will you talk?"" roared Zhang Fei. ""How can he be true-hearted? He came to capture me, I say.""""Had I come to capture you, I should have come with troops and horses,"" said Guan Yu.""And are there not troops and horses?"" said Zhang Fei pointing to a point behind Guan Yu."
關公回顧，果見塵埃起處，一彪人馬來到。風吹旗號，正是曹軍。張飛大怒曰：「今還敢支吾麼？」挺丈八蛇矛便搠將來。關公急止之曰：「賢弟且住，你看我斬此來將，以表我真心。」飛曰：「你果有真心，我這裏三通鼓罷，便要你斬來將！」關公應諾。,"Guan Yu turned, and there he saw a cloud of dust rising as though a squadron of horse was coming. And soon they were near enough, and from their trumpets and banners they showed themselves to be of Cao Cao's army.""Now will you try to cajole me further?"" cried Zhang Fei in a rage.He set his serpent halberd and was just coming on when Guan Yu said, ""Brother, wait a while. See me slay the leader of these that I may prove myself no traitor.""""Well, if you are really true, prove it by slaying that leader, whoever he may be, before I have finished three rolls of the drum."" Zhang Fei's condition was accepted."
須臾，曹軍至。為首一將，乃是蔡陽，挺刀縱馬大喝曰：「你殺吾外甥秦琪，卻原來逃在此！吾奉丞相命，特來拿你！」關公更不打話，舉刀便砍。張飛親自擂鼓。只見一通鼓未盡，關公刀起處，蔡陽頭已落地。眾軍士俱走。關公活捉執認旗的小卒過來，問取來由。小卒告說：「蔡陽聞將軍殺了他外甥，十分忿怒，要來河北與將軍交戰。丞相不肯，因差他往汝南攻劉辟。不想在這裏遇著將軍。」關公聞言，教去張飛前告說其事。飛將關公在許都時事細問小卒；小卒從頭至尾，說了一遍，飛方纔信。,"Soon the attacking force was near enough to make out the leader to be Cai Yang.Sword in hand Cai Yang rode at full speed, crying, ""So I have found you, slayer of my nephew! I have a command to capture you and will execute it.""Guan Yu made no reply. Raising his sword ready to strike, he moved out and the drums began to beat. Before a roll could be completed the fight was over, and Cai Yang's head had rolled on the ground. His force scattered and fled. Guan Yu, however, captured the young ensign bearer and questioned him.The youth said, ""The fact is the Prime Minister had not given an order. Incensed at the loss of his nephew, Cai Yang wished to cross the river to pursue and attack you, General, although the Prime Minister refused permission. To satisfy him, the Prime Minister had sent Cai Yang to attack Runan, and the meeting at this place is entirely an accident.""Guan Yu bade him repeat this story to his brother. Zhang Fei also questioned him concerning all that had happened in the capital, and the recital of the whole story satisfied Zhang Fei of the fidelity of Guan Yu."
正說間，忽城中軍士來報：「城南門外有十數騎來的甚緊，不知是甚人。」張飛心中疑慮，便轉出南門看時，果見十數騎輕弓短箭而來。見了張飛，滾鞍下馬。視之，乃糜竺，糜芳也。飛亦下馬相見。竺曰：「自徐州失散，我兄弟二人逃難回鄉。使人遠近打聽，知雲長降了曹操，主公在於河北；又聞簡雍亦投河北去了。只不知將軍在此。昨於路上遇見一夥客人說：有一姓張的將軍，如此模樣，今據古城。我兄弟度量必是將軍，故來尋訪。幸得相見！」飛曰：「雲長兄與孫乾送二嫂方到，已知哥哥下落。」,"Just then messengers came from the city to Zhang Fei to say: ""Some scores of horsemen has arrived at the south gate. They seem in a great hurry but no one know them.""Zhang Fei, with still a lingering doubt in his mind, went to look at the newcomers and there saw some forty mounted archers with light bows and short arrows. Hastily dismounting to see them better, he found they were Mi Zhu and Mi Fang.Quickly slipping out of the saddle, they came up and Mi Zhu said, ""After the dispersal at Xuzhou when we lost sight of you, we returned to our village whence we sent all around for news of you. We heard that Guan Yu had surrendered to Cao Cao and our lord was in the North of Yellow River with Yuan Shao. The one of whom we could hear nothing was yourself. But yesterday, while on our way, we fell in with some travelers who told us a certain General Zhang Fei, of such and such an appearance, had suddenly occupied Gucheng, and we felt it must be you. So we came to inquire, and we happily fell in with you here.""Zhang Fei replied, ""Guan Yu and Sun Qian are here, and my two sisters are with them. They had heard where my elder brother was."""
二糜大喜，同來見關公，并參見二夫人。飛遂迎請二嫂入城。至衙中坐定，二夫人訴說關公歷過之事，張飛方纔大哭，參拜雲長。二糜亦俱傷感。張飛亦自訴別後之事，一面設宴賀喜。,"This news added to the joy of the two newcomers who went to see Guan Yu and the women, and then they all entered the city. When the ladies had settled down a little, they related the whole story of the adventures on the road at which Zhang Fei was overcome with remorse and bowed before his brother bitterly weeping. Mi Zhu and Mi Fang were greatly affected. Then Zhang Fei related what had happened to him. A day was spent in banquets,"
次日，張飛欲與關公同赴汝南見玄德。關公曰：「賢弟可保護二嫂，暫住此城，待我與孫乾先去探聽兄長消息。」飛允諾。關公與孫乾引數騎奔汝南來。劉辟，龔都，接著，關公便問：皇叔何在？劉辟曰：「皇叔到此住了數日，為見軍少，復往河北袁本初處商議去了。」關公怏怏不樂。孫乾曰：「不必憂慮。再苦一番驅馳，仍往河北去報知皇叔，同至古城便了。」,"Next day Zhang Fei wished his newly found brother to go with him to Runan to see their elder brother Liu Bei.But Guan Yu said, ""No. you take care of the ladies here while Sun Qian and I go to get news.""So Guan Yu and Sun Qian with a small escort set out. When they reached Runan, they were received by Liu Pi.""Liu Bei is no longer in the city. After waiting some days, he has come to the conclusion that the soldiers are too few, and has gone back to Yuan Shao to consult with him,"" said Liu Pi.Guan Yu was greatly disappointed, and Sun Qian did his best to console him, saying, ""Do not be sorrowful. It only means the trouble of another journey into the North of Yellow River to tell Uncle Liu Bei, and then we can all meet at Gucheng."" So spoke Sun Qian."
關公依言，辭了劉辟，龔都，回至古城，與張飛說知此事。張飛便欲同至河北。關公曰：「有此一城，便是我等安身之處，未可輕棄。我還與孫乾同往袁紹處，尋見兄長，來此相會。賢弟可堅守此城。」飛曰：「兄斬他顏良，文醜，如何去得？」關公曰：「不妨。我到彼當見機而行。」遂喚周倉問曰：「臥牛山裴元紹處，共有多少人馬？」倉曰：「約有四五百。」關公曰：「我今抄近路去尋兄長。汝可往臥牛山招此一枝人馬，從大路上接來。」,"Guan Yu accepted it. They took leave of Liu Pi and returned to Gucheng where they related what had happened.Zhang Fei wanted to go with them into the North of Yellow River, but Guan Yu opposed this, saying, ""Seeing you have this city, it makes a rallying point for us and a resting place. We must not abandon it lightly.Sun Qian and I will go; and while sway we look to you to keep the city safe.""""How can you go after killing the two generals, Yan Liang and Wen Chou?""""That will not stop me. And after I am there, I can act according to circumstances.""Then Guan Yu summoned Zhou Cang and asked him, saying, ""How many followers are there with Pei Yuanshao at Sleeping Bull Mountain?""""I should think four or five hundred.""""Now,"" said Guan Yu, ""I am going to take the shortest road to find my brother. Can you go to summon your army and lead them along the high road to assist me?"""
倉領命而去。關公與孫乾只帶二十餘騎投河北來。將至界首，乾曰：「將軍未可輕入，只在此間暫歇。待某先入見皇叔，別作商議。」關公依言，先打發孫乾去了。遙望前村有一所莊院，便與從人到彼投宿。莊內一老翁攜杖而出，與關公施禮。公具以實告。老翁曰：「某亦姓關，名定。久聞大名，幸得瞻謁。」遂命二子出見，款留關公，并從人俱留於莊內。,"With instructions to bring up this force, Zhou Cang left, while Guan Yu and Sun Qian and their small escort went off to the north.When they drew near the boundary, Sun Qian said, ""You must be careful how you go over. You ought to stop here while I go in, see Uncle Liu Bei, and take the necessary steps.""Seeing the wisdom of this, Guan Yu stopped there and sent his companion in advance. He and his followers going up to a nearby farm as an abiding place.When they got to the farm, out came a venerable man leaning on a staff. After exchanging salutes, Guan Yu told the old man all about himself.""My family name is also Guan, my personal name being Ding,"" said the old man. ""I know your reputation, and I am very happy to meet you.""Guan Ding sent for his two sons to come and make their bow. He put up Guan Yu in his house and provided for his escort in the farm buildings."
且說孫乾匹馬入冀州見玄德，具言前事。玄德曰：「簡雍亦在此間，可暗請來同議。」少頃，簡雍至，與孫乾相見畢，共議脫身之計。雍曰：「主公明日見袁紹，只說要往荊州，說劉表共破曹操，便可乘機而去。」玄德曰：「此計大妙！但公能隨我去否？」雍曰：「某亦自有脫身之計。」,"In the meantime Sun Qian had made his way to Jizhou City and told Liu Bei the whole story.Liu Bei said, ""Jian Yong is also here. We will send for him secretly to talk over this matter.""They did so; and when the usual salutes had been exchanged, they three began to consider the means of getting away.""My lord,"" said Jian Yong, ""you see Yuan Shao personally and say you wish to go to Jingzhou to see Liu Biao about a scheme for the destruction of Cao Cao. That will give an excuse.""""That seems best,"" said Liu Bei, ""but will you go with me?""""I have another plan to extricate myself,"" said Jian Yong."
商議已定。次日，玄德入見袁紹，告曰：「劉景升鎮守荊襄九郡，兵精糧足，宜與相約，共攻曹操。」紹曰：「吾嘗遣使約之，奈彼未肯相從。」玄德曰：「此人是備同宗，備往說，必無推阻。」紹曰：「若得劉表，勝劉辟多矣。」遂命玄德行。紹又曰：「近聞關雲長已離了曹操，欲來河北；吾當殺之，以雪顏良，文醜，之恨！」玄德曰：「明公前欲用之，吾故召之。今何又欲殺之耶？且顏良、文醜比之二鹿耳，雲長乃一虎也。失二鹿而得一虎，何恨之有？」紹笑曰：「吾固愛之，故戲言耳。公可再使人召之，令其速來。」玄德曰：「即遣孫乾往召之可也。」,"Having settled their plans, Liu Bei soon went in to see his protector and suggested, ""Liu Biao is strong and well posted. His help should be sought against our enemy.""""I have sent messengers repeatedly to ask his help,"" said Yuan Shao, ""but he is unwilling.""""As he and I are of the same family, he will not refuse me if I go and ask him,"" said Liu Bei.""Certainly he is worth much more than Liu Pi. You shall go.""""I have just heard,"" Yuan Shao continued, ""that Guan Yu has left Cao Cao and wants to come here. If he does, I will put him to death out of revenge for my two beloved generals —-Yan Liang and Wen Chou.""""Illustrious Sir, you wished to employ him and so I sent for him. Now you threaten to put him to death. The two men he slew were but deer compared with such a tiger as he is. When you exchange a couple of deer for a tiger, you need not complain of the bargain.""""Really I like him,"" said Yuan Shao. ""I was only joking. You can send another messenger for him and tell him to come soon.""""May I send Sun Qian for him?"""
紹大喜從之。玄德出，簡雍進曰：「玄德此去，必不回矣。某願與偕往；一則同說劉表，二則監住玄德。」紹然其言，便命簡雍與玄德同行。郭圖諫紹曰：「劉備前去說劉辟，未見成事；今又使與簡雍同往荊州，必不返矣。」紹曰：「汝勿多疑，簡雍自有見識。」郭圖嗟呀而出。,"""Certainly.""After Liu Bei had gone, Jian Yong came in and said to Yuan Shao, ""If Liu Bei goes, he will not come back. I had better go to speak to Liu Biao. And I can keep a watch on Liu Bei.""Yuan Shao agreed and issued orders for both to go.On the subject of the mission, Guo Tu came in to his chief to dissuade him.Said Guo Tu, ""Liu Bei went to speak to Liu Pi, but he accomplished nothing. Now you are sending Jian Yong with him, and I am sure neither will ever return.""""Do not be too suspicious,"" said Yuan Shao. ""Jian Yong is clever enough.""That was the end of the interview."
卻說玄德先命孫乾出城，問報關公；一面與簡雍辭了袁紹，上馬出城。行至界首，孫乾接著，同往關定莊上。關公迎門接拜，執手啼哭不止。關定領二子拜於草堂之前。玄德問其姓名。關公曰：「此人與弟同姓，有二子：長子關寧，學文；次子關平，學武。」關定曰：「今愚意欲遣次子跟隨關將軍，未識肯容納否？」玄德曰：「年幾何矣？」定曰：「十八歲矣。」玄德曰：「既蒙長者厚意，吾弟尚未有子，今即以賢郎為子，若何？」關定大喜，便命關平拜關公為父，呼玄德為伯父。玄德恐袁紹追之，急收拾起行。關平隨著關公，一齊起身。關定送了一程自回。關公教取路往臥牛山來。,"Forthwith Liu Bei sent Sun Qian back to Guan Yu and then, with Jian Yong, took leave of Yuan Shao and rode out of the city, As soon as they reached the border line, they met Sun Qian and all three rode off to Guan Ding's farm to meet Guan Yu. He came out to welcome them, bowed and then seized his brother's hands while tears streamed down his face.Presently the two sons of their host came to bow to the visitors. Liu Bei asked their names.""These are of the same name as myself,"" said Guan Yu. ""The sons are Guan Neng, who is a student, and Guan Ping, who is to be a soldier.""""I have been thinking of sending the younger in your train, General,"" said old Guan Ding, ""Would you take him?""""What is his age?"" said Liu Bei.""He is eighteen.""Liu Bei said, ""Since, O Senior, you are so kind, I venture to suggest that your son should be adopted by my brother, who has no son of his own. What think you of that?""Guan Ding was perfectly willing, so he called Guan Ping and bade him make a son's obeisance to Guan Yu and to style Liu Bei ""Uncle.""Then it was time to get on their way lest they should be pursued, and with Guan Yu went Guan Ping. Guan Ding and Guan Ning escorted them a long distance and then returned.The party took the road to Sleeping Bull Mountain."
正行間，忽見周倉引數十人帶傷而來。關公引他見了玄德。問其何故受傷，倉曰：「某未至臥牛山之前，先有一將單騎而來，與裴元紹交鋒，只一合，刺死裴元紹，盡數招降人伴，占住山寨。倉到彼招誘人伴時，止有這幾個過來，餘者俱懼怕，不敢擅離。倉不忿，與那將交戰，被他連勝數次，身中三槍；因此來報主公。」玄德曰：「此人怎生模樣？姓甚名誰？」倉曰：「極其雄壯，不知姓名。」,"Before they had gone very far, they met Zhou Cang with a small party. He was wounded. He was introduced to Liu Bei who asked him how it was.He replied, ""Before I reached the hill, a certain warrior all alone, had fought with my friend Pei Yuanshao and killed him. Then many of our troops surrendered to him, and he occupied our old camp. When I reached it, I tried to allure the soldiers back to my side but only succeeded with a few. The others were too afraid. I got angry and engaged the interloper, who however worsted me time after time and wounded me thrice.""""Who is the warrior? What does he look like?"" asked Liu Bei.""All I know he is a doughty fighter, I do not know his name."""
於是關公縱馬當先，玄德在後，逕投臥牛山來。周倉在山下叫罵，只見那將全副披挂，持槍驟馬，引眾下山。玄德早揮鞭出馬大叫曰：「來者莫非子龍否？」那將見了玄德，滾鞍下馬，拜伏道旁。原來果然是趙子龍。玄德，關公，俱下馬相見，問其何由至此。雲曰：「雲自別使君，不想公孫瓚不聽人言，以致兵敗自焚。袁紹屢次招雲。雲想紹亦非用人之人，因此未往。後欲至徐州投使君，又聞徐州失守，雲長已歸曹操，使君又在袁紹處。雲幾番欲來相投，只恐袁紹見怪。四海飄零，無容身之地。前偶過此處，適遇裴元紹下山來欲奪吾馬，雲因殺之，借此安身。近聞翼德在古城，欲往投之，未知真實。今幸得遇使君！」,"Thereafter they advanced toward the hill with Guan Yu in front and Liu Bei in rear. When they drew near, Zhou Cang began to abuse his enemy, who soon appeared, mailed and armed, coming down the hill like a tornado.Suddenly Liu Bei rode out waving his whip and shouting, ""O Zhao Zilong, I am here to look for you!""Indeed the rider was Zhao Zilong. He instantly slipped out of the saddle and bowed by the roadside.Liu Bei dismounted to talk with him and ask how he came to be there.""When I left you, I had no idea that Gongsun Zan was a man who would listen to no reason. The result was disaster, and he perished in the flames. Yuan Shao invited me to him several times, but I thought too little of him to go. Then I wanted to go to Xuzhou to you, but you had lost that place, and Guan Yu had gone over to Cao Cao, and you had joined Yuan Shao. Several times I thought of coming to you, but I feared Yuan Shao. So I drifted from one place to another with nowhere to rest till I happened to come this way, and Pei Yuanshao tried to steal my horse. So I slew him and took possession of his camp. I heard Zhang Fei was in Gucheng but thought it might be only a rumor. And so the days have passed till this happy meeting."""
玄德大喜，訴說從前之事。關公亦訴前事。玄德曰：「吾初見子龍，便有留戀不捨之情。今幸得相遇！」雲曰：「雲奔走四方，擇主而事，未有如使君者。今得相隨，大稱平生。雖肝腦塗地，無恨矣。」,"Liu Bei told Zhao Zilong all that had happened to him since they parted, and so did Guan Yu.Said Liu Bei, ""The first time I saw you, I felt drawn to you and did not want to part from you. I am very happy to meet you again.""""In all my wanderings, trying to find a lord worth serving, I have seen no one like you. Now I have reached your side, that is enough for all my life. I care not what may happen to me."""
當日就燒毀山寨，率領人眾，盡隨玄德前赴古城。張飛，糜竺，糜芳，迎接入城，各相拜訴。二夫人具言雲長之事，玄德感歎不已。於是殺牛宰馬，先拜謝天地，然後遍勞諸軍。玄德見兄弟重聚，將佐無缺，又新得了趙雲，關公又得了關平，周倉，二人，歡喜無限，連飲數日。後人有詩讚之曰：,"Next they burned the camp on Sleeping Bull Mountain, after which they all took the road back to Gucheng where they were welcomed. They exchanged the stories of their several adventures, and the two ladies related the valiant deeds of Guan Yu whereat Liu Bei was too affected to speak.Then they performed a great sacrifice to Heaven and Earth with the slaughter of a bull and a horse.The soldiers also were recompensed for their toils.Liu Bei surveyed the conditions around him and found therein much to rejoice at. His two brothers were restored to his side and none of his helpers were missing. Moreover he had gained Zhao Zilong, and Guan Yu had acquired an adopted son Guan Ping. Another commander had joined his ranks in the person of Zhou Cang. There was every occasion for feasting and gratification."
當時手足似瓜分，信斷音稀杳不聞。今日君臣重聚義，正如龍虎會風雲。時玄德，關，張，趙雲，孫乾，簡雍，糜竺，糜芳，關平，周倉，統領馬步軍校共四五千人。玄德欲棄了古城去守汝南，恰好劉辟，龔都，差人來請。於是遂起軍往汝南駐紮，招軍買馬，徐圖征進，不在話下。,"Scattered wide were the brothers, none knew another's retreat,Joyfully now they foregather, dragon and tigers meet.At this time the forces under the command of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Zilong, Sun Qian, Jian Yong, Mi Zhu, Mi Fang, Guan Ping, and Zhou Cang numbered four or five thousand soldiers. Liu Bei was in favor of leaving Gucheng and occupying Runan, and just then Liu Pi and Gong Du, the commanders of that city, sent to invite him to go there. So they went. There they devoted all their efforts to strengthen their army, both horse and foot."
且說袁紹見玄德不回，大怒，欲起兵伐之。郭圖曰：「劉備不足慮。曹操乃勁敵也，不可不除。劉表雖據荊州，不足為強。江東孫伯符威鎮三江，地連六郡，謀臣武士極多，可使人結之，共攻曹操。」紹從其言，即修書遣陳震為使，來會孫策。正是：只因河北英雄去，引出江東豪傑來。未知其事如何，且看下文分解。,"Yuan Shao was much annoyed when Liu Bei did not return and at first was for sending a force after him. However Guo Tu dissuaded him.""Liu Bei needs cause you no anxiety. Cao Cao is your one enemy and must be destroyed. Even Liu Biao, though strongly posted on River Han, is none too terrible. There is Sun Ce on the southeast of the Great River, strong, feared, with wide domain of six territories, a large army, and able counselors and leaders; you should make an alliance there against Cao Cao.""Guo Tu won his chief to his view and wrote to Sun Ce, sending the letter by Chen Zhen.Just as one warrior leaves the north,Another from the east comes forth.Future chapters will reveal the outcome of these dispositions."
