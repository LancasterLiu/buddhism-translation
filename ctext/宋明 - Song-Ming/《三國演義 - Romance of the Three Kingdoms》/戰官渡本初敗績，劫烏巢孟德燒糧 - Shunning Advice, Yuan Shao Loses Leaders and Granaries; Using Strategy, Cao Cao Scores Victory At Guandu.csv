卻說袁紹興兵，望官渡進發。夏侯惇發書告急。曹操起軍七萬，前往迎敵，留荀彧守許都。紹兵臨發，田豐從獄中上書諫曰：「今且宜靜守以待天時，不可妄興大兵，恐有不利。」逢紀譖曰：「主公興仁義之師，田豐何得出此不祥之語？」,"Hearing that Yuan Shao was hastening to attack at Guandu, Xiahou Dun wrote to the capital urgently asking for reinforcements, and Cao Cao told off seventy thousand troops with which he marched. Xun Yu was left to guard the capital.Just as Yuan Shao's army was starting, Tian Feng sent out a remonstrance from his prison cell, saying, ""My lord, a hasty attack in full scale will bring disaster to our army. It is best now to wait upon such times as Heaven should appoint.""Peng Ji said to Yuan Shao, ""Why does this Tian Feng utter ill-omened words? My lord is sending forth an army in the cause of humanity and justice."""
紹因怒，欲斬田豐。眾官告免。紹恨曰：「待吾破了曹操，明正其罪！」遂催軍進發。旌旗遍野，刀劍如林。行至陽武，下定寨柵。沮授曰：「我軍雖眾，而勇猛不及彼軍；彼軍雖精，而糧草不如我軍。彼軍無糧，利在急戰；我軍有糧，宜且緩守。若能曠以日月，則彼軍不戰自敗矣。」紹怒曰：「田豐慢我軍心，吾回日必斬之。汝安敢又如此！」──叱左右將沮授鎖禁軍中。──「待我破曹之後，與田豐一體治罪！」,"Easily moved to anger, Yuan Shao was going to execute Tian Feng, but this time he forbore at the entreaties of many of his officers.However, he was not appeased, for he said, ""I will punish Tian Feng when I return from conquering Cao Cao.""Meanwhile Yuan Shao hastened to start. The banners of his host filled the horizon, their swords were as trees in the forest. They marched to Yangwu and there made a strong camp.Then Ju Shou once more opposed any hasty movement, saying, ""Though our soldiers are many, they are not so bold as the enemy. However, veterans as are the enemy, they have not ample supplies. Therefore they will wish to force on a speedy battle, while our policy is to hold them off and delay. If we can keep from a decisive battle long enough, the victory will be ours without fighting.""This advice did not appeal to Yuan Shao.Said he, threateningly, ""Tian Feng spoke discouraging words to my armies, and I will assuredly put him to death on my return. How dare you follow in the same way?""Yuan Shao summoned the lictors and sent away the adviser in chains, saying, ""When I have overcome Cao Cao, then will I deal with you and Tian Feng together!"""
於是下令，將大軍七十萬，東西南北，週圍安營，連絡九十餘里。細作探知虛實，報至官渡。曹軍新到，聞之皆懼。曹操與眾謀士商議。荀攸曰：「紹軍雖多，不足懼也。我軍俱精銳之士，無不一以當十。但利在急戰。若遷延日月，糧草不敷，事可憂矣。」操曰：「所言正合吾意。」遂傳令軍將鼓譟而進。紹軍來迎，兩邊排成陣勢。審配撥弩手一萬，伏於兩翼；弓箭手五千，伏於門旗內，約響齊發。,"The huge army was camped in four divisions, one toward each point of the compass. The camps were thirty miles in circuit. Scouts and spies were sent out to discover the strong and the weak points of the enemy.Cao Cao's army arrived and were smitten with fear when they heard of the strength of their enemy. The leader called together his council.Then said Adviser Xun You, ""The enemy are many but not terrible. Ours is an army of veterans, every soldier of ours worth ten of theirs. But our advantage lies in a speedy battle, for unhappily our stores are insufficient for a long campaign.""""You speak to the point,"" said Cao Cao. ""I think the same.""Therefore Cao Cao issued orders to press noisily forward and force on a battle. Yuan Shao's soldiers took up the challenge, and the two sides were arrayed. On Yuan Shao's side, Shen Pei placed ten thousand of crossbowmen in ambush on the two wings, while five thousand of archers held the center. The signal for general attack was a bomb."
三通鼓罷，袁紹金盔金甲，錦袍玉帶，立馬陣前。左右排列著張郃、高覽、韓猛、淳于瓊等諸將。旌旗節鉞，甚是嚴整。曹陣上門旗開處，曹操出馬。許褚、張遼、徐晃、李典等，各持兵器，前後擁衛。曹操以鞭指袁紹曰：「吾於天子之前，保奏你為大將軍；今何故謀反？」紹怒曰：「汝託名漢相，實為漢賊！罪惡彌天，甚於莽、卓，乃反誣人造反耶！」操曰：「吾今奉詔討汝！」紹曰：「吾奉衣帶詔討賊！」,"The onset was to continue through three rolls of the drum. Yuan Shao wore a silver helmet and breastplate and an embroidered robe held in by a jeweled belt. He took up his post in the center with his commanders —-Gao Lan, Zhang He, Han Meng, Chunyu Qiong, and others —-ranged right and left. His banners and ensigns made a brave show.When Cao Cao's army's center opened and the banners moved aside, the chieftain appeared on horseback with his staff of doughty leaders all fully armed —-Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Xu Huang, Li Dian, and others.Pointing with his whip at Yuan Shao, Cao Cao cried, ""In the presence of the Emperor, I pressed your claims to consideration and obtained for you the title of Regent Marshal. Why do you now plan rebellion?""Yuan Shao replied, ""You take the title of a minister of Han, but you are really a rebel against the House. Your crimes and evil deeds reach to the heavens, and you are worse than the usurper Wang Mang and the rebel Dong Zhuo. What are these slanderous words about rebellion that dare you address to me?""""I have a command to make you prisoner!""""I have the Girdle Decree to arrest rebels!"" replied Yuan Shao."
操怒，使張遼出戰。張郃躍馬來迎。二將鬥了四五十合，不分勝負。曹操見了，暗暗稱奇。許褚揮刀縱馬，直出助戰。高覽挺槍接住。四員將捉對兒廝殺。曹操令夏侯惇、曹洪，各引三千軍，齊衝彼陣。審配見曹軍來衝陣，便令放起號砲。兩下萬弩並發，中車內弓箭手一齊擁出陣前亂射。曹軍如何抵敵，望南急走。袁紹驅兵掩殺，曹軍大敗，盡退至官渡。袁紹移軍逼近官渡下寨。審配曰：「今可撥兵十萬守官渡，就曹操寨前築起土山，令軍人下視寨中放箭。操若棄此而去，吾得此隘口，許昌可破矣。」,"Then Cao Cao became wrathful and bade Zhang Liao ride forth as his champion. From the other side rode Zhang He on a curvetting steed. The two champions fought forty or fifty bouts with no advantage to either. In his heart Cao Cao thought the contest amazing. Then Xu Chu whirled up his sword and went to help. From the other side, to match him rode out Gao Lan with his spear set, and the contestants were now four, battling two and two. Then Cao Cao ordered three thousand troops under Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong to attack the opponents' array. Thereupon on Yuan Shao's side, Shen Pei gave the signal for attack, and the legion of crossbowmen on the wings shot and the center archers let fly all together. The arrows flew all over the field in front, and Cao Cao's troops could not advance. They hastened away toward the south. Yuan Shao threw his soldiers on their rear, and they were broken. They fled away toward Guandu, and Yuan Shao advanced another stage. He camped near them.Then Shen Pei said, ""Now send one hundred thousand soldiers to guard Guandu, and get near Cao Cao's camp. Then build up observation mounds to get a clear view of the enemy, and choose vantage points whence to shoot arrows into the midst of their host. If we can force him to evacuate this place, we shall have gained a strategic point whence Capital Xuchang can be attacked."""
紹從之，於各寨內選精壯軍人，用鐵鍬土擔，齊來曹操寨邊，壘土成山。曹營內見袁軍堆築土山，欲待出去衝突，被審配弓弩手當住咽喉要路，不能前進。十日之內，築成土山五十餘座，上立高櫓，分撥弓弩手於其上射箭。曹軍大懼，皆頂著遮箭牌守禦。土山上一聲梆子響處，箭下如雨。曹軍皆蒙楯伏地，袁軍吶喊而笑。曹操見軍慌亂，集眾謀士問計。劉曄進曰：「可作發石車以破之。」操令曄進車式，連夜造發石車數百乘，分布營牆內，正對著土山上雲梯。候弓箭手射箭時，營內一齊拽動石車，砲石飛空，往上亂打。人無躲處，弓箭手死者無數。袁軍皆號其車為「霹靂車」。,"Yuan Shao adopted this suggestion. From each of the camps, they sought out the strongest veterans who dug with iron spades and carried earth to raise mounds near Cao Cao's camp.Cao Cao's soldiers saw what their enemies were doing and were anxious to make a sortie and drive them off. But the archers and crossbowmen came out commanding the narrow throat through which it was necessary to attack and stayed them. At the end of ten days, they had build up more than half a hundred mounds, and on the summit of each was a lofty tower, whence the archers could command their opponents' camp. Cao Cao's soldiers were greatly frightened and held up their bucklers to keep off the various missiles. From the mounds the arrows flew down like a fierce rain after each roll of drums. The soldiers of Yuan Shao's army laughed and jeered when they saw their enemies crouching under their shields and crawling on the ground to avoid their missiles.Cao Cao saw that his troops were getting out of hand under this attack, so he called a council.Liu Ye spoke up, saying, ""Let us make catapults and so destroy them.""Cao Cao at once had models brought and set cunning workers to make these stone-throwing machines. They soon constructed some hundreds and placed them along the walls of the camp inside, just opposite the high ladders on the enemy's mounds.Then Cao Cao's troops watched for Yuan Shao's archers to ascend the towers. As soon as the archers began to shoot, all the catapults began to heave stone balls into the skies and they wrought great havoc. There was no shelter from the falling stones, and enormous numbers of the archers were killed. Yuan Shao's troops called these machines ""Rumblers""."
由是袁軍不敢登高射箭。審配又獻一計：令軍人用鐵暗打地道，直透曹營內，號為「掘子軍」。曹兵望見袁軍於山後掘土坑，報知曹操。操又問計於劉曄。曄曰：「此袁軍不能攻明而攻暗，發掘伏道，欲從地下透營而入耳。」操曰：「何以禦之？」曄曰：「可遶營掘長塹，則彼伏道無用也。」操連夜差軍掘塹。袁軍掘伏道到塹邊，果不能入，空費軍力。,"Because of this, the archers dared not ascend the mounds to shoot. Then Shen Pei, the strategist, thought out another plan. He set troops to tunnel under the walls into the midst of Cao Cao's camp and called this corps ""The Sappers"". Cao Cao's soldiers saw the enemy digging out pits behind the mounds and told the chief, who at once sought a counter plan from Liu Ye.""As Yuan Shao can no longer attack openly, he is attacking secretly and is tunneling a road under ground into the midst of our camp,"" said Liu Ye.""But how to meet it?""""We can surround the camp with a deep moat which renders their tunnel useless.""So a deep moat was dug as quickly as possible, and when the enemy sappers arrived thereat, lo! their labor had been in vain and the sap was useless."
卻說曹操守官渡，自八月起，至九月終，軍力漸乏，糧草不繼，意欲棄官渡退回許昌；遲疑未決，乃作書遣人赴許昌問荀彧。彧以書報之。書略曰：,"Cao Cao held Guandu throughout the eighth and ninth months when, his army being worn out and provisions failing, he began to think of giving up and returning to the capital. As he could not make up his mind, he referred his difficulties by letter to Xun Yu, whom he had left to guard Xuchang. The reply he got was to this effect:"
承尊命使決進退之疑，愚以袁紹悉眾聚於官渡，欲與明公決勝負，公以至弱當至強，若不能制，必為所乘；是天下之大機也。紹軍雖眾，而不能用；以公之神武明哲，何向而不濟？今軍實雖少，未若楚、漢在滎陽、成皋也。公今畫地而守，扼其喉而使不能進，情見勢竭，必將有變。此用奇之時，斷不可失。惟明公裁察焉。,"""I have received your command to decide whether to continue the campaign or retire. It appears to me that Yuan Shao assembled such large forces at Guandu with the expectation of winning a decision. You, Sir, are very weak while he is very strong. If you cannot get the better of him, he will be able to work his will on you, and this will be a crisis of the empire. Your opponents are indeed numerous, but their leader knows not how to use them. With your military genius and discernment, where are you not sure to succeed? Now though your numbers are small, your situation is still brighter than Liu Bang's when he faced against Xiang Yu in Jungyang and Chenggao. You are securely entrenched with your hands on Yuan Shao's throat; and even if you cannot advance, that state of things cannot endure forever but must change. This is the time to play some unexpected move, and you must not miss it. The device I leave to your illustrious ingenuity."""
曹操得書大喜，令將士效力死守。紹軍約退三十餘里，操遣將出營巡哨。有徐晃部將史渙獲得袁軍細作，解見徐晃。晃問其軍中虛實。答曰：「早晚大將韓猛運糧至軍前接濟，先令我等探路。」徐晃便將此事報知曹操。荀攸曰：「韓猛匹夫之勇耳。若遣一人引輕騎數千，從半路擊之，斷其糧草，紹軍自亂。」操曰：「誰人可往？」攸曰：「即遣徐晃可也。」,"This letter greatly pleased Cao Cao, and he urged upon his troops to use every effort to maintain the position.Yuan Shao then retired some ten miles, and Cao Cao sent out scouts to ascertain his new dispositions. One of Xu Huang's officers, Shi Huan, captured an enemy spy and sent him to his chief. Xu Huang interrogated him and found out that a convoy of supplies was expected and that this spy and others had been sent to find out what the risks of the route were. Xu Huang went at once to tell Cao Cao.When Xun You heard that the commander of the convoy was Han Meng, he said, ""That fellow is a valiant fool. A few thousand light horse sent to intercept him can capture the whole train and cause much trouble in the enemy's camp.""""Whom should I send?"" asked Cao Cao.""You might send Xu Huang. He is capable of such a task."""
操遂差徐晃帶將史渙并所部兵先出，後使張遼、許褚引兵救應。當夜韓猛押糧車數千輛，解赴紹寨。正走之間，山谷內徐晃、史渙引軍截住去路，韓猛飛馬來戰。徐晃接住廝殺，史渙便殺散人夫，放火焚燒糧車。韓猛抵當不住，撥馬回走。徐晃催軍燒盡輜量。袁紹軍中，望見西北上火起，正驚疑間，敗軍報來：「糧草被劫。」,"So Xu Huang was deputed, and he took with him Shi Huan, who had captured the spy, and his company. And this party was supported by Zhang Liao and Xu Chu.It was night when the commissariat train of many thousands of wagons drew near Yuan Shao's camp. As they passed through a defile, Xu Huang and Shi Huan came out and stopped the train. Han Meng galloped up to give battle but was soon overcome. The guard was scattered, and soon the whole train was in flames. The escort and their leader fled away.The glow of the flames seen from Yuan Shao's camp caused great consternation, which became fear when the escaped soldiers rode in and told their tale."
紹急遣張郃、高覽去截大路，正遇徐晃燒糧而回。恰欲交鋒，背後張遼、許褚軍到。兩下夾攻，殺散袁軍，四將合兵一處，回官渡寨中。曹操大喜，重加賞勞；又分軍於寨前結營，為犄角之勢。,"Yuan Shao sent out Zhang He and Gao Lan to try to intercept the raiders, and they came upon Xu Huang and his company. Just as Zhang He and Gao Lan were attacking, reinforcements from Zhang Liao and Xu Chu came up, and the Yuan Shao's troops were between two fires. They were cut to pieces and the successful generals of Cao Cao rode back to Guandu, where they were richly rewarded.As an additional safeguard, Cao Cao made a supporting outpost in front of the main camp to be the apex of a triangle of defense."
卻說韓猛敗軍還營，紹大怒，欲斬韓猛，眾官勸免。審配曰：「行軍以糧食為重，不可不用心隄防。烏巢乃屯糧之處，必得重兵守之。」袁紹曰：「吾籌策已定，汝可回鄴都監督糧草，休教缺乏。」審配領命而去。袁紹遣大將淳于瓊，督領部將眭元進、韓莒子、呂威璜、趙叡等，引二萬人馬，守烏巢。那淳于瓊性剛好酒，軍士多畏之；既至烏巢，終日與諸將聚飲。,"When Han Meng returned with his woeful tidings, Yuan Shao was angry and threatened to put him to death. His colleagues begged him off.Then said Shen Pei, ""Food is very important for an army in the field and must be defended with the greatest diligence. Wuchao is our main depot and must be carefully guarded.""""My plans being complete,"" said Yuan Shao. ""You may as well return to Capital Yejun of Jizhou and undertake the control of the supplies. Let there be no shortage.""So Shen Pei left the army. Then a force of twenty thousand troops was told off to defend the depot in Wuchao. The leaders of this body were Chunyu Qiong, Gui Yuanjin, Han Juzi, Lu Weihuang, and Zhao Rui.Of these generals, Chunyu Qiong was a hard man and a heavy drinker, who in his cups was a terror to the soldiers. Under the idle life of guarding the supply depot, the leaders gave themselves up to indulgence and drank heavily."
且說曹操軍糧告竭，急發使往許昌教荀彧作速措辦糧草，星夜解赴軍前接濟。使者齎書而往；行不上三十里，被袁軍捉住，縛見謀士許攸。那許攸字子遠，少時曾與曹操為友，此時卻在袁紹處為謀士。當下搜得使者所齎曹操催糧書信，逕來見紹曰：「曹操屯軍官渡，與我相持已久，許昌必空虛；若分一軍星夜掩襲許昌，則許昌可拔，而曹操可擒也。今操糧草已盡，正可乘此機會，兩路擊之。」紹曰：「曹操詭計極多，此書乃誘敵之計也。」攸曰：「今若不取，後將反受其害。」,"In Cao Cao's army food was also getting scarce, and a message was sent to Capital Xuchang to send grain quickly. The messenger with the letter, however, had not gone far when he fell into the hands of Yuan Shao's guards, who took him to the adviser Xu You.Seeing from the letter that Cao Cao was short of supplies, Xu You went to Yuan Shao and told him, saying, ""Cao Cao and we have been at grips here for a long time, and Capital Xuchang must be undefended. A small army sent quickly could take it, and at the same moment an attack here would deliver Cao Cao into our hands. Now is the moment to strike, for his supplies are short.""Yuan Shao replied, ""Cao Cao is full of ruses, and this letter is artfully designed to bring about a battle to suit himself.""""If you do not take this chance, he will do you some injury by and by."""
正話間，忽有使者自鄴郡來，呈上審配書。書中先說運糧事；後言許攸在冀州時，嘗濫受民間財物，且縱令子姪輩多科稅錢糧入己，今已收其子姪下獄矣。紹見書大怒曰：「濫行匹夫！尚有面目於吾前獻計耶！汝與曹操有舊，想今亦受他財賄，為他作奸細，啜賺吾軍耳！本當斬首，今權且寄頭在項！可速退出，今後不許相見！」,"Just at this juncture in came a dispatch from Yejun in which, after some details regarding the forwarding of grain, Shen Pei said he had discovered that Xu You had been in the habit of receiving bribes while in Jizhou and had winked at his relatives collecting excess taxes. One of his son and nephew were then in prison. At this Yuan Shao turned on Xu You angrily and said, ""How can you have the face to stand before me and propose plans, you extortionate fellow? You and Cao Cao have old liking for each other, and he has bribed you to do his dirty work for him and help his base schemes. Now you want to betray my army. I ought to take off your head, but temporarily I will let your neck carry it away. Get out and never let me see you again."""
許攸出，仰天歎曰：「『忠言逆耳』，『豎子不足與謀！』吾子姪已遭審配之害，吾何顏復見冀州之人乎！」遂欲拔劍自刎。左右奪劍勸曰：「公何輕生至此？袁紹不納直言，後必為曹操所擒。公既與曹公有舊，何不棄暗投明？」只這兩句言語，點醒許攸；於是許攸逕投。後人有詩歎曰：,"The discredited adviser sighed and went out, saying, ""Faithful words offend his ear. He is a pest and unworthy of advice from me. And now that Shen Pei has injured my son and nephew, how can I look my fellow folks in the face again?""And Xu You drew his sword to end his life. But his people prevented that.They said, ""If Yuan Shao rejects your honest words, then assuredly he will be taken by Cao Cao. You are an old friend of Cao Cao's: Why not abandon the shade for the sunlight?""Just these few words awakened Xu You to consciousness of his position, and he decided to leave Yuan Shao and go over to Cao Cao for he was an old friend."
本初豪氣蓋中華，官渡相持枉歎嗟。若使許攸謀見用，山河豈得屬曹家？,"Vainly now for chances lostYuan Shao sighs; once he was great.Had he taken Xu You's advice,Cao Cao had not set up a state."
卻說許攸暗步出營，逕投曹寨，伏路軍人拿住。攸曰：「我是曹丞相故友，快與我通報，說南陽許攸來見。」軍士忙報入寨中。時操方解衣歇息，聞說許攸私奔到寨，大喜，不及穿履，跣足出迎。遙見許攸，撫掌歡笑，攜手共入，操先拜於地。攸慌扶起曰：「公乃漢相，吾乃布衣，何謙恭如此？」操曰：「公乃操故友，豈敢以名爵相上下乎！」攸曰：「某不能擇主，屈身袁紹，言不聽，計不從，今特棄之來見故人。願賜收錄。」操曰：「子遠肯來，吾事濟矣。願即教我以破紹之計。」攸曰：「吾曾教袁紹以輕騎乘掩許都，首尾相攻。」操大驚曰：「若袁紹用子言，吾事敗矣。」攸曰：「公今軍糧尚有幾何？」操曰：「可支一年。」攸笑曰：「恐未必。」操曰：「有半年耳。」,"Xu You stealthily left the camp and set out for Cao Cao's lines. He was captured on the way. He told his captors: ""I am an old friend of the Prime Minister. Go and tell the Prime Minister that Xu You of Nanyang wishes to see him.""They did so. Cao Cao was resting in his tent, his clothing loose and comfortable after the toils of the day. When he heard who wished to see him, he arose quite joyfully and hastily ran out, on bare feet, to receive Xu You. Cao Cao went forth to greet him. They saw each other in the distance, and Cao Cao clapped his hands with gladness, bowing to the ground when near enough to his visitor.Xu You hastened to help him rise, saying, ""Sir, you, a great minister, should not thus salute a simple civilian like me.""""But you are my old friend, and no name or office makes any difference to us,"" replied Cao Cao.""Having been unable to choose the lord I would serve, I bowed my head before Yuan Shao wishing to support him sincerely. But he was deaf to my words and disregarded my plans. Wherefore I have left him and come now to see my old friend from whom I hope employment.""""If you are willing to come, then have I indeed a helper,"" said Cao Cao. ""I desire you to give me a scheme for the destruction of Yuan Shao.""""I counseled him to send a light force to take Capital Xuchang and at the same time attack here in full scale so that head and tail be both attacked.""Cao Cao was alarmed, saying, ""If he does so, I am lost!""""How much grain have you in store?"" said the new adviser.""Enough for a year.""""I think not quite,"" said Xu You, smiling.""Well, half a year."""
攸拂袖而起，趨步出帳曰：「吾以誠相投，而公見欺如是，豈吾所望哉！」操挽留曰：「子遠勿嗔，尚容實訴。軍中糧實可支三月耳。」攸笑曰：「世人皆言孟德奸雄，今果然也。」操亦笑曰：「豈不聞兵不厭詐？」遂附耳低言曰：「軍中止有此月之糧。」攸大聲曰：「休瞞我，糧已盡矣！」操愕然曰：「何以知之？」攸乃出操與荀彧之書以示之曰：「此書何人所寫？」操驚問曰：「何處得之？」攸以獲使之事相告。操執其手曰：「子遠既念舊交而來，願即有以教我。」攸曰：「明公以孤軍抗大敵，而不求急勝之方，此取死之道也。攸有一策，不過三日，使袁紹百萬之眾，不戰自破。明公還肯聽否？」操喜曰：「願聞良策。」攸曰：「袁紹軍糧輜重，盡積烏巢，今撥淳于瓊把守。瓊嗜酒無備；公可選精兵詐稱袁將蔣奇領兵到彼護糧，乘間燒其糧草輜重，則紹軍不三日將自亂矣。」操大喜，重待許攸，留於寨中。,"The visitor shook out his sleeves, rose and hurried toward the door of the tent, saying, ""I offer him good counsel, and he repays me with deceit. Could I have expected it?""Cao Cao held him back.""Do not be angry,"" said he. ""I will tell you the truth. Really I have here only enough for three months.""""Everybody says you are a marvel of wickedness, and indeed it is true,"" said Xu You.""But who does not know that in war there is no objection to deceit?"" replied Cao Cao.Then whispering in Xu You's ear, he said, ""Actually here I have only supplies for this month's use.""""O do not throw dust in my eyes any more. Your grain is exhausted and I know it.""Cao Cao was startled, for he thought no one knew of the straits he was in.""How did you find that out?"" said Cao Cao.Xu You produced the captured letter, saying, ""Who wrote that?""""Where did you get it?""Whereupon Xu You told Cao Cao the story of the captured messenger.Cao Cao seized him by the hand, saying, ""Since our old friendship has brought you to me, I hope you have some plan to suggest to me.""Xu You said, ""To oppose a great army with a small one is to walk in the way of destruction, unless you inflict quick defeat. I can propose a plan which will defeat the innumerable hordes of Yuan Shao without fighting a battle. But will you follow my advice?""""I very much desire to know your plan,"" said Cao Cao.""Your enemy's stores of all kinds are at Wuchao, where the Commander of the Guard is that drunkard Chunyu Qiong. You can send some of your trusty veterans to pretend they belong to one of Yuan Shao's generals, Jiang Qi, sent to help guard the depot. These soldiers can find an opportunity to fire the grain and stores of all kinds, which will upset all Yuan Shao's calculations. In three days Yuan Shao is no more.""Cao Cao greatly approved. He treated Xu You very liberally and kept him in his camp."
次日，操自選馬步軍士五千，準備往烏巢劫糧。張遼曰：「袁紹屯糧之所，安得無備？丞相未可輕往。恐許攸有詐。」操曰：「不然。許攸此來，天敗袁紹。今吾軍糧不給，難以久持；若不用許攸之計，是坐而待困也。彼若有詐，安肯留我寨中？且吾亦欲劫寨久矣。今劫糧之舉，計在必行，君請勿疑。」遼曰：「亦須防袁紹乘虛來襲。」操笑曰：「吾已籌之熟矣。」便教荀攸、賈詡、曹洪同許攸守大寨，夏侯惇、夏侯淵領一軍伏於左，曹仁、李典領一軍伏於右，以備不虞。教張遼、許褚在前，徐晃、于禁在後，操自引諸將居中，共五千人馬，打著袁軍旗號，軍士皆束草負薪，人銜枚，馬勒口，黃昏時分，望烏巢進發。是夜星光滿天。,"Forthwith he chose five thousand of horse and foot ready for the expedition.Zhang Liao protested, saying, ""The enterprise will be futile as the grain depot will certainly be well guarded. Without caution, we may be victims of the treachery on the part of the newly arrived Xu You.""""Xu You is no traitor,"" said Cao Cao. ""He has come sent by Heaven to defeat Yuan Shao. If we do not get grain, it will be hard to hold out. I have to either follow his advice or sit still and be hemmed in. If he were a traitor, he would hardly remain in my camp. Moreover this raid has been my desire for a long time. Have no doubts: The raid will certainly succeed.""""Well, then, you must look out for an attack here while the camp is undefended.""""That is already well provided for,"" said Cao Cao gleefully.The arrangements for the raid on the grain depot were made with extreme care to ensure success. Cao Cao assigned Xun You, Jia Xu, and Cao Hong to guard the main camp, together with Xu You; Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan to guard the left camp; Cao Ren and Li Dian to guard the right camp. When all was ready they set out, Cao Cao himself in the center, with Zhang Liao and Xu Chu as van leaders and Xu Huang and Yu Jin as rear guard. The army showed the ensigns of their opponents. The troops carried bundles of grass and faggots to make a blaze. The soldiers were gagged and the horses tied round the muzzles so as to prevent any noise. They set out at dusk.The night was fine and the stars shone brightly."
且說沮授被袁紹拘禁在軍中，是夜因見眾星朗列，乃命監者引出中庭，仰觀天象。忽見太白逆行，侵犯牛、斗之分，大驚曰：「禍將至矣！」遂連夜求見袁紹。時紹已醉臥，聽說沮授有密事啟報，喚入問之。授曰：「適觀天象，見太白逆行於柳、鬼之間，流光射入牛、斗之分，恐有賊兵劫掠之害。烏巢屯糧之所，不可不提備。宜速遣精兵猛將，於間道山路巡哨，免為曹操所算。」紹怒叱曰：「汝乃得罪之人，何敢妄言惑眾！」因叱監者曰：「吾令汝拘囚之，何敢放出！」遂命斬監者，別喚人監押沮授。授出，掩淚歎曰：「我軍亡在旦夕，我屍骸不知落於何處也！」後人有詩歎曰：,"Ju Shou, still a prisoner in Yuan Shao's camp, saw the stars were very brilliant and told his gaolers to conduct him out to the central pavilion whence he could study them. While watching he saw the planet Venus invade the quarter of the Bear and Lyra, which startled him very greatly.""Some misfortune is near!"" said Ju Shou.So although it was still night, he went to see his master. But Yuan Shao was sleeping after indulgence in too much wine and was in bad humor. However, when they had roused him saying that the prisoner had a secret message to deliver, he got up.""While I happened to be studying the aspect of the heavens,"" said the night visitor, ""I saw Venus, then between Hydra and Cancer, suddenly shoot into the neighborhood of the Bear and Lyra. There is danger of a robber raid, and special precautions must be taken at the grain depot. Lose no time in sending good soldiers and vigorous leaders thither, and keep a lookout on the byways among the hills that you may escape the wiles of Cao Cao.""""You are a criminal!"" said Yuan Shao. ""How dare you come with such wild nonsense to upset my armies.""And turning to the gaolers Yuan Shao continued, ""I bade you confine him. Why did you let him come?""Then he issued orders to put the gaolers to death and appointed others to keep the prisoner in close custody.Ju Shou went away, wiping his falling tears and sighing deeply, ""Our soldiers' destruction is at hand, and I know not where our poor corpses may find a resting place."""
逆耳忠言反見仇，獨夫袁紹少機謀；烏巢糧盡根基拔，猶欲區區守冀州。,"Blunt truth offended Yuan Shao,Too stupid any plan to make,His stores destroyed this is evidentThat Jizhou also is at stake.Cao Cao's raiding party went along through the night. Passing one of Yuan Shao's outpost camps, they were challenged."
卻說曹操領兵夜行，前過袁紹別寨，寨兵問是何處軍馬。操使人應曰：「蔣奇奉命往烏巢護糧。」袁軍見是自家旗號，遂不疑惑。凡過數處，皆詐稱蔣奇之兵，並無阻礙。及到烏巢，四更已盡。操教軍士將束草周圍舉火，眾將校鼓譟直入。時淳于瓊方與眾將飲了酒，醉臥帳中；聞鼓譟之聲，連忙跳起問：「何故喧鬧？」言未已，早被撓釣拖翻。眭元進、趙叡運糧方回，見屯上火起，急來救應。曹軍飛報曹操，說：「賊兵在後，請分軍拒之。」操大喝曰：「諸將只顧奮力向前，待賊至背後，方可回戰！」於是眾軍將無不爭先掩殺。一霎時，火燄四起，煙迷太空。眭、趙二將驅兵來救，操勒馬回戰。二將抵敵不住，皆被曹軍所殺，糧草盡行燒絕。淳于瓊被擒見操，操命割去其耳鼻手指，縛於馬上，放回紹營以辱之。,"Cao Cao sent forward a man to say, ""Jiang Qi has orders to go to Wuchao to guard the grain stores.""Seeing that the raiders marched under the ensigns of Yuan Shao, the guard had no suspicions and let them pass. At every post this ruse was effective, and they got safely through. They reached their objective at the end of the fourth watch, the straw and wood were placed in position without loss of time, and the blaze started. Then Cao Cao's commanders beat to attack.At this time Chunyu Qiong and his companions were all asleep after a heavy drinking bout. However, when the alarm was given, they sprang up and asked what was the matter. The hubbub was indescribable. Very soon the fuddled officers were caught with hooks and hauled out of their camp.Yuan Shao's generals Gui Yuanjin and Zhao Rui were just returning from taking grain to the camp and seeing the flames arise, they hastened to assist.Some of Cao Cao's soldiers ran to him, saying, ""The enemy is coming up in the rear. Send reinforcements.""But Cao Cao only replied, ""Press on to the front till the enemy is actually close at hand and then face about.""So the attack was pressed on and they all hastened forward. Very soon the fire gained strength, and thick smoke hung all around filling the sky. When Gui Yuanjin and Zhao Rui drew near, Cao Cao turned about and attacked them. They could not stand this for a moment, and both generals were killed. Finally the stores of grain and forage were utterly destroyed.The commander, Chunyu Qiong, was made prisoner and taken to Cao Cao who ordered him to be deprived of ears, nose, and hands. He was bound on a horse and sent, thus horribly mutilated, to his master."
卻說袁紹在帳中，聞報正北上火光滿天，知是烏巢有失，急出帳召文武，各官商議遣兵往救。張郃曰：「某與高覽同往救之。」郭圖曰：「不可。曹軍劫糧，曹操必然親往；操既自出，寨必虛空，可縱兵先擊曹操之寨；操聞之，必速還：此孫臏『圍魏救趙』之計也。」張郃曰：「非也。曹操多謀，外出必為內備，以防不虞。今若攻操營而不拔，瓊等見獲，吾屬皆被擒矣。」郭圖曰：「曹操只顧劫糧，豈留兵在寨耶？」再三請劫曹營。紹乃遣張郃、高覽引軍五千，往官渡擊曹營；遣蔣奇領兵一萬，往救烏巢。,"From Yuan Shao's camp, the flames of the burning depot were seen away in the north, and they knew what they meant. Yuan Shao hastily summoned his officers to a council to send a rescue party.Zhang He offered to go with Gao Lan, but Guo Tu said, ""You may not go. It is certain that Cao Cao is there in person, wherefore his camp is undefended. Let loose our soldiers on the camp, and that will speedily bring Cao Cao back again. This is how Sun Bin besieged Wei and thereby rescued Zhao.""But Zhang He said, ""Not so; Cao Cao is too wily not to have fully prepared against a chance attack. If we attack his camp and fail and Chunyu Qiong should be caught, we shall all be captured too.""Guo Tu said, ""Cao Cao will be too intent on the destruction of the grain to think of leaving a guard. I entreat you to attack his camp.""So Yuan Shao sent five thousand soldiers under Zhang He and Gao Lan to attack Cao Cao's camp, and he sent ten thousand with Jiang Qi to go to recover the grain store."
且說曹操殺散淳于瓊部卒，盡奪其衣甲旗幟，偽作淳于瓊部下敗軍回寨，至山僻小路，正遇蔣奇軍馬。奇軍問之，稱是烏巢敗軍奔回。奇遂不疑，驅馬逕過。張遼、許褚忽至，大喝：「蔣奇休走！」奇措手不及，被張遼斬於馬下，盡殺蔣奇之兵。又使人當先偽報云：「蔣奇已自殺散烏巢兵了。」袁紹因不復遣人接應烏巢，只添兵往官渡。,"Now after overcoming Chunyu Qiong, Cao Cao's troops dressed themselves in the armor and clothing of the defeated soldiers and put out their emblems, thus posing as defeated force running back to their own headquarters. And when they happened upon Jiang Qi's rescue body, they said they had been beaten at Wuchao and were retreating. So Cao Cao's troops were suffered to pass without molestation while Jiang Qi hastened on. But soon Jiang Qi came to Zhang Liao and Xu Chu who cried out, ""Stop!""And before Jiang Qi could make any opposition, Zhang Liao had cut him down. Soon his force were killed or dispersed, and the victors sent false messengers to Yuan Shao's camp to say that Jiang Qi had attacked and driven away the attackers of the granaries. So no more relief were sent that way. However, Yuan Shao sent reinforcements to Guandu."
卻說張郃、高覽攻打曹營，左邊夏侯惇，右邊曹仁，中路曹洪，一齊衝出，三下攻擊，袁軍大敗。比及接應軍到，曹操又從背後殺來，四下圍住掩殺。張郃、高覽奪路走脫。袁紹收得烏巢敗殘軍馬歸寨，見淳于瓊耳鼻皆無，手足盡落。紹問：「如何失了烏巢？」敗軍告說：「淳于瓊醉臥，因此不能抵敵。」,"In due course, the Yuan Shao's force came down upon Cao Cao's camp at Guandu, and the defenders —-Xiahou Dun, Cao Ren, and Cao Hong —-at once came out and fought them on three sides so that they were worsted. By the time reinforcements arrived, Cao Cao's army, returning from the raid, had also come, and Yuan Shao's army were attacked in the rear. So they were quite surrounded. However, Zhang He and Gao Lan managed to force their way out and got away.When the remains of the defenders of the grain stores reached their master's camp, they were mustered. Seeing the mutilated state of their one time leader, Yuan Shao asked how Chunyu Qiong had come to betray his trust and to suffer thus.The soldiers told their lord, ""The General was intoxicated at the time of the attack."""
紹怒，立斬之。郭圖恐張郃、高覽回寨證對是非，先於袁紹前譖曰：「張郃、高覽見主公兵敗，心中必喜。」紹曰：「何出此言乎？」圖曰：「二人素有降曹之意，今遣擊寨，故意不肯用力，以致損折士卒。」紹大怒，遂遣使急召二人歸寨問罪。郭圖先使人報二人云：「主公將殺汝矣。」及紹使至，高覽問曰：「主公喚我等為何？」使者曰：「不知何故。」覽遂拔劍斬來使。郃大驚。覽曰：「袁紹聽信讒言，必為曹操所擒；吾等豈可坐而待死？不如去投曹操。」郃曰：「吾亦有此心久矣。」,"So Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu Qiong to be forthwith executed.Guo Tu, fearing lest Zhang He and Gao Lan would return and testify the whole truth, began to intrigue against them.First Guo Tu went to his lord, saying, ""Those two, Zhang He and Gao Lan, were certainly very glad when your armies were defeated.""""Why do you say this?"" asked Yuan Shao.""O they have long cherished a desire to go over to Cao Cao. So when you sent them on the duty of destroying his camp, they did not do their best and so brought about this disaster.""Yuan Shao accordingly sent to recall these two to be interrogated as to their faults. But Guo Tu sent a messenger in advance to warn them, as though in friendly guise, of the adverse fate that awaited them.So when the orders reached them to return to answer for their faults, Gao Lan asked, ""For what reason are we recalled?""""Indeed I do not know,"" said the messenger.Gao Lan drew his sword and killed the messenger.Zhang He was astonished at this demonstration, but Gao Lan said, ""Our lord has allowed someone to malign us and say we have been bought by Cao Cao. What is the sense in our sitting still and awaiting destruction? Rather let us surrender to Cao Cao in reality and save our lives.""""I have been wanting to do this for some time,"" replied Zhang He."
於是二人領本部兵馬，往曹操寨中投降。夏侯惇曰：「張、高二人來降，未知虛實。」操曰：「吾以恩遇之，雖有異心，亦可變矣。」遂開營門命二人入。二人倒戈卸甲，拜伏於地。操曰：「若使袁紹肯從二將軍之言，不至有敗。今二將軍肯來相投，如微子去殷，韓信歸漢也。」遂封張郃為偏將軍都亭侯，高覽為偏將軍東萊侯。二人大喜。,"Wherefore both, with their companies, made their way to Cao Cao's camp to surrender.When they arrived, Xiahou Dun said to his master, ""These two have come to surrender, but I have doubts about them.""Cao Cao replied, ""I will meet them generously and win them over, even if they have treachery in their hearts.""The camp gates were opened to the two officers, and they were invited to enter. They laid down their weapons, removed their armor, and bowed to the ground before Cao Cao, who said, ""If Yuan Shao had listened to you, he would not have suffered defeat. Now you two coming to surrender are like Wei Zi leaving the falling House of Shang to go to Zhou and Han Xin leaving Xiang Yu to go over to the rising House of Han.""Cao Cao made them Generals and conferred upon Zhang He the title of Lord of Duting and upon Gao Lan Lord of Donglai, which pleased them much."
卻說袁紹既去了許攸，又去了張郃、高覽，又失了烏巢糧，軍心皇皇。許攸又勸曹操作速進兵；張郃、高覽請為先鋒；操從之。即令張郃、高覽領兵往劫紹寨。當夜三更時分，出軍三路劫寨。混戰到明，各自收兵，紹軍折其大半。荀攸獻計曰：「今可揚言調撥人馬，一路取酸棗，攻鄴郡；一路取黎陽，斷袁兵歸路。袁紹聞之，必然驚惶，分兵拒我；我乘其兵動時擊之，紹可破也。」,"And so as Yuan Shao had formerly driven sway his adviser, Xu You, so now he had alienated two leaders and had lost his stores at Wuchao, and his army was depressed and down-hearted.When Xu You advised Cao Cao to attack Yuan Shao as promptly as he could, the two newly surrendered generals volunteered to lead the way. So Cao Cao sent Zhang He and Gao Lan to make a first attack on the camp, and they left in the night with three thousand troops. The fighting went on confusedly all night but stayed at dawn. Yuan Shao had lost half of his army.Then Xun You suggested a plan to Cao Cao, saying, ""Now is the moment to spread a report that an army will go to take Suanzao and attack Yejun, and another to take Liyang and intercept the enemy's retreat. Yuan Shao, when he hears of this, will be alarmed and tell off his troops to meet this new turn of affairs; and while he is making these new dispositions, we can have him at great disadvantage."""
操用其計，使大小三軍，四遠揚言。紹軍聞此信，來寨中報說：「曹操分兵兩路：一路取鄴郡，一路取黎陽去也。」紹大驚，急遣袁尚分兵五萬救鄴郡，辛明分兵五萬救黎陽，連夜起行。曹操探知袁紹兵動，便分大隊軍馬，八路齊出，直衝紹營。袁軍俱無鬥志，四散奔走，遂大潰。袁紹披甲不迭，單衣幅巾上馬；幼子袁譚後隨。張遼、許褚、徐晃、于禁四員將，引軍追趕袁紹。紹急渡河，盡棄圖書車仗金帛，止引隨行八百餘騎而去。,"Cao Cao adopted the suggestion, and care was taken that the report spread far around. It came to the ears of Yuan Shao's soldiers, and they repeated it in camp. Yuan Shao believed it and ordered his son Yuan Tan with fifty thousand troops to rescue Yejun, and General Xin Ming with another fifty thousand to go to Liyang, and they marched away at once. Cao Cao heard that these armies had started, and at once dispatched troops in eight divisions to make a simultaneous attack on the nearly empty camp. Yuan Shao's troops were too dispirited to fight and gave way on all sides. Yuan Shao without waiting to don his armor went forth in simple dress with an ordinary cap upon his head and mounted his steed. His youngest son, Yuan Shang, followed him. Four of the enemy generals —-Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, Xu Huang, and Yu Jin —-with their forces pressed in his rear, and Yuan Shao hastened across the river, abandoning all his documents and papers, baggage, treasure, and stores. Only eight hundred horsemen followed him over the stream."
操軍追之不及，盡獲遺下之物。所殺八萬餘人，血流盈溝，溺水死者不計其數。操獲全勝，將所得金寶緞疋，給賞軍士。於圖書中檢出書信一束，皆許都及軍中諸人與紹暗通之書。左右曰：「可逐一點對姓名，收而殺之。」操曰：「當紹之強，孤亦不能自保，況他人乎？」遂命盡焚之，更不再問。,"Cao Cao's troops followed hard but could not come up with him. However, they captured all his impedimenta, and they slew some eighty thousands of his army so that the watercourses ran blood and the drowned corpses could not be counted. It was a most complete victory for Cao Cao, and he made over all the spoil to the army.Among the papers of Yuan Shao was found a bundle of letters showing secret correspondence between him and many persons in the capital and army.Cao Cao's personal staff suggested that the names of those concerned should be abstracted and the persons arrested, but their lord said, ""Yuan Shao was so strong that even I could not be sure of safety. How much less other people?""So Cao Cao ordered the papers to be burned and nothing more was said."
卻說袁紹兵敗而奔，沮授因被囚禁，急走不脫，為曹軍所獲，擒見曹操。操素與沮授相識。授見操，大呼曰：「授不降也！」操曰：「本初無謀，不用君言，君何尚執迷耶？吾若早得足下，天下不足慮也。」因厚待之，留於軍中。授乃於營中盜馬，欲歸袁氏。操怒，乃殺之。授至死神色不變。操歎曰：「吾誤殺忠義之士也！」命厚禮殯殮，為建墳安葬於黃河渡口，題其墓曰：「忠烈沮君之墓」。後人有詩贊曰：,"Now when Yuan Shao's soldiers ran away, Ju Shou, being a prisoner, could not get away and was captured.Taken before Cao Cao, who knew him, Ju Shou cried aloud, ""I will not surrender!""Said Cao Cao, ""Yuan Shao was foolish and neglected your advice: Why still cling to the path of delusion? Had I had you to help me, I should have been sure of the empire.""Ju Shou was well treated in the camp, but he stole a horse and tried to get away to Yuan Shao. This angered Cao Cao who recaptured him and put him to death, which he met with brave composure.""I have slain a faithful and righteous man!"" then said Cao Cao sadly.And the victim was honorably buried at Guandu. His tomb bore the inscription This is the tomb of Ju Shou the Loyal and Virtuous."
河北多名士，忠貞推沮君。凝眸知陣法，仰面識天文。至死心如鐵，臨危氣似雲。曹公欽義烈，特與建孤墳。,"Ju Shou was honest and virtuous,The best in Yuan Shao's train,From him the stars no secrets held,In tactics all was plain.For him no terrors had grim death.Too lofty was his spirit,His captor slew him, but his tombBears witness to his merit."
操下令攻。正是：勢弱只因多算勝，兵強卻為寡謀亡。未知勝負如何，且看下文分解。,"Cao Cao now gave orders to attack Jizhou.In feeling over confident, that's where one's weakness lay;The other bettered him by plans which never went astray.The following chapter will tell who won the next campaign."
