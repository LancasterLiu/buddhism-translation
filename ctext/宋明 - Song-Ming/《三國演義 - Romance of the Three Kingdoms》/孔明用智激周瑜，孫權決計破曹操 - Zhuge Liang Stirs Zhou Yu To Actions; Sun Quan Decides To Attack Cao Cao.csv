卻說吳國太見孫權疑惑不決，乃謂之曰：「先姊遺言云：『伯符臨終有言：內事不決問張昭，外事不決問周瑜。』今何不請公瑾問之？」權大喜，即遣使往鄱陽請周瑜議事。原來周瑜在鄱陽湖訓練水師，聞曹操大軍至漢上，便星夜回柴桑郡議軍機事。使者未發，周瑜已先到。魯肅與瑜最厚，先來接著，將前項事細述一番。周瑜曰：「子敬休憂，瑜自有主張。今可速請孔明來相見。」,"The dying message which Lady Wu recalled to Sun Quan's memory was, ""For internal matters consult Zhang Zhao; for external policy Zhou Yu.""Wherefore Zhou Yu was summoned.But Zhou Yu was already on the way. He had been training his naval forces on Poyang Lake when he heard of the approach of Cao Cao's hosts and had started for Chaisang without loss of time. So, before the messenger ordered to call him could start, he had already arrived. As he and Lu Su were close friends, the latter went to welcome him and told him of all that had happened.""Have no anxiety,"" said Zhou Yu. ""I shall be able to decide this. But go quickly and beg Zhuge Liang to come to see me."""
魯肅上馬去了。周瑜方纔歇息。忽報張昭、顧雍、張紘、步騭四人來相探。瑜接入堂中坐定，敘寒溫畢。張昭曰：「都督知江東之利害否？」瑜曰：「未知也。」昭曰：「曹操擁眾百萬，屯於漢上，昨傳檄文至此，欲請主公會獵於江夏。雖有相吞之意，尚未露其形。昭等勸主公且降之，庶免江東之禍。不想魯子敬從江夏帶劉備軍師諸葛亮至此，彼因自欲雪憤，特下說詞以激主公。子敬卻執迷不悟。正欲待都督一決。」瑜曰：「公等之見皆同否？」顧雍等曰：「所議皆同。」瑜曰：「吾亦欲降久矣。公等請回。明早見主公，自有定議。」,"So Lu Su went to seek out Zhuge Liang.Zhou Yu had many other visitors. First came Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong, Gu Yong, and Bu Zhi to represent their faction to find out what might be afoot.They were received, and after the exchange of the usual commonplaces, Zhang Zhao said, ""Have you heard of our terrible danger?""""I have heard nothing,"" said Zhou Yu.""Cao Cao and his hordes are encamped up the Han River. He has just sent letters asking our lord to hunt with him in Jiangxia. He may have a desire to absorb this country but, if so, the details of his designs are still secret. We prayed our master to give in his submission and so avoid the horrors of war, but now Lu Su has returned bringing with him the Directing Instructor of Liu Bei's army, Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang, desiring to avenge himself for the recent defeat, has talked our lord into a mind for war, and Lu Su persists in supporting that policy. They only await your final decision.""""Are you all unanimous in your opinions?""""We are perfectly unanimous,"" said Zhang Zhao.Zhou Yu said, ""The fact is I have also desired to submit for a long time. I beg you to leave me now, and tomorrow we will see our master, and I shall make up his mind for him."""
昭等辭去。少頃，又報程普、黃蓋、韓當等一班戰將來見。瑜迎入，各問慰訖。程普曰：「都督知江東早晚屬他人否？」瑜曰：「未知也。」普曰：「吾等自隨孫將軍開基創業，大小數百戰，方纔戰得六郡城池。今主公聽謀士之言，欲降曹操，此真可恥可惜之事。吾等寧死不辱。望都督勸主公決計興兵。吾等願效死戰。」瑜曰：「將軍等所見皆同否？」黃蓋忿然而起，以手拍額曰：「吾頭可斷，誓不降曹！」眾人皆曰：「吾等皆不願降。」瑜曰：「吾正欲與曹操決戰，安肯投降？將軍等請回。瑜見主公，自有定議。」,"So they took their leave. Very soon came the military party led by Cheng Pu, Huang Gai, and Han Dang. They were admitted and duly inquired after their host's health.Then the leader Cheng Pu said, ""Have you heard that our country is about to pass under another's government?""""No, I have heard nothing,"" replied the host.""We helped General Sun Quan to establish his authority here and carve out this kingdom, and to gain that end we fought many a battle before we conquered the country. Now our lord lends his ear to his civil officers and desires to submit himself to Cao Cao. This is a most shameful and pitiful course, and we would rather die than follow it. So we hope you will decide to fight, and you may depend upon our struggling to the last person.""""And are you unanimous, Generals?"" asked Zhou Yu.Huang Gai suddenly started up and smote his forehead, saying, ""They may take my head, but I swear never to surrender.""""Not one of us is willing to surrender,"" cried all the others.""My desire also is to decide matters with Cao Cao on the battlefield. How could we think of submission? Now I pray you retire, Generals, and when I see our lord, I will settle his doubts."""
程普等別去。又未幾，諸葛瑾、呂範等一班兒文官相候。瑜迎入，講禮畢。諸葛瑾曰：「舍弟諸葛亮自漢上來，言劉豫州欲結東吳，共伐曹操，文武商議未定。因舍弟為使，瑾不敢多言，專候都督來決此事。」瑜曰：「以公論之若何？」瑾曰：「降者易安，戰者難保。」周瑜笑曰：「瑜自有主張。來日同至府下定議。」,"So the war party left. They were quickly succeeded by Zhuge Jin, Lu Fan, and their faction.They were brought in and, after the usual courtesies, Zhuge Jin said, ""My brother has come down the river saying that Liu Bei desires to ally himself with our lord against Cao Cao. The civil and military hold different opinions as to the course to be pursued. But as my brother is so deeply concerned, I am unwilling to say much on either side. We are awaiting your decision.""""And what do you think about it?"" asked Zhou Yu.""Submission is an easy road to tranquillity, while the result of war is hard to foretell.""Zhou Yu smiled, ""I shall have my mind made up. Come tomorrow to the palace, and the decision shall be announced."""
瑾等辭退。忽又報呂蒙、甘寧等一班兒來見。瑜請入，亦敘談此事。有要戰者，有要降者，互相爭論。瑜曰：「不必多言，來日都到府下公議。」眾乃辭去。周瑜冷笑不止。,"The trimmers took their leave. But soon after came Lu Meng, Gan Ning, and their supporters, also desirous of discussing the same thing, and they told him that opinions differed greatly, some being for peace and others for war. One party constantly disputed with the other.""I must not say much now,"" replied Zhou Yu, ""but you will see tomorrow in the palace, when the matter will be fully debated.""They went away leaving Zhou Yu smiling cynically."
至晚，人報魯子敬引孔明來拜。瑜出中門迎入。敘禮畢，分賓主而坐。肅先問瑜曰：「今曹操驅眾南侵，和與戰二策，主公不能決，一聽於將軍。將軍之意若何？」瑜曰：「曹操以天子為名，其師不可拒。且其勢大，未可輕敵。戰則必敗，降則易安。吾意已決。來日見主公，便當遣使納降。」,"About eventide Lu Su and Zhuge Liang came, and Zhou Yu went out to the main gate to receive them.When they had taken their proper seats, Lu Su spoke first, saying, ""Cao Cao has come against the South Land with a huge army. Our master cannot decide whether to submit or give battle and waits for your decision. What is your opinion?""Zhou Yu replied, ""We may not oppose Cao Cao when he acts at the command of the Emperor. Moreover, he is very strong, and to attack him is to take serious risks. In my opinion, opposition would mean defeat and, since submission means peace, I have decided to advise our lord to write and offer surrender."""
魯肅愕然曰：「君言差矣！江東基業，已歷三世，豈可一旦棄於他人？伯符遺言，外事付託將軍。今正欲仗將軍保全國家，為泰山之靠，奈何亦從懦夫之議耶？」瑜曰：「江東六郡，生靈無限；若罹兵革之禍，必有歸怨於我，故決計請降耳。」肅曰：「不然。以將軍之英雄，東吳之險固，操未必便能得志也。」,"""But you are wrong!"" stammered Lu Su. ""This country has been under the same rule for three generations and cannot be suddenly abandoned to some other. Our late lord Sun Ce said that you were to be consulted on matters beyond the border, and we depended upon you to keep the country as secure and solid as the Taishan Mountains. Now you adopt the view of the weaklings and propose to yield! I cannot believe you mean it.""Replied Zhou Yu, ""The six territories contain countless people. If I am the means of bringing upon them the misery of war, they will hate me. So I have decided to advise submission.""""But do you not realize our lord's might and the strength of our country? If Cao Cao does attack, it is very uncertain that he will realize his desire."""
二人互相爭辯，孔明只袖手冷笑。瑜曰：「先生何故哂笑？」孔明曰：「亮不笑別人，笑子敬不識時務耳。肅曰：「先生如何反笑我不識時務？」孔明曰：「公瑾主意欲降操，甚為合理。」瑜曰：「孔明乃識時務之士，必與吾有同心。」肅曰：「孔明，你也如何說此？」孔明曰：「操極善用兵，天下莫敢當。向只有呂布、袁紹、袁術、劉表敢與對敵。今數人皆被操滅，天下無人矣。獨有劉豫州不識時務，強與爭衡。今孤身江夏，存亡未保。將軍決計降曹，可以保妻子，可以全富貴。國祚遷移，付之天命，何足惜哉！」,"The two wrangled for a long time, while Zhuge Liang sat smiling with folded arms.Presently Zhou Yu asked, ""Why do you smile thus, Master?""And Zhuge Liang replied, ""I am smiling at no other than your opponent Lu Su, who knows nothing of the affairs of the day.""""Master,"" said Lu Su, ""what do you mean?""""Why, this intention to submit is perfectly reasonable. It is the one proper thing.""""There!"" exclaimed Zhou Yu. ""Zhuge Liang knows the times perfectly well, and he agrees with me.""""But, both of you, why do you say this?"" said Lu Su.Said Zhuge Liang, ""Cao Cao is an excellent commander, so good that no one dares oppose him. Only very few have ever attempted it, and they have been exterminated —-the world knows them no more. The only exception is Liu Bei, who did not understand the conditions and vigorously contended against him, with the result that he is now at Jiangxia in a very parlous state. To submit is to secure the safety of wives and children, to be rich and honored. But the dignity of the country would be left to chance and fate —-however, that is not worth consideration."""
魯肅大怒曰：「汝教吾主屈膝受辱於國賊乎！」孔明曰：「愚有一計。並不勞牽羊擔酒，納土獻印；亦不須親自渡江；只須遣一介之使，扁舟送兩個人到江上。操若得此兩人，百萬之眾，皆卸甲捲旗而退矣。」瑜曰：「用何二人，可退操兵？」孔明曰：「江東去此兩人，如大木飄一葉，太倉減一粟耳。而操得之，必大喜而去。」,"Lu Su interrupted angrily, ""Would you make our lord crook the knee to such a rebel as Cao Cao?""""Well,"" replied Zhuge Liang, ""there is another way, and a cheaper. There would be no need to 'lead the sheep and shoulder wine pots' for presents, nor any need to yield territory and surrender seals of office. It would not even be necessary to cross the river yourselves. All you would require is a simple messenger and a little boat to ferry a couple of persons across the river. If Cao Cao only got these two under his hand, his hordes and legions would just drop their weapons, furl their banners, and silently vanish away.""""What two persons could cause Cao Cao to go away as you say?"" asked Zhou Yu.""Two persons who could be easily spared from this populous country. They would not be missed any more than a leaf from a tree or a grain of millet from a granary. But if Cao Cao could only get them, would he not go away rejoicing?"""
瑜又問果用何二人孔明曰：「亮居隆中時，即聞操於漳河新造一臺，名曰銅雀，極其壯麗；廣選天下美女以實其中。操本好色之徒，久聞江東喬公有二女，長曰大喬，次曰小喬，有沈魚落雁之容，閉月羞花之貌。操曾發誓曰：『吾一願掃平四海，以成帝業；一願得江東二喬，置之銅雀臺，以樂晚年，雖死無恨矣。』今雖引百萬之眾，虎視江南，其實為此二女也。將軍何不去尋喬公，以千金買此二女，差人送與曹操。操得二女，稱心滿意，必班師矣。此范蠡獻西施之計，何不速為之？」,"""But who are the two?"" asked Zhou Yu again.""When I was living in the country, they told me that Cao Cao was building a pavilion on the River Zhang. It was to be named the Bronze Bird Tower. It is an exceedingly handsome building, and he has sought throughout all the world for the most beautiful women to live in it. For Cao Cao really is a sensualist.""Now there are two very famous beauties in Wu, born of the Qiao family. So beautiful are they that birds alight and fishes drown, the moon hides her face and the flowers blush for shame at sight of them. Cao Cao has declared with an oath that he only wants two things in this world: The imperial throne in peace and the sight of those two women on the Bronze Bird Terraces. Given these two, he would go down to his grave without regret. This expedition of his, his huge army that threatens this country, has for its real aim these two women. Why do you not buy these two from their father, the State Patriarch Qiao, for any sum however large and send them over the river? The object of the army being attained, it will simply be marched away. This is the ruse that Fan Li of Yue made to the king of Wu of the famous beauty Xi Shi."""
瑜曰：「操欲得二喬，有何證驗？」孔明曰：「曹操幼子曹植，字子建，下筆成文。操嘗命作一賦，名曰銅雀臺賦。賦中之意，單道他家合為天子，誓取二喬。」瑜曰：「此賦公能記否？」孔明曰：「吾愛其文華美，嘗竊記之。」瑜曰：「試請一誦。」孔明即時誦銅雀臺賦云：,"""How do you know Cao Cao so greatly desires these two?"" said Zhou Yu.""Because his son Cao Zhi, who is an able writer, at the command of his father wrote a poem 'An Ode to the Bronze Bird Terrace,' theme only allowing allusions to the family fitness for the throne. He has sworn to possess these two women. I think I can remember the poem, if you wish to hear it. I admire it greatly.""""Try,"" said Zhou Yu.So Zhuge Liang recited the poem:"
從明后以嬉游兮，登層臺以娛情。見太府之廣開兮，觀聖德之所營。建高門之嵯峨兮，浮雙闕乎太清。立中天之華觀兮，連飛閣乎西城。臨漳水之長流兮，望園果之滋榮。立雙臺於左右兮，有玉龍與金鳳。攬二喬於東南兮，樂朝夕之與共。俯皇都之宏麗兮，瞰雲霞之浮動。欣群才之來萃兮，協飛熊之吉夢。仰春風之和穆兮，聽百鳥之悲鳴。雲天互其既立兮，家願得乎雙逞。揚仁化於宇宙兮，盡肅恭於上京。惟桓文之為盛兮，豈足方乎聖明？,"""Let me follow in the footsteps of the enlightened ruler that I may rejoice,And ascend the storied terrace that I may gladden my heart,That I may see the wide extent of the palace,That I may gaze upon the plans of the virtuous one.He has established the exalted gates high as the hills,He has built the lofty towers piercing the blue vault,He has set up the beautiful building in the midst of the heavens,Whence the eye can range over the cities of the west.On the banks of the rolling River Zhang he planned it,Whence abundance of fruits could be looked for in his gardens.The two towers rise, one on either flank,This named Golden Phoenix, that Jade Dragon.He would have the two Qiaos, these beautiful ladies of Wu,That he might rejoice with them morning and evening.Look down; there is the grand beauty of an imperial city,And the rolling vapors lie floating beneath.He will rejoice in the multitude of scholars that assemble,Answering to the felicitous dream of King Wen.Look up; and there is the gorgeous harmony of springtime,And the singing of many birds delighting the ear;The lofty sky stands over all.The house desires success in its double undertaking,That the humane influence may be poured out over all the world,That the perfection of reverence may be offered to the Ruler.Only the richly prosperous rule of Kings Wu and HuanCould compare with that of the sacred understanding"
休矣！美矣！惠澤遠揚。翼佐我皇家兮，寧彼四方。同天地之規量兮，齊日月之輝光。永貴尊而無極兮，等君壽於東皇。御龍旂以遨遊兮，迴鸞駕而周章。恩化及乎四海兮，嘉物阜而民康。愿斯臺之永固兮，樂終古而未央！,"That fortune! What beauty!The gracious kindness spreads afar,The imperial family is supported,Peace reigns over all the empire,Bounded only by the universe.Bright as the glory of the sun and moon,Ever honorable and ever enduring,The Ruler shall live to the age of the eastern emperor,The dragon banner shall wave to the farthest limit.His glorious chariot shall be guided with perfect wisdom,His thoughts shall reform all the world,Felicitous produce shall be abundant,And the people shall rest firm.My desire is that these towers shall endure forever,And that joy shall never cease through all the ages."
周瑜聽罷，勃然大怒，離座指北而罵曰：「老賊欺吾太甚！」孔明急起止之曰：「昔單于屢侵疆界，漢天子許以公主和親，今何惜民間二女乎？」瑜曰：「公有所不知。大喬是孫伯符將軍主婦，小喬乃瑜之妻也。」孔明佯作惶恐之狀，曰：「亮實不知。失口亂言，死罪！死罪！」瑜曰：「吾與老賊誓不兩立！」孔明曰：「事須三思，免致後悔。」瑜曰：「吾承伯符寄託，安有屈身降操之理？適來所言，故相試耳。吾自離鄱陽湖，便有北伐之心，雖刀斧加頭，不易其志也。望孔明助一臂之力，同破曹操。」孔明曰：「若蒙不棄，願效犬馬之勞，早晚拱聽驅策。」瑜曰：「來日入見主公，便議起兵。」,"Zhou Yu listened to the end but then suddenly jumped up in a tremendous rage.Turning to the north and pointing with his finger, he cried, ""You old rebel, this insult is too deep!""Zhuge Liang hastily rose too and soothed him, saying, ""But remember the Khan of the Xiongnu People. The Han emperor gave him a princess of the family to wife although he had made many incursions into our territory. That was the price of peace. You surely would not grudge two more women from among the common people.""""You do not know, Sir,"" replied Zhou Yu. ""Of those two women of the Qiao family you mentioned, Elder Qiao is the widow of Sun Ce, our late ruler, and Younger Qiao is my wife!""Zhuge Liang feigned the greatest astonishment and said, ""No indeed: I did not know. I blundered —-a deadly fault —-a deadly fault!""""One of us two has to go: Either the old rebel or I. We shall not both live. I swear that!"" cried Zhou Yu.""However, such a matter needs a good deal of thought,"" replied Zhuge Liang. ""We must not make any mistake.""Zhou Yu replied, ""I hold a sacred trust from my late lord, Sun Ce. I would not bow the knee to any such as Cao Cao. What I said just now was to see how you stood. I left Poyang Lake with the intention of attacking the north, and nothing can change that intention, not even the sword at my breast or the ax on my neck. But I trust you will lend an arm, and we will smite Cao Cao together.""""Should I be happy enough not to be rejected, I would render such humble service as I could. Perhaps presently I might be able to offer a plan to oppose him.""""I am going to see my lord tomorrow to discuss this matter,"" said Zhou Yu."
孔明與魯肅辭出，相別而去。次日清晨，孫權升堂。左邊文官張昭、顧雍等三十餘人；右邊武官程普、黃蓋等三十餘人。衣冠濟濟，劍佩鏘鏘，分班侍立。,"Zhuge Liang and Lu Su then left.Next day at dawn Sun Quan went to the council chamber, where his officials, civil and military, were already assembled. They numbered about sixty in all. The civil, with Zhang Zhao at their head, were on the right; the military, with Cheng Pu as their leader, were ranged on the left. All were in full ceremonial dress, and the swords of the soldiers clanked on the pavement."
少頃，周瑜入見。禮畢，孫權問慰罷。瑜曰：「近聞曹操引兵屯漢上，馳書至此，主公尊意若何？」權即取檄文與周瑜看，瑜看畢，笑曰：「老賊以我江東無人，敢如此相侮耶！」權曰：「君之意若何？」瑜曰：「主公曾與眾文武商議否？」權曰：「連日議此事，有勸我降者，有勸我戰者。吾意未定，故請公謹一決。」瑜曰：「誰勸主公降？」權曰：「張子布等皆主其意。」瑜即問張昭曰：「願聞先生所以主降之意。」昭曰：「曹操挾天子而征四方，動以朝廷為名，近又得荊州，威勢愈大。吾江東可以拒操者，長江耳。今操艨艟戰艦，何止千百？水陸並進，何可當之？不如且降，更圖後計。」瑜曰：「此迂儒之論也！江東自開國以來，今歷三世，安忍一旦廢棄！」權曰：「若此計將安出？」,"Soon Zhou Yu entered.When Sun Quan had finished the usual gracious remarks, Zhou Yu said, ""I hear that Cao Cao is encamped on the river and has sent a dispatch to you, my lord. I would ask what your opinion is.""Thereupon the dispatch was produced and handed to Zhou Yu.After reading it through he said, smiling, ""The old thief thinks there are no people in this land that he writes in this contemptuous strain.""""What do you think, Sir?"" asked Sun Quan.""Have you discussed this with the officials?"" asked Zhou Yu.""We have been discussing this for days. Some counsel surrender and some advise fight. I am undecided, and therefore I have asked you to come and decide the point.""""Who advise surrender?"" asked Zhou Yu.""Zhang Zhao and his party are firmly set in this opinion.""Zhou Yu then turned to Zhang Zhao and said, ""I should be pleased to hear why you are for surrender, Master.""Then Zhang Zhao replied, ""Cao Cao has been attacking all opponents in the name of the Emperor, who is entirely in his hands. He does everything in the name of the government. Lately he has taken Jingzhou and thereby increased his prestige. Our defense against him was the Great River, but now he also has a large fleet and can attack by water. How can we withstand him? Wherefore I counsel submission till some chance shall offer.""""This is but the opinion of an ill-advised student,"" said Zhou Yu. ""How can you think of abandoning this country that we have held for three generations?""""That being so,"" said Sun Quan, ""where is a plan to come from?"""
瑜曰：「操雖託名漢相，實為漢賊。將軍以神武雄才，仗父兄餘業，據有江東，兵精糧足，正當橫行天下，為國家除殘去暴，奈何降賊耶？且操今此來，多犯兵家之忌：北土未平，馬騰、韓遂為其後患，而操久於南征，一忌也；北軍不諳水戰，操捨鞍馬，仗舟楫，與東吳爭衡，二忌也；又時值隆冬盛寒，馬無蒿草，三忌也；驅中國士卒，遠涉江湖，不服水土，多生疾病，四忌也：操兵犯此數忌，雖多必敗。將軍擒操，正在今日。瑜請得精兵數千，進屯夏口，為將軍破之！」,"""Though Cao Cao assumes the name of the Prime Minister of the empire, he is at heart a rebel. You, O General, are able in war and brave. You are the heir to your father and brother. You command brave and tried soldiers, and you have plentiful supplies. You are able to overrun the whole country and rid it of every evil. There is no reason why you should surrender to a rebel.""Moreover, Cao Cao has undertaken this expedition in defiance of all the rules of war. The north is unsubdued. Ma Teng and Han Sui threaten his rear, and yet he persists in his southern march. This is the first point against Cao Cao. The northern soldiers are unused to fighting on the water. Cao Cao is relinquishing his well-tried cavalry and trusting to ships. That is the second point against him. Again, we are now in full winter and the weather is at its coldest so there is no food for the horses. That is the third point against. Soldiers from the central state marching in a wet country among lakes and rivers will find themselves in an unaccustomed climate and suffer from malaria. That is the fourth point against. Now when Cao Cao's armies have all these points against them, defeat is certain, however numerous they may be, and you can take Cao Cao captive just as soon as you wish. Give me a few legions of veterans, and I will go and destroy him."""
權矍然起曰：「老賊欲廢漢自立久矣，所懼二袁、呂布、劉表與孤耳。今數雄已滅，惟孤尚存。孤與老賊，誓不兩立！卿言當伐，甚合孤意。此天以卿授我也。」瑜曰：「臣為將軍決一血戰，萬死不辭。只恐將軍狐疑不定。」權拔佩劍砍面前奏案一角曰：「諸官將有再言降操者，與此案同！」言罷，便將此劍賜周瑜，即封瑜為大都督，程普為副都督，魯肅為贊軍校尉。如文武官將有不聽號令者，即以此劍誅之。,"Sun Quan started up from his place, saying, ""The rebellious old rascal has been wanting to overthrow the Hans and set up himself for years. He has rid himself of all those he feared, save only myself, and I swear that one of us two shall go now. Both of us cannot live. What you say, noble friend, is just what I think, and Heaven has certainly sent you to my assistance.""""Thy servant will fight a decisive battle,"" said Zhou Yu, ""and shrink not from any sacrifice. Only, General, do not hesitate.""Sun Quan drew the sword that hung at his side and slashed off a corner of the table in front of him, exclaiming, ""Let any other person mention surrender, and he shall be served as I have served this table!""Then he handed the sword to Zhou Yu, at the same time giving him a commission as Commander-in-Chief and Supreme Admiral, Cheng Pu being Vice-Admiral. Lu Su was also nominated as Assistant Commander.In conclusion Sun Quan said, ""With this sword you will slay any officer who may disobey your commands."""
瑜受了劍，對眾言曰：「吾奉主公之命，率眾破曹。諸將官吏來日俱於江畔行營聽令。如遲誤者，依七禁令五十四斬施行。」言罷，辭了孫權，起身出府。眾文武各無言而散。,"Zhou Yu took the sword and turning to the assembly said, ""You have heard our lord's charge to me to lead you to destroy Cao Cao. You will all assemble tomorrow at the riverside camp to receive my orders. Should any be late or fail, then the full rigor of military law —-the seven prohibitions and the fifty-four capital penalties —-there provided, will be enforced.""Zhou Yu took leave of Sun Quan and left the chamber. The various officers also went their several ways."
周瑜回到下處，便請孔明議事。孔明至。瑜曰：「今日府下公議已定，願求破曹良策。」孔明曰：「孫將軍心尚未穩，不可以決策也。」瑜曰：「何謂心不穩？」孔明曰：「心怯曹兵之多，懷寡不敵眾之意；將軍以軍數開解，使其了然無疑，然後大事可成。」瑜曰：「先生之論甚善。」,"When Zhou Yu reached his own place, he sent for Zhuge Liang to consult over the business in hand. He told Zhuge Liang of the decision that had been taken and asked for a plan of campaign.""But your master has not yet made up his mind,"" said Zhuge Liang. ""Till he has, no plan can be decided upon.""""What do you mean?""""In his heart, Sun Quan is still fearful of Cao Cao's numbers and frets over the inequality of the two armies. You will have to explain away those numbers and bring him to a final decision before anything can be effected.""""What you say is excellent,"" said Zhou Yu."
乃復入見孫權。權曰：「公瑾夜至，必有事故。」瑜曰：「來日調撥軍馬，主公心有疑否？」權曰：「但憂曹操兵多，寡不敵眾耳。他無所疑。」瑜笑曰：「瑜正為此，特來開解主公。主公因見操檄文，言水陸大軍百萬，故懷疑懼，不復料其虛實。今以實較之：彼將中國之兵，不過十五六萬，且已久疲，所得袁氏之眾，亦止七八萬耳，尚多懷疑未服。未以久疲之卒，狐疑之眾，其數雖多，不足畏也。瑜得五萬兵，自足破之。願主公勿以為慮。」權撫瑜背曰：「公瑾此言，足釋吾疑。子布無謀，深失孤望。獨卿及子敬與孤同心耳。卿可與子敬、程普，即日選軍前進。孤當續發人馬，多載資糧，為卿後應。卿前軍倘不如意，便還就孤。孤當親與曹賊決戰，更無他疑。」,"He went to the palace that night to see his master.Sun Quan said, ""You must have something of real importance to say if you come like this at night.""Zhou Yu said, ""I am making my dispositions tomorrow. You have quite made up your mind?""""The fact is,"" said Sun Quan, ""I still feel nervous about the disparity of numbers. Surely we are too few. That is really all I feel doubtful about.""""It is precisely because you have this one remaining doubt that I am come. And I will explain. Cao Cao's letter speaks of a million of marines, and so you feel doubts and fears and do not wait to consider the real truth. Let us examine the case thoroughly. We find that he has of central regions' soldiers, say, some one hundred fifty thousand troops, and many of them are sick. He only got seventy or eighty thousand northern soldiers from Yuan Shao, and many of those are of doubtful loyalty. Now these sick men and these men of doubtful loyalty seem a great many, but they are not at all fearsome. I could smash them with fifty thousand soldiers. You, my lord, have no further anxiety."""
周瑜謝出，暗忖曰：「孔明早已料著吳侯之心。其計畫又高我一頭。久必為江東之患，不如殺之。」乃令人連夜請魯肅入帳，言欲殺孔明之事。肅曰：「不可。今操賊未破，先殺賢士，是自去其助也。」瑜曰：「此人助劉備，必為江東之患。」肅曰：「諸葛瑾乃其親兄，可令招此人同事東吳，豈不妙哉？」,"Sun Quan patted his general on the back, saying, ""You have explained my difficulty and relieved my doubts. Zhang Zhao is a fool who constantly bars my expeditions. Only you and Lu Su have any real understanding of my heart. Tomorrow you and Lu Su and Cheng Pu will start, and I shall have a strong reserve ready with plentiful supplies to support you. If difficulties arise, you can at once send for me, and I will engage with my own army.""Zhou Yu left. But in his innermost heart, he said to himself, ""If that Zhuge Liang can gauge my master's thoughts so very accurately, he is too clever for me and will be a danger. He will have to be put out of the way.""Zhou Yu sent a messenger over to Lu Su to talk over this last scheme. When he had laid it bare, Lu Su did not favor it.""No, no,"" said Lu Su, ""it is self-destruction to make away with your ablest officer before Cao Cao shall have been destroyed.""""But Zhuge Liang will certainly help Liu Bei to our disadvantage.""""Try what his brother Zhuge Jin can do to persuade him. It would be an excellent thing to have these two in our service."""
瑜善其言。次日平明，瑜赴行營，升中軍帳高坐。左右立刀斧手，聚集文官武將聽令。原來程普年長於瑜，今瑜爵居其上，心中不樂；是日乃託病不出，令長子程咨自代。瑜令眾將曰：「王法無親，諸君各守乃職。方今曹操弄權，甚於董卓囚天子於許昌，屯暴兵於境上。吾今奉命討之，諸君幸皆努力向前。大軍到處，不得擾民。賞勞罰罪，並不徇縱。」,"""Yes, indeed,"" replied Zhou Yu.Next morning at dawn, Zhou Yu went to his camp and took his seat in the council tent. The armed guards took up their stations right and left, and the officers ranged themselves in lines to listen to the orders.Now Cheng Pu, who was older than Zhou Yu but was made second in command, was very angry at being passed over, so he made a pretense of indisposition and stayed away from this assembly. But he sent his eldest son, Cheng Zi, to represent him.Zhou Yu addressed the gathering, saying, ""The law knows no partiality, and you will all have to attend to your several duties. Cao Cao is now more absolute than ever was Dong Zhuo, and the Emperor is really a prisoner in Xuchang, guarded by the most cruel soldiers. We have a command to destroy Cao Cao, and with your willing help we shall advance. The army must cause no hardship to the people anywhere. Rewards for good service and punishments for faults shall be given impartially."""
令畢，即差韓當、黃蓋，為前部先鋒，領本部戰船，即日起行，前至三江口下寨，別聽將令；蔣欽、周泰，為第二隊；凌統、潘璋，為第三隊；太史慈、呂蒙，為第四隊；陸遜、董襲為第五隊；呂範、朱治為四方巡警使。催督六隊官軍，水陸並進，剋期取齊。,"Having delivered this charge, Zhou Yu told off Han Dang and Huang Gai as Leaders of the Van, and ordered the ships under their own command to get under way and go to the Three Gorges. They would get orders by and bye. Then he appointed four armies with two leaders over each: The first body was under Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai; the second, Pan Zhang and Ling Tong; the third, Taishi Ci and Lu Meng; the fourth, Lu Xun and Dong Xi. Lu Fan and Zhu Zhi were appointed inspectors, to move from place to place and keep the various units up to their work and acting with due regard to the general plan. Land and marine forces were to move simultaneously. The expedition would soon start."
調撥已畢，諸將各自收拾船隻軍器起行。程咨回見父程普，說周瑜調兵，動止有法。普大驚曰：「吾素欺周郎懦弱，不足為將；今能如此，真將才也！我如何不服？」遂親詣行營謝罪。瑜亦遜謝。,"Having received their orders, each returned to his command and busied himself in preparation. Cheng Zi, the son of Cheng Pu, returned and told his father what arrangements had been made, and Cheng Pu was amazed at Zhou Yu's skill.Said he, ""I have always despised Zhou Yu as a mere student who would never be a general, but this shows that he has a leader's talent. I must support him.""So Cheng Pu went over to the quarters of the Commander-in-Chief and confessed his fault. He was received kindly and all was over."
次日，瑜請諸葛瑾，謂曰：「令弟孔明有王佐之才，如何屈身事劉備？今幸至江東，欲煩先生不惜齒牙餘論，使令弟棄劉備而事東吳，則主公既得良輔，而先生兄弟又得相見，豈不美哉？先生幸即一行。」瑾曰：「瑾自至江東，愧無寸功。今都督有命，敢不效力？」即時上馬，逕投驛亭來見孔明。孔明接入，哭拜，各訴闊情。,"Next Zhou Yu sent for Zhuge Jin and said to him, ""Evidently your brother is a genius, a man born to be a king's counselor. Why then does he serve Liu Bei? Now that he is here, I wish you to use every effort to persuade him to stay with us. Thus our lord would gain able support and you two brothers would be together, which would be pleasant for you both. I wish you success.""Zhuge Jin replied, ""I am ashamed of the little service I have rendered since I came here, and I can do no other than obey your command to the best of my ability.""Thereupon he went away to his brother, whom he found in the guest-house. The younger brother received him; and when he had reached the inner rooms, Zhuge Liang bowed respectfully and, weeping, told his experiences since they parted and his sorrow at their separation."
瑾泣曰：「弟知伯夷、叔齊乎？」孔明暗思：「此必周郎教來說我也。」遂答曰：「夷、齊，古之聖賢也。」瑾曰：「夷、齊雖至餓死首陽山下，兄弟二人亦在一處。我今與你同胞共乳，乃各事其主，不能旦暮相聚，視夷、齊之為人，能無愧乎？」孔明曰：「兄所言者，情也；弟所守者，義也。弟與兄皆漢人。今劉皇叔乃漢室之冑，兄若能去東吳，而與弟同事劉皇叔，則上不愧為漢臣，而骨肉又得相聚，此情義兩全之策也。不識兄意以為何如？」,"Then Zhuge Jin, weeping also, said, ""Brother, do you remember the story of Bo Yi and Shu Qi, the brothers who would not be separated?""""Ah, Zhou Yu has sent him to talk me over,"" thought Zhuge Liang. So he replied, ""They were two of the noble people of old days. Yes, I know.""""Those two, although they perished of hunger near the Shouyang Hills, yet never separated. You and I, born of the same mother and suckled at the same breast, yet serve different masters and never meet. Are you not ashamed when you think of such examples as Bo Yi and Shu Qi?""Zhuge Liang replied, ""You are talking now of love, but what I stand for is duty. We are both men of Han, and Liu Bei is of the family. If you, brother, could leave the South Land and join me in serving the rightful branch, then on the one side we should be honored as Ministers of Han, and on the other we should be together as people of the same flesh and blood should be. Thus love and duty would both receive their proper meed. What do you think of it, my brother?"""
瑾思曰：「我來說他，反被他說了我也。」遂無言回答，起身辭去，回見周瑜，細述孔明之言。瑜曰：「公意若何？」瑾曰：「吾受孫將軍厚恩，安肯相背？」瑜曰：「公既忠心事主，不必多言。吾自有伏孔明之計。」正是：智與智逢宜必合，才和才角又難容。畢竟周瑜何計伏孔明，且看下文分解。,"""I came to persuade him and lo! It is I who is being talked over,"" thought Zhuge Jin.He had no fitting reply to make, so he rose and took his leave. Returning to Zhou Yu, he related the story of the interview.""What do you think?"" asked Zhou Yu.""General Sun Quan has treated me with great kindness, and I could not turn my back on him,"" replied Zhuge Jin.""Since you decide to remain loyal, there is no need to say much. I think I have a plan to win over your brother.""The wisest people see eye to eye,For each but sees the right;But should their several interests clash,They all the fiercer fight.The means by which Zhou Yu tried to get the support of Zhuge Liang will be described in the next chapter."
