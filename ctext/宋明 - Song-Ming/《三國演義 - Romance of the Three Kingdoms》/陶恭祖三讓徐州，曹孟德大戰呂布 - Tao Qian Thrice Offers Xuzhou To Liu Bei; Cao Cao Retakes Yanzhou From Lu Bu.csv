曹操正慌走間，正南上一彪軍到，乃夏侯惇引軍來救援，截住呂布大戰。鬥到黃昏時分，大雨如注，各自引軍分散。操回寨，重賞典韋，加為領軍都尉。,"The last chapter closed with Cao Cao in great danger. However, help came. Xiahou Dun with a body of soldiers found his chief, checked the pursuit, and fought with Lu Bu till dusk. Rain fell in torrents swamping everything; and as the daylight waned, they drew off and Cao Cao reached camp. He rewarded Dian Wei generously and advanced him in rank."
卻說呂布到寨，與陳宮商議。宮曰：「濮陽城中有富戶田氏，家僮千百，為一郡之巨室；可令彼密使人往操寨中下書，言呂溫侯殘暴不仁，民心大怨，今欲移兵黎陽，止有高順在城內，可連夜進兵，我為內應。操若來，誘之入城，四門放火，外設伏兵。曹操雖有經天緯地之才，到此安能得脫也？」呂布從其計，密諭田氏使人逕到操寨。操因新敗，正在躊躇，忽報田氏人到，呈上密書云：「呂布已往黎陽，城中空虛。萬望速來，當為內應。城上插白旗，大書『義』字，便是暗號。」操大喜曰：「天使吾得濮陽也！」重賞來人，一面收拾起兵。劉曄曰：「布雖無謀，陳宮多計。只恐其中有詐，不可不防。明公欲去，當分三軍為三隊：兩隊伏城外接應，一隊入城方可。」,"When Lu Bu reached his camp, he called in his adviser Chen Gong. Then Chen Gong proposed a new stratagem.He said, ""In Puyang there is a rich, leading family, Tian by name, who number thousands, enough to populate a whole county in themselves. Make one of these people go to Cao Cao's camp with a pretended secret letter about your ferocity, and the hatred of the people, and their desire to be rid of you. And spread the news that only Gao Shun is left to guard the city, and they would help anyone who would come to save them. Thus our enemy Cao Cao will be inveigled into the city, and we will destroy him either by fire or ambush. His skill may be equal to encompassing the universe, but he will not escape.""Lu Bu thought this trick might be tried, and they arranged for the Tian family letter to be sent.Coming soon after the defeat, when Cao Cao felt uncertain what step to take next, the secret letter was read with joy:""Lu Bu has marched to Liyang. The city's defense is weak: You must attack immediately, and we will render interior help. Follow the sign of a white flag with the word Rectitude written thereon.""""Heaven is going to give me Puyang!"" said Cao Cao joyfully.So he rewarded the messenger very liberally and began to prepare for the expedition.Then came Liu Ye, saying, ""Lu Bu is no strategist, but Chen Gong is full of guile. I fear treachery in this letter, and you must be careful. If you will go, then enter with only one third your army, leaving the others outside the city as a reserve."""
操從其言，分軍三隊，來至濮陽城下。操先往觀之，見城上遍豎旗旛，西門角上，有一「義」字白旗，心中暗喜。是日午牌，城門開處，兩員將引軍出戰：前軍侯成，後軍高順。操即使典韋出馬，直取侯成。侯成抵敵不過，回馬望城中走。韋趕到弔橋邊，高順亦攔擋不住，都退入城中去了。數內有軍人乘勢混過陣來見操，說是田氏之使，呈上密書。約云：「今夜初更時分，城上鳴鑼為號，便可進兵。某當獻門。」操撥夏侯惇引軍在左，曹洪引軍在右，自己引夏侯淵，李典，樂進，典韋四將，率兵入城。李典曰：「主公且在城外，容某等先入城去。」操喝曰：「我不自往，誰肯向前！」遂當先領兵直入。,"Cao Cao agreed to take this precaution, and split the army into three. He went to Puyang, which he found gay with fluttering flags. Looking carefully he saw among them, at the west gate, the white flag with the looked-for inscription. His heart rejoiced.That day, just about noon, the city gates opened, and two bodies of soldiers appeared as if to fight. Gao Shun was the Front Commander, and Hou Cheng the Rear Commander. Cao Cao told off his general, Dian Wei, to oppose them. Neither body, however, came on to full engagement but fell back into the city. By this move Dian Wei and his troops had been drawn close up to the drawbridge. From within the city several soldiers were seen taking any chance of confusion to escape and come outside.To Cao Cao they said, ""We are clients of the Tian family,"" and they gave him secret letters stating:""The signal will be given about the first watch setting by beating a gong. That will be the time to attack. The gates will be opened.""So Cao Cao ordered Xiahou Dun to march to the left and Cao Hong to the right. Cao Cao led the main army —-together with Xiahou Yuan, Li Dian, and Yue Jing —-into the city.Li Dian pressed upon his master the precaution, saying, ""My lord should stay outside the city. Let us go in first.""But Cao Cao bade him be silent, saying, ""If I do not go, who will advance?""And so at the first watch Cao Cao led the way."
時約初更，月光未上。只聽得西門上吹蠃殼聲，喊聲忽起，門上火把燎亂，城門大開，弔橋放落。曹操爭先拍馬而入。直到州衙，路上不見一人。操知是計，忙撥回馬，大叫：「退兵！」州衙中一聲砲響，四門烈火，轟天而起；金鼓齊鳴，喊聲如江翻海沸。東巷內轉出張遼，西巷內轉出臧霸，夾攻掩殺。操走北門，道傍轉出郝萌、曹性，又殺一陣。操急走南門，高順、侯成攔住。典韋怒目咬牙，衝殺出去。高順、侯成倒走出城。,"The moon had not yet arisen. As he drew near the west gate, they heard a crackling sound, then a loud shouting, and then torches moved hither and thither. Next the gates were thrown wide open, and Cao Cao, whipping up his steed, galloped in.But when he reached the state residence, he noticed the streets were quite deserted, and then he knew he had been tricked. Wheeling round his horse, he shouted to his followers to retire. This was the signal for another move. An explosion of a signal bomb was heard close at hand, and it was echoed from every side in a deafening roar. Gongs and drums beat all around with a roar like rivers rushing backward to their source, and the ocean boiling up from its depths. From two sides east and west came bodies of soldiers eager to attack, led by Lu Bu's generals Zhang Liao and Zang Ba.Cao Cao dashed off toward the north only to find his way barred by Hao Meng and Cao Xing. Cao Cao tried for the south gate, but met enemies led by Gao Shun and Hou Cheng. Cao Cao's trusty commander Dian Wei, with fierce eyes and gritting teeth, at last burst through and got out, with the enemy close after him."
典韋殺到弔橋，回頭不見了曹操，翻身復殺入城來，門下撞著李典。典韋問：「主公何在？」典曰：「吾亦尋不見。」韋曰：「汝在城外催救軍，我入去尋主公。」李典去了。典韋殺入城中，尋覓不見；再殺出城壕邊，撞著樂進。進曰：「主公何在？」韋曰：「我往複兩遭，尋覓不見。」進曰：「同殺入去救主！」兩人到門邊，城上火砲滾下，樂進馬不能入，典韋冒煙突火，又殺入去，到處尋覓。,"But when Dian Wei reached the drawbridge, he glanced behind him and missed his master. Immediately Dian Wei turned back and cut an alley inside. Just within he met Li Dian.""Where is our lord?"" cried Dian Wei.""I am looking for him!"" said Li Dian.""Quick! Get help from outside,"" shouted Dian Wei. ""I will seek him!""So Li Dian hastened for aid, and Dian Wei slashed his way in, looking on every side for Cao Cao. He was not to be found. Dashing out of the city, Dian Wei ran up against Yue Jing, who asked where their lord was.""I have entered the city twice in search of him, but cannot find him!"" said Dian Wei.""Let us go in together."" said Yue Jing.They rode up to the gate. But the noise of bombs and the pouring fire from the gate tower frightened Yue Jing's horse so that it refused to pass. Wherefore Dian Wei alone went in, butting through the smoke and dashing through the flames. But he got in and searched on every side."
卻說曹操見典韋殺出去了，四下裏人馬截來，不得出南門；再轉北門，火光裏正撞見呂布挺戟躍馬而來。操以手掩面，加鞭縱馬竟過。呂布從後拍馬趕來，將戟於操盔上一擊，問曰：「曹操何在？」操反指曰：「前面騎黃馬者是他。」,"When Cao Cao saw his sturdy protector Dian Wei cut his way out and disappear leaving him surrounded, he again made an attempt to reach the north gate. On the way, sharply silhouetted against the glow, he saw the figure of Lu Bu coming toward him with his trident halberd ready to kill. Cao Cao covered his face with his hand, whipped up his steed and galloped past.But Lu Bu came galloping up behind him and tapping him on the helmet with the halberd cried, ""Where is Cao Cao?""Cao Cao turned and, pointing to a dun horse well ahead, cried, ""There: On that dun! That is he!"""
呂布聽說，棄了曹操，縱馬向前追趕。曹操撥轉馬頭，望東門而走，正逢典韋。韋擁護曹操，殺條血路，到城門邊，火燄甚盛，城下推下柴草，遍地都是火。韋用戟撥開，飛馬冒煙突火先出。曹操隨後亦出。方到門道邊，城門上崩下一條火梁來，正打著曹操戰馬後胯，那馬撲地倒了。操用手托梁推放地上，手臂鬚髮，盡被燒傷。,"Hearing this Lu Bu left pursuing Cao Cao to gallop after the rider of the dun.Thus relieved Cao Cao set off for the east gate. Then he fell in with Dian Wei, who took him under his protection and fought through the press, leaving a trail of death behind till they reached the gate. Here the fire was raging fiercely, and burning beams were falling on all sides. The earth element seemed to have interchanged with the fire element. Dian Wei warded off the burning pieces of wood with his lance and rode into the smoke making a way for his lord. Just as they were passing through the gate a flaming beam fell from the gate tower. Cao Cao just warded it off with his arm, but it struck his steed on the quarters and knocked the steed down. Cao Cao's hand and arm were badly burned and his hair and beard singed."
典韋回馬來救，恰好夏侯淵亦到。兩個同救起曹操，突火而出。操乘淵馬，典韋殺條大路而走。直混戰到天明，操方回寨。眾將拜伏問安，操仰面笑曰：「誤中匹夫之計，吾必當報之！」郭嘉曰：「計可速發。」操曰：「今只將計就計：詐言我被火傷，火毒攻發，五更已經身死。布必引兵來攻。我伏兵於馬陵山中，候其兵半渡而擊之，布可擒矣。」嘉曰：「真良策也！」於是令軍士挂孝發喪，詐言操死。早有人來濮陽報呂布，說曹操被火燒傷肢體，到寨身死。布隨點起軍馬，殺奔馬陵山來。將到操寨，一聲鼓響，伏兵四起。呂布死戰得脫，折了好些人馬；敗回濮陽，堅守不出。,"Dian Wei turned back to his rescue. Luckily Xiahou Yuan came along just then, and the two raised Cao Cao and set him on Xiahou Yuan's horse. And thus they got him out of the burning city. But they had to go through heavy fighting till daybreak.Cao Cao returned to his camp. His officers crowded about his tent, anxious for news of his health. He soon recovered and laughed when he thought of his escape.""I blundered into that fool's trap, but I will have my revenge,"" said he.""Let us have a new plan soon,"" said Guo Jia.""I will turn his trick to my own use. I will spread the false report that I was burned in the fire, and that I died at the fifth watch. He will come to attack as soon as the news gets abroad, and I will have an ambush ready for him in Maling Hills. I will get him this time.""""Really a fine stratagem!"" said Guo Jia.So the soldiers were put into mourning, and the report went everywhere that Cao Cao was dead. And soon Lu Bu heard it, and he assembled his army at once to make a surprise attack, taking the road by the Maling Hills to his enemy's camp.As he was passing the hills, he heard the drums beating for an advance, and the ambushing soldiers leapt out all round him. Only by desperate fighting did he get out of the melee and with a sadly diminished force returned to his camp at Puyang. There he strengthened the fortifications and could not be tempted forth to battle."
是年蝗蟲忽起，食盡禾稻。關東一境，每榖一斛，值錢五十貫，人民相食。曹操因軍中糧盡，引回鄄城暫往。呂布亦引兵出屯山陽就食。因此二處權且罷兵。,"This year locusts suddenly appeared, and they consumed every green blade. There was a famine, and in the northeast grain rose to fifty strings of copper coins a cart. People even took to cannibalism. Cao Cao's army suffered from want, and he marched them to Juancheng. Lu Bu took his troops to Shanyang. Perforce therefore the fighting ceased."
卻說陶謙在徐州，時年已六十三歲，忽然染病，看看沈重，請糜竺、陳登議事。竺曰：「曹兵之去，止為呂布襲兗州故也。今因歲荒罷兵，來春又必至矣。府君兩番欲讓位於劉玄德，時府君尚強健，故玄德不肯受；今病已沈重，正可就此面與之，玄德必不辭矣。」,"In Xuzhou, Imperial Protector Tao Qian, over sixty years of age, suddenly fell seriously ill, and he summoned his confident, Mi Zhu, to his chamber to make arrangements for the future.As to the situation the adviser said, ""Cao Cao abandoned his attack on this place because of his enemy's seizure of Yanzhou; and now they are both keeping the peace solely because of the famine. But Cao Cao will surely renew the attack in the spring. When Liu Bei refused to allow you to vacate office in his favor, you were in full vigor. Now you are ill and weak, and you can make this a reason for retirement. He will not refuse again."""
謙大喜使人來小沛，請劉玄德議軍務。玄德引關、張帶數十騎到徐州，陶謙教請入臥內。玄德問安畢，謙曰：「請玄德公來，不為別事：止因老夫病已危篤，朝夕難保；萬望明公可憐漢家城池為重，受取徐州牌印，老夫死亦瞑目矣！」玄德曰：「君有二子，何不傳之？」謙曰：「長子商，次子應，其才皆不堪任。老夫死後，猶望明公教誨，切勿令掌州事。」玄德曰：「備一身安能當此大任？」謙曰：「某舉一人，可為公輔：係北海人，姓孫，名乾，字公祐。此人可使為從事。」又謂糜竺曰：「劉公當世人傑，汝當善事之。」,"So a message was sent to the little garrison town Xiaopei calling Liu Bei to a counsel on military affairs. This brought him with his brothers and a slender escort. He was at once called in to the sick man's chamber. Quickly disposing of the inquiries about his health, Tao Qian soon came to the real object of his call for Liu Bei.""Sir, I asked you to come for the sole reason that I am dangerously ill and likely to die at any time. I look to you, Illustrious Sir, to consider the Hans and their empire as more important than anything else, and so to take over the symbols of office of this region, the commission and the seal, that I may close my eyes in peace.""""You have two sons, why not depute them to relieve you?"" said Liu Bei.""Both lack the requisite talents. I trust you will instruct them after I have gone, but do not let them have the guidance of affairs.""""But I am unequal to so great a charge.""""I will recommend to you one who could assist you. He is Sun Qian from Beihai who could be appointed to some post.""Turning to Mi Zhu, Tao Qian said, ""The noble Liu Bei here is the most prominent man of the time, and you should serve him well."""
玄德終是推託，陶謙以手指心而死。眾軍舉哀畢，即捧牌印交送玄德。玄德固辭。次日，徐州百姓，擁擠府前哭拜曰：「劉使君若不領此郡，我等皆不能安生矣！」關、張二公亦再三相勸。玄德乃許權領徐州事；使孫乾、糜竺為輔，陳登為幕官；盡取小沛軍馬入城，出榜安民；一面安排喪事。玄德與大小軍士，盡皆挂孝，大設祭奠。祭畢，葬於黃河之原。將陶謙遺表，申奏朝廷。,"Still would Liu Bei have put from him such a post, but just then the Imperial Protector, pointing to his heart to indicate his sincerity, passed away.When the ceremonial wailing of the officials was over, the insignia of office were brought to Liu Bei. But he would have none of them. The following days the inhabitants of the town and country around crowded into the state residence, bowing and with tears, calling upon Liu Bei to receive the charge.""If you do not, we cannot live in peace!"" said they.To these requests his brothers added their persuasion, till at length he consented to assume the administrative duties. He forthwith appointed Sun Qian and Mi Zhu as his Advisers, and Chen Deng his Secretary. He moved his army from Xiaopei to Xuzhou City, and he put forth proclamations to reassure the people.He also attended to the burial ceremonies; he and all his army dressing in mourning. After the fullest sacrifices and ceremonies, a burial place for the late Imperial Protector was found close to the source of the Yellow River. The dead man's testament was forwarded to court."
操在鄄城，知陶謙已死，劉玄德領徐州牧，大怒曰：「我讎未報，汝不費半箭之功，坐得徐州！吾必先殺劉備，後戮謙屍，以雪先君之怨！」即傳號令，剋日起兵去打徐州。荀彧入諫曰：「昔高祖保關中，光武據河內，皆深根固本，以正天下。進足以勝敵，退足以堅守，故雖有困，終濟大業。明公本首事兗州，且河、濟乃天下之要地，是亦昔之關中、河內也。今若取徐州，多留兵則不足用，少留兵則呂布乘虛寇之，是無兗州也。若徐州不得，明公安所歸乎？今陶謙雖死，已有劉備守之。徐州之民，既已服備，必助備死戰。明公棄兗州面取徐州，是棄大而就小，去本而求末，以安而易危也：願熟思之。」操曰：「今歲荒乏糧，軍士坐守於此，終非良策。」彧曰：「不如東略陳地，使軍就食；汝南、潁川，黃巾餘黨何儀、黃劭等，劫掠州郡，多有金帛、糧食。此等賊徒，又容易破。破而取其糧，以養三軍，朝廷喜，百姓悅，乃順天之事也。」,"The news of the events in Xuzhou duly reached the ears of Cao Cao, then in Juancheng.Said he, angrily, ""I have missed my revenge. This Liu Bei has simply stepped into command of the region without expending half an arrow: He sat still and attained his desire. But I will put him to death and then dig up Tao Qian's corpse in revenge for the death of my noble father!""Orders were issued for the army to prepare for a new campaign against Xuzhou.But Adviser Xun Yu remonstrated with Cao Cao, saying, ""The Supreme Ancestor secured the Land Within the Passes and his illustrious successor on the throne, Liu Xiu, took Henei. They both first consolidated their position whereby they could command the entire empire. Their whole progress was from success to success. Hence they accomplished their great designs in spite of difficulties.""Illustrious Sir, your Land Within the Passes and your Henei are Yanzhou and the Yellow River, which you had first, and which is of the utmost strategic point of the empire. If you undertake this expedition against Xuzhou leaving many troops here for defense, you will not accomplish your design; if you leave too few, Lu Bu will fall upon us. And finally if you lose this and fail to gain Xuzhou, whither will you retire? That region is not vacant. Although Tao Qian has gone, Liu Bei holds it; and since the people support him, they will fight to the death for him. To abandon this place for that is to exchange the great for the small, to barter the trunk for the branches, to leave safety and run into danger. I would implore you to reflect well.""Cao Cao replied, ""It is not a good plan to keep soldiers idle here during such scarcity.""""If that is so, it would be more advantageous to attack the eastern counties of Chencheng, Yingchuan, and Runan, and feed your army on their supplies. The remnants of the Yellow Scarves, He Yi and Huang Shao, are there with stores and treasures of all kinds that they have amassed by plundering wherever they could. Rebels of their stamp are easily broken. Break them, and you can feed your army with their grain. Moreover, both the court and the common people will join in blessing you."""
操喜，從之，乃留夏侯惇、曹仁守鄄城等處，自引兵略陳地，次及汝、潁。黃巾何儀、黃劭知曹兵到，引眾來迎，會於羊山。時賊兵雖眾，都是狐群狗黨，並無隊伍行列。操令強弓硬弩射住，令典韋出馬。何儀令副元師出戰，不三合，被典韋一戟剌於馬下。操引眾乘勢趕過羊山下寨。,"This new design appealed strongly to Cao Cao, and he quickly began his preparations to carry it out. He left Xiahou Dun and Cao Ren to guard Juancheng, while his main body, under his own command, marched to seize Chencheng. This done they went to Runan and Yingchuan.Now when the Yellow Scarves leaders, He Yi and Huang Shao, knew that Cao Cao was approaching. They came out in a great body to oppose him. They met at Goat Hill. Though the rebels were numerous, they were a poor lot, a mere pack of beasts without organization and lacking discipline. Cao Cao ordered his strong archers and vigorous crossbowmen to keep them in check.Dian Wei was sent out to challenge. The rebel leaders chose a Second-in-Command champion for their side, who rode out and was vanquished in the third bout. Then Cao Cao's army pushed forward, and they made a camp at Goat Hill."
次日，黃劭自引軍來。陣圓處，一將步行出戰，頭裏黃巾，身披綠襖，手提鐵棒，大叫：「我乃截天夜叉何曼也！誰敢與我廝鬥？」曹洪見了，大喝一聲，飛身下馬，提刀步出。兩下向陣前廝殺，四五十合，勝負不分。曹洪詐敗而走，何曼趕來；洪用拖刀背砍計，轉身一跳，砍中何曼，再復一刀，殺死。李典乘勢飛馬直入賊陣。黃劭不及隄備，被李典生擒活捉過來。曹兵掩殺賊眾，奪其金帛糧食無數。何儀勢孤，引數百騎奔走葛陂。正行之間，山背後撞出一軍。為頭一個壯士，身長八尺，腰大十圍；手提大刀，截住去路。何儀挺鎗出迎，只一合，被那壯士活挾過去。餘眾著忙，皆下馬受縳，被壯士盡驅入葛陂塢中。,"The following day the rebel Huang Shao himself led forth his army and made his battle array along a circle. A leader advanced on foot to offer combat. He wore a yellow turban on his head and a green robe. His weapon was an iron mace.He shouted, ""I am He Man, the devil who shoots across the sky. Who dare fight with me?""Cao Hong uttered a great shout and jumped from the saddle to accept the challenge. Sword in hand he advanced on foot and the two engaged in fierce combat in the face of both armies. They exchanged some fifty blows, neither gaining the advantage. Then Cao Hong feigned defeat and ran away. He Man went after him. Just as he closed, Cao Hong tried a feint and then suddenly wheeling about, wounded his adversary. Another slash, and He Man lay dead.At once Li Dian dashed forward into the midst of the Yellow Scarves and laid hands on the rebel chief Huang Shao whom he carried off captive. Cao Cao's troops then set on and scattered the rebels. The spoil of treasure and food was immense.The other rebel leader, He Yi, fled with a few hundred horsemen toward Gepei Hills. But while on their road thither there suddenly appeared a force led by a certain swashbuckler. This bravo was a well-built man, thickset and stout. With a waist ten spans in girth. He used a long sword.He barred the way of retreat. He Yi set his spear and rode toward him. But at the first encounter the bravo caught He Yi under his arm and bore He Yi off a prisoner. All the rebels were terror-stricken, dropped from their horses and allowed themselves to be bound. Then the victor drove them like cattle into an enclosure with high banks."
卻說典韋追襲何儀到葛陂，壯士引軍迎住。典韋曰：「汝亦黃巾賊耶？」壯士曰：「黃巾數百騎，盡被我擒在塢內！」韋曰：「何不獻出？」壯士曰：「你若贏得手中寶刀，我便獻出！」韋大怒，挺雙戟向前來戰。兩個從辰至午，不分勝負，各自少歇。不一時，那壯士又出搦戰，典韋亦出。直戰到黃昏，各因馬乏暫止。典韋手下軍士，飛報曹操。操大驚，忙引眾將來看。,"Presently Dian Wei, still pursuing the rebels, reached Gepei Hills. The swashbuckler went out to meet him.""Are you also a Yellow Scarves rebel?"" said Dian Wei.""I have some hundreds of them prisoners in an enclosure here.""""Why not bring them out?"" said Dian Wei.""I will if you win this sword from my hand.""This annoyed Dian Wei who attacked him. They engaged and the combat lasted for two long hours and then was still undecided. Both rested a while. The swashbuckler was the first to recover and renewed the challenge. They fought till dusk and then, as their horses were quite spent, the combat was once more suspended.In the meantime some of Dian Wei's men had run off to tell the story of this wondrous fight to Cao Cao who hastened in amazement, followed by many officers to watch it and see the result."
次日，出壯士又出搦戰。操見其人威風凜凜，心中暗喜，分付典韋，今日且詐敗。韋領命出戰；戰到三十合，敗走回陣。壯士趕到陣門中，弓弩射回。操急引軍退五里，密使人掘下陷坑，暗伏鉤手。次日，再令典韋引百餘騎出。壯士笑曰：「敗將何敢復來！」便縱馬接戰。典韋略戰數合，便回馬走。壯士只顧望前趕來，不隄防連人帶馬，都落於坑之內，被鉤手縳來見曹操。操下帳叱退軍士，親解其縳，急取衣衣之，命坐，問其鄉貫姓名。,"Next day the unknown warrior rode out again, and Cao Cao saw him. In Cao Cao's heart he rejoiced to see such a doughty hero and desired to gain his services. So Cao Cao bade Dian Wei feign defeat.Dian Wei rode out in answer to the challenge, and some thirty bouts were fought. Then Dian Wei turned and fled toward his own side. The bravo followed and came quite close. But a flight of arrows drove him away.Cao Cao hastily drew off his men for one and a half miles and then secretly sent a certain number to dig a pitfall and sent troops armed with hooks to lie in ambush.The following day Dian Wei was sent out with one hundred horse. His adversary nothing loath came to meet Dian Wei.""Why does the defeated leader venture forth again?"" cried he laughing.The swashbuckler spurred forward to join battle, but Dian Wei, after a faint show of fighting, turned his horse and rode away. His adversary intent upon capture, took no care, and he and his horse all blundered into the pitfall. The hookmen took him captive, bound him, and carried him before Cao Cao.As soon as he saw the prisoner, Cao Cao advanced from his tent, sent away the soldiers, and with his own hands loosened the leader's bonds. Then he brought out clothing and dressed him, bade him be seated and asked who he was and whence he came."
壯士曰：「我乃譙國譙縣人也：姓許，名褚，字仲康。向遭寇亂，聚宗族數百人，築堅於塢中以禦之。一日寇至，吾令眾人多取石子準備，吾親自飛石擊之，無不中者，寇乃退去。又一日寇至，塢中無糧，遂與賊和，約以耕牛換米。米已送到，賊驅牛至塢外，牛皆奔走回還，被我雙手掣二牛尾，倒行百餘步。賊大驚，不敢取牛而走：因此保守此處無事。」操曰：「吾聞大名久矣，還肯降否？」褚曰：「固所願也。」遂招宗族數百人俱降。操拜許褚為都尉，賞勞甚厚。隨將何儀、黃劭斬訖。汝、潁悉平。,"""I am named Xu Chu. I am from Qiao. When the rebellion broke out, my relatives and I, numbered some hundreds, built a stronghold within a rampart for protection. One day the robbers came, but I had stones ready for them. I told my relatives to keep on bringing them up to me and I threw them, hitting somebody every time I threw. This drove off the robbers. Another day they came, and we were short of grain. So I agreed with them to an exchange of plow oxen against grain. They delivered the grain and were driving away the oxen when the beasts took fright and tore off to their pens. I seized two of oxen by the tail, one with each hand, and hauled them backwards a hundred or so paces. The robbers were so amazed that they thought no more about oxen but went their way. So they never troubled us again.""""I have heard of your mighty exploits,"" said Cao Cao. ""Will you join my army?""""That is my strongest desire,"" said Xu Chu.So Xu Chu called up his clan, some hundreds in all, and they formally submitted to Cao Cao. Xu Chu received the rank of General and got ample rewards. The two rebel leaders, He Yi and Huang Shao, were executed. Runan and Yingchuan were now perfectly pacified."
曹操班師，曹仁、夏侯惇接見，言近日細作報說：兗州薛蘭、李封軍士皆出擄掠，城邑空虛，可引得勝之兵攻之，一鼓可下。操遂引軍逕奔兗州。薛蘭、李封出其不意，只得引兵出城迎戰。許褚曰：「吾願取此二人，以為贄見之禮。」操大喜，遂令出戰，李封使畫戟，向前來迎。交馬兩合，許褚斬李封於馬下。薛蘭急走回陣，弔橋邊李典攔住；薛蘭不敢回城，引軍投鉅野而去；卻被呂虔飛馬趕來，一箭射於馬下，軍皆潰散。,"Cao Cao withdrew his army and went back to Juancheng.Xiahou Dun and Cao Ren came out to welcome him, and they told him, ""Scouts report that Yanzhou City has been left defenseless. Lu Bu's generals, Xue Lan and Li Fang, have given up all its garrison to plundering the surrounding country. We must act without loss of time. With our soldiers fresh from victory, the city will fall at a tap of the drum.""So Cao Cao marched the army straight to the city. An attack was quite unexpected but the two leaders, Xue Lan and Li Fang, hurried out their few soldiers to fight.Xu Chu, the latest recruit, said, ""I wish to capture these two and make them an introductory gift!""The task was given him, and he rode forth. Li Fang with his halberd advanced to meet Xu Chu. The combat was brief as Li Fang fell in the second bout. His colleague Xue Lan retired with his troops. But he found the drawbridge had been seized by Li Dian, so that he could not get shelter within the city. Xue Lan led his men toward Juye. But Lu Qian pursued and killed him with an arrow. His soldiers scattered to the four directions."
曹操復得兗州，程昱便請進兵取濮陽。操令許褚、典韋為先鋒，夏侯惇、夏侯淵為左軍，李典、樂進為右軍，操自領中軍，于禁、呂虔為合後。兵至濮陽，呂布欲自將出迎，陳宮諫：「不可出戰。待眾將聚會後方可。」呂布曰：「吾怕誰來？」遂不聽宮言，引兵出陣，橫戟大罵。許褚便出。鬥二十合，不分勝負。操曰：「呂布非一人可勝。」便差典韋助戰，兩將夾攻。左邊夏侯惇、夏侯淵，右邊李典、樂進齊到，六員將共攻呂布。布遮攔不住，撥馬回城。城上田氏，見布敗回，急令人拽起弔橋。布大叫：「開門！」田氏曰：「吾已降曹將軍。」,"And thus Yanzhou was recaptured. Next Cheng Yu proposed an expedition to take Puyang. Cao Cao marched his army out in perfect order. The Van Leaders were Dian Wei and Xu Chu; Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan led the left wing; Li Dian and Yue Jing led the right wing; Yu Jin and Lu Qian guarded the rear. Cao Cao himself commanded the center.When they approached Puyang, Lu Bu wished to go out in person and alone to attack, but his adviser Chen Gong protested, saying, ""General, you should not go out until the arrival of the other officers.""""Whom do I fear?"" said Lu Bu.So he threw caution to the winds and went out of the city. He met his foes and began to revile them. The redoubtable Xu Chu went to fight with him, but after twenty bouts neither combatant was any the worse.""He is not the sort that one man can overcome,"" said Cao Cao.And he sent Dian Wei to attack Lu Bu from another direction. Lu Bu stood the double onslaught. Soon after the flank commanders joined in —-Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan attacking the left; Li Dian and Yue Jing surrounding the right. Lu Bu had six opponents. These proved really too many for him so he turned his horse and rode back to the city.But when the members of the Tian family saw him coming back beaten, they raised the drawbridge.Lu Bu shouted, ""Open the gates! Let me in!""But the Tians said, ""We have gone over to Cao Cao!"""
布大罵，引軍奔定陶而去。陳宮急開東門，保護呂布老小出城。操遂得濮陽，恕田氏舊日之罪。劉曄曰：「呂布乃猛虎也，今日困乏，不可少容。」操令劉曄等守濮陽，自己引軍趕至定陶。時呂布與張邈、張超盡在城中，高順、張遼、臧霸、侯成巡海打糧未回。操軍至定陶，連日不戰，引軍退四十里下寨。正值濟郡麥熟，操即令軍割麥為食。細作報知呂布，布引軍趕來。將近操寨，見左邊一望林木茂盛，恐有伏兵而回。,"This was hard to hear and the beaten man abused them roundly before he left. Chen Gong got away through the east gate taking with him the general's family.Thus Puyang came into Cao Cao's hands, and for their present services the Tian family were pardoned their previous fault.However, Liu Ye said, ""Lu Bu is a savage beast. If let alive, he will be a great danger. Hunt him down!""Liu Ye was ordered to keep Puyang. Wherefore Cao Cao determined to follow Lu Bu to Dingtao whither he had gone for refuge.Lu Bu, Zhang Miao, and Zhang Chao were assembled in the city. Gao Shun and other generals were out foraging. Cao Cao army arrived but did not attack for many days, and presently he withdrew fifteen miles and made a stockade. It was the time of harvest, and he set his soldiers to cut the wheat for food. The spies reported this to Lu Bu who came over to see. But when he saw that Cao Cao's stockade lay near a thick wood, he feared an ambush and retired."
操知布軍回去，乃謂諸將曰：「布疑林中有伏兵耳，可多插旌旗於林中以疑之。寨西一帶，長提無水，可盡伏精兵。明日呂布必來燒林，堤中軍斷其後，布可擒矣。」於是止留鼓手五十人於寨中擂鼓；將村中擄來男女在寨內吶喊。精兵多伏堤中。,"Cao Cao heard that Lu Bu had come and gone and guessed the reason. ""He fears an ambush in the wood,"" said Cao Cao. ""We will set up flags there and deceive him. There is a long embankment near the camp, but behind it there is no water. There we will lay an ambush to fall upon Lu Bu when he comes to burn the wood.""So Cao Cao hid all his soldiers behind the embankment except half a hundred drummers, and he got together many peasants to loiter within the stockade as though it was not empty."
卻說呂布回報陳宮。宮曰：「操多詭計，不可輕敵。」布曰：「吾用火攻，可破伏兵。」乃留陳宮、高順守城。布次日引大軍來，遙見林中有旗，驅兵大進，四面於火，竟無一人；欲投寨中，卻聞鼓聲大震。正自疑惑不定，忽然寨後一彪軍出，呂布縱馬趕來。砲聲響處，堤內伏兵盡出：夏侯惇，夏侯淵，許褚，典韋，李典，樂進，驟馬殺來。呂布料敵不過，落荒而走。從將成廉，被樂進一箭射死。布軍三停去了一停，，敗卒回報陳宮。宮曰：「空城難守，不若急去。」遂與高順保著呂布老小，棄定陶而走。曹操將得勝之兵，殺入城中，勢如破竹。張超自焚，張邈投袁術去了。山東一境，盡被曹操所得。安民修城，不在話下。,"Lu Bu rode back and told Chen Gong what he had seen.""This Cao Cao is very crafty and full of wiles,"" said the adviser. ""Do not act.""""I will use fire this time and burn out his ambush,"" said Lu Bu.Next morning Lu Bu rode out, and there he saw flags flying everywhere in the wood. He ordered his troops forward to set fire on all sides. But to his surprise no one rushed out to make for the stockade. Still he heard the beating of drums and doubt filled his mind. Suddenly he saw a party of soldiers move out from the shelter of the stockade. He galloped over to see what it meant.Then the signal-bombs exploded: Out rushed the troops and all their leaders dashed forward. Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Xu Chu, Dian Wei, Li Dian, and Yue Jing all attacked at once. Lu Bu was at a loss and fled into the open country. One of his generals, Cheng Lian, was killed by an arrow of Yue Jing. Two thirds of his troops were lost, and the beaten remainder went to tell Chen Gong what had come to pass.""We had better leave,"" said Chen Gong. ""An empty city cannot be held.""So Chen Gong and Gao Shun, taking their chief's family with them, abandoned Dingtao. When Cao Cao's soldiers got into the city, they met with no resistance. Zhang Chao committed suicide by burning himself. Zhang Miao fled to Yuan Shu.Thus the whole northeast fell under the power of Cao Cao. He immediately tranquilized the people and rebuilt the cities and their defenses (AD 195)."
卻說呂布正走，逢諸將皆回。陳宮亦已尋著。布曰：「吾軍雖少，尚可破曹。」遂再引軍來。正是：兵家勝敗真常事，捲甲重來未可知。不知呂布勝負如何，且聽下文分解。,"Lu Bu in his retreat fell in with his generals, and Chen Gong also rejoined him, so that he was by no means broken.""I have but a small army,"" said Lu Bu, ""but still enough to break Cao Cao!""And so he retook the backward road. Indeed:Thus does fortune alternate, victory and defeat,The happy conqueror today, tomorrow must retreat?What was the fate of Lu Bu will appear later."
