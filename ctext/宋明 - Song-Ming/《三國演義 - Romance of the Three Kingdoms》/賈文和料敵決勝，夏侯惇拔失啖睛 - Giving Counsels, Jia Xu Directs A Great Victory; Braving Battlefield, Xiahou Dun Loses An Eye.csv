卻說賈詡料知曹操之意，便欲將計就計而行，乃謂張繡曰：「某在城上，見曹操遶城而觀者三日。他見城東南角磚土之色，新舊不等，鹿角多半毀壞，意將從此處攻進；卻虛去西北上積草，詐為聲勢，欲哄我撤兵守西北，彼乘夜黑，必爬東南角而進也。」繡曰：「然則奈何？」詡曰：「此易事耳。來日可令精壯之兵，飽食輕裝，盡藏於東南房屋內，卻教百姓假扮軍士，虛守西北，夜間任他在東南角上爬城。俟其爬進城時，一聲砲響，伏兵齊起，操可擒矣。」,"Jia Xu, as he had guessed the enemy's intention, had also devised a countermove. So he went to his chief and said, ""I saw Cao Cao very carefully reconnoitering round about the city. He certainly noticed that the southeast corner of the wall had been lately restored with mud bricks of a different kind, and that the fencing barrier is badly out of repair. He will try to effect an entrance there. Wherefore he is making a feint attack at the opposite point. He is piling up straw and making ostentatious preparations whereby to cajole us into withdrawing from the real point of attack to defend the northwest. His troops will scale the walls in the darkness and try to enter at the southeast.""""Supposing your surmise correct, what do you advise?"" asked Zhang Xiu.""The countermove is plain. You issue an order for our best and bravest soldiers to fill their bellies, to take only the lightest outfit and conceal themselves in the houses near the southeast corner. Then disguise the townspeople as soldiers and send them to pretend to defend the northwest. Tonight we will let the enemy climb up the walls and enter the city and, once they are fairly within, give the signal and the concealed soldiers will rush out upon them. We may even capture Cao Cao himself."""
繡喜從其計。早有探馬報曹操，說張繡盡撤兵在西北角上，吶喊守城，東南卻甚空虛。操曰：「中吾計矣！」遂命軍中密備鍬钁，爬城器具，日間只引軍攻西北角；至二更時分，卻領精兵於東南角上爬入濠去，砍開鹿角。城中全無動靜，眾軍一齊擁入。只聽得一聲砲響，伏兵四起。曹軍急退，背後張繡親驅勇壯殺來。曹軍大敗，退出城外，奔走數十里。張繡直殺至天明方收軍入城。曹操計點敗軍，已折五萬餘人，失去輜重無數。呂虔、于禁俱各被傷。,"The stratagem was decided upon. Soon the scouts told Cao Cao: ""The defenders of the city have moved to the northwest where noisy preparations for defense are going on. The opposite corner is left undefended.""""They have fallen into my trap!"" said Cao Cao gleefully. He ordered his troops to prepare shovels and hooks and all the gear needed for scaling walls, and all day they kept up the attack on the northwest angle. But at the second watch they dispatched the veterans to the opposite corner, where they climbed the wall, broke up the fencing barrier, and got into the city apparently without disturbing any of the guards. There was no sign of life anywhere as they entered. But just as they were leaving the wall, suddenly a bomb exploded and they found themselves in an ambush. They turned to retire, but Zhang Xiu immediately fell on the rear and began a slaughter. Cao Cao's troops were totally defeated and fled out of the gate into the country. Zhang Xiu kept up the pursuit till daybreak, when he retired into the city again. Cao Cao then rallied his army and mustered his soldiers. He had lost fifty thousand and much baggage, while two of his generals, Lu Qian and Yu Jin were wounded."
卻說賈詡見操敗走，急勸張繡遺書劉表，使起兵截其後路。表得書，即欲起兵，忽探馬報孫策屯兵湖口。蒯良曰：「策屯兵湖口，乃曹操之計也。今操新敗，若不乘勢擊之，後必有患。」表乃令黃祖堅守隘口，自己統兵至安眾縣截操後路；一面約會張繡。繡知表兵已起，即同賈詡引兵襲操。,"Cao Cao being thus worsted, Jia Xu advised Zhang Xiu to write off to Liu Biao to cut off Cao Cao's retreat so that he might be utterly destroyed. Liu Biao was preparing an army for this purpose, when a scout came to say that Sun Ce had encamped in the river at Hukou. Kuai Liang said, ""This move of Sun Ce in the river is part of Cao Cao's strategy, and there will be never-ending regret if Cao Cao is allowed to escape. An immediate expedition is necessary."" Wherefore Liu Biao moved out with his army to Anzhong to block Cao Cao, leaving Huang Zu to hold Jingzhou's points of vantage. Zhang Xiu, having been informed of the movement of Liu Biao, went with Jia Xu to smite Cao Cao on the rear."
且說操軍緩緩而行，至襄城到淯水，操忽於馬上放聲大哭。眾驚問其故。操曰：「吾思去年於此地折了吾大將典韋，不由不哭耳！」因即下令屯住軍馬，大設祭筵，弔奠典韋亡魂。操親自拈香哭拜，三軍無不感嘆。祭典韋畢，方祭姪曹安民及長子曹昂，并祭陣亡軍士；連那匹射死的大宛馬，也都致祭。,"In the meantime Cao Cao's army, marching very leisurely, had arrived at Xiangyang. Walking one day beside River Yu, he suddenly uttered a great cry, and when his officers asked the reason thereof, he replied, ""I remembered that here, only a year ago, I lost my great general: Dian Wei. Is that not a reason to grieve?""Thereupon Cao Cao gave orders to halt, while he should make a great sacrifice and mourn for his lost leader. At the ceremony he himself burned incense and wailed and prostrated himself. The army was much affected by his devotion. After the sacrifices to the lost hero, he sacrificed to the names of his nephew Cao Amin and his eldest son Cao Ang, both of whom had died at the same time. He also sacrificed to his lost soldiers and even to his Dawan steed which had been killed by an arrow."
次日，忽荀彧差人報說：「劉表助張繡屯兵安眾，截吾歸路。」操答彧書曰：「吾日行數里，非不知賊來追我，然吾計劃已定，若到安眾，破繡必矣。君等勿疑。」便催軍行至安眾縣界。劉表軍已守險要，張繡隨後引軍趕來。操乃令眾軍黑夜鑿險開道，暗伏奇兵。,"Next day Xun Yu wrote to tell Cao Cao that Liu Biao had gone to help Zhang Xiu and was camped at Anzhong, thereby cutting his road of retreat. Cao Cao replied to the letter, saying, ""I have been marching only a short distance each day and of course knew of the pursuit. But my plans are laid and, as I am near Anzhong, my enemy will be broken. You need not have any fears.""Then Cao Cao hastened his march till he came near where Liu Biao had taken position. Zhang Xiu still shortened the distance. Cao Cao ordered his men during the night to open a secret way through a pass, where he laid an ambush."
及天色微明，劉表、張繡軍會合，見操兵少，疑操遁去，俱引兵入險擊之。操縱奇兵出，大破兩家之兵。曹兵出了安眾界口，於隘外下寨。劉表、張繡各整敗兵相見。表曰：「何期反中曹操奸計！」繡曰：「容再圖之！」於是兩軍集於安眾。,"With the first light of dawn Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu met. As Cao Cao's force looked small, they thought he had retired so they boldly advanced into the pass to smite him. Then the ambush was opened, and both the attackers' forces were cut up. The fighting ended; Cao Cao's soldiers went outside the pass and encamped. The two leaders on the other side restored order among their beaten troops and then held a conference.""How could we have foreseen such a wicked ruse?"" said Liu Biao.""Let us try again,"" said Zhang Xiu. Wherefore they joined forces at Anzhong."
且說荀彧探知袁紹欲興兵犯許都，星夜馳書報曹操。操得書心慌，即日回兵。細作報知張繡，繡欲追之。賈詡曰：「不可追也，追之必敗。」劉表曰：「今日不追，坐失機會矣。」力勸繡引軍萬餘同往追之。約行十餘里，趕上曹軍後隊。曹軍奮力接戰，繡、表兩軍大敗而還。繡謂詡曰：「不用公言，果有此敗。」詡曰：「今可整兵再往追之。」繡與表俱曰：「今已敗，奈何復追？」詡曰：「今番追去，必獲大勝，如其不然，請斬吾首。」繡信之。劉表疑慮，不肯同往。繡乃自引一軍往追，操兵果然大敗，軍馬輜重，連路散棄而走。,"But Xun Yu discovered through his spies that Yuan Shao was preparing an attack on Capital Xuchang, so he at once wrote to Cao Cao who, much disturbed by this news, set out homeward right away. When Zhang Xiu heard this through his scouts, he wished to follow the retreating army.Jia Xu opposed it and said, ""It will lead to a defeat.""However, Liu Biao said, ""It is wrong to lose such a chance.""And so finally pursuit was decided upon. They had not marched more than four miles before they came upon Cao Cao's rearguard, who fought with great vigor and bravery so that the pursuers were beaten off and went home discomfited.Zhang Xiu said to Jia Xu, ""This defeat comes from my not following your advice.""""Now set your army in order and pursue,"" said Jia Xu.""But we have just suffered defeat!"" cried both leaders. ""Do you now counsel pursuit?""""Yes, and the result will be a great victory if you go now. I will venture my head on that,"" said Jia Xu.Zhang Xiu had confidence, but Liu Biao was afraid and would not accompany him. So one army only started in pursuit. However, this was enough. Cao Cao's rear-guard was thoroughly routed and abandoned their wagons and their baggage in their hasty flight."
繡正往前追趕，忽山後一彪軍擁出。繡不敢前追，收軍回安眾。劉表問賈詡曰：「前以精兵追退兵，而公曰必敗；後以敗卒擊勝兵，而公曰必克；究竟悉如公言，何其事不同而皆驗也？願公明教我。」詡曰：「此易知耳。將軍雖善用兵，非曹操敵手。操軍雖敗，必有勁將為殿，以防追兵；我兵雖銳，不能敵之也；故知必敗。夫操之急於退兵者，必因許都有事；既破我追軍之後，必輕車速回，不復為備；我乘其不備而更追之，故能勝也。」劉表、張繡俱服其高見。詡勸表回荊州，繡守襄城，以為脣齒，兩軍各散。,"Zhang Xiu pursued, but suddenly a troop came out from the shelter of some hills and checked him. Fearful to try further, he hastened back to Anzhong.The other general, Liu Biao, asked the adviser to explain his apparent inconsistency, saying, ""When our veteran and brave soldiers were going to pursue those who retreated, you said our men would lose the day; and when defeated men pursued the victors, you foretold victory. You were right in both cases, but we wish you would enlighten us.""""It is easy to explain. You, Generals, although skilled leaders, are not a match for our enemy. Though Cao Cao had lost a battle, he had able generals to keep the rear and guard against pursuit. Our soldiers are good, but not a match for them. That is how I knew. For as much as Cao Cao's hurried retreat was due to trouble in the capital, and he had beaten off our attack, I knew he would retire at his utmost speed and not take his usual precautions. I ventured to take advantage of his laxity.""Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu could not but affirm his complete understanding of the conditions. On the advice of Jia Xu then Liu Biao returned to Jingzhou, while Zhang Xiu took up his position at Xiangyang so that each strengthened the other as the lips protect the teeth from cold."
且說曹操正行間，聞報後軍為繡所追，急引眾將回身救應。只見繡軍已退，敗兵回告操曰：「若非山後這一路人馬阻住中路，我等皆被擒矣。」操急問何人，那人綽槍下馬，拜見曹操，乃鎮威中郎將，江夏平春人；姓李，名通，字文達。操問何來。通曰：「近守汝南，聞丞相與張繡、劉表戰，特來接應。」操喜，封通為建功侯，守汝南西界，以防表、繡。李通拜謝而去。,"When Cao Cao, during his retreat, heard that his army was being pursued, he hastily turned back to support the rearguard. Then he saw the pursuing army draw off. The soldiers of the beaten rearguard said, ""Had it not been for the troops that came out of the hills, we should all have been lost.""""What troops?"" asked Cao Cao in surprise.The leader of the troops then advanced, slung his spear and, dismounting, made a low obeisance. He was Li Tong, Imperial Commander, from Jiangxia. Cao Cao asked him why he had come.Li Tong replied, ""I was in command at Runan when I heard of the struggle going on, so I came to lend you any help I could.""To show his gratitude, Cao Cao conferred upon Li Tong the title Lord Who Renders High Services, and confirmed him in his command as the defense of Runan against Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu. Then Li Tong expressed his thanks and took his leave."
操還許都，表奏孫策有功，封為討逆將軍，賜爵吳侯，遣使齎詔江東，諭令防剿劉表。操回府，眾官參見畢。荀彧問曰：「丞相緩行至安眾，何以知必勝賊兵？」操曰：「彼退無歸路，必將死戰，吾緩誘之而暗圖之，是以知其必勝也。」,"On his return to the capital, Cao Cao presented a memorial on the good services rendered by Sun Ce, and the Emperor made him Lord of Wu with the title General Who Destroys Rebels. The messenger bearing the decree bore also the order to repress Liu Biao. Cao Cao went to his palace and there received the ceremonial calls of congratulation. These finished, Xun Yu asked, saying, ""You, Sir, marched very leisurely to Anzhong: How came it that you felt certain of victory?""Cao Cao replied, ""My soldiers, who retire and find their retreat cut off, fight vigorously and desperately. I retired slowly to entice the enemy into following whereby I could do as I wished with them. Basing my movements on these considerations I felt secure."""
荀彧拜服。郭嘉入。操曰：「公來何暮也？」嘉袖出一書，白操曰：「袁紹使人致書承相，言欲出兵攻公孫瓚，特來借糧借兵。」操曰：「吾聞紹欲圖許都，今見吾歸，又別生他議。」遂拆書觀之。見其詞意驕慢，乃問嘉曰：「袁紹如此無狀，吾欲討之，恨力不及，如何？」,"Xun Yu bowed his head in admiration. When Guo Jia entered, Cao Cao said, ""Why so late, Sir?""The visitor drew a letter from his sleeve, saying to his master, ""Yuan Shao sends this expressing he desires to send an army to attack Gongsun Zan and wishes you to lend provisions and troops.""""I heard Yuan Shao was going to attack Xuchang. I suppose my return has made him change his intention,"" said Cao Cao. Then he opened the letter and read it. It was couched in very arrogant terms.""Yuan Shao is so exceedingly rude that I will attack him,"" said Cao Cao. ""Only I think I am not quite strong enough. What should be done?"""
嘉曰：「劉項之不敵，公所知也。高祖惟智勝，項羽雖強，終為所擒。今紹有十敗，公有十勝；紹兵雖盛，不足懼也。紹繁禮多儀，公體任自然，此道勝也；紹以逆動，公以順率，此義勝也；桓、靈以來，政失於寬，紹以寬濟，公以猛糾，此治勝也；紹外寬內忌，所任多親戚，公外簡內明，用人惟才，此度勝也；紹多謀少決，公得策輒行，此謀勝也，紹專收名譽，公以至誠待人，此德勝也；紹恤近忽遠，公慮無不周，此仁勝也；紹聽讒惑亂，公浸潤不行，此明勝也；紹是非混淆，公法度嚴明，此文勝也；紹好為虛勢，不知兵要，公以少克眾，用兵如神，此武勝也。─公有此十勝，於以敗紹無難矣。」,"Guo Jia said, ""My lord, you know well who lost, and why, in the conflict between Liu Bang, the Supreme Ancestor, and Xiang Yu, his rival. The former won only by superior wisdom. Xiang Yu was the stronger, but in the end he was overcome. Your rival has ten weak points whereas you have ten strong ones, and, though his army is large, it is not terrible.""Then Guo Jia continued, ""Yuan Shao is overmuch devoted to ceremony and deportment; while you are sympathetic and natural; this is an excellence in conduct. He is antagonistic and drives; you are conciliatory and lead; so you have the advantage of popular approval. For many years the government has been lax, and he makes it more so; you strive vigorously after efficiency; this is the excellence of able administration. He is outwardly liberal but grudging at heart, and too given to nepotism; you appear exacting, but you understand and use people after their ability; this is the advantage of correct appreciation. He is a visionary but lacking in decision; you are a man of prompt decision and direct action; this is an advantage in policy. He loves to gather about him people of renown; you treat people as you find them regardless of their reputation; this is where you excel in moral virtue. He is compassionate to those at hand, but careless about those out of sight; your care is all-embracing; this is where you excel in humanity. He lends a ready ear to calumny and is misled; you may be flooded with evil counsel, but you preserve independence; this is where you excel in perspicacity. His sense of right and wrong is confused; your appreciation is accurate and clear; this is where you excel in administrative capacity. He loves the make-believe force, but is ignorant of military essentials; you would overcome with far inferior numbers as you possess military genius; this is where you excel in war. With your ten superiorities, you will have no difficulty in overcoming Yuan Shao."""
操笑曰：「如公所言，孤何足以當之？」荀彧曰：「郭奉孝十勝十敗之說，正與愚見相合。紹兵雖眾，何足懼耶！」嘉曰：「徐州呂布，實心腹大患。今紹北征公孫瓚，我當乘其遠出，先取呂布，掃除東南，然後圖紹，乃為上計；否則我方攻紹，布必乘虛來犯許都，為害不淺也。」,"""How can I be worth as much as you say?"" said Cao Cao, smiling.""What Guo Jia has said about the ten points in your favor agrees exactly with what I think,"" said Xun Yu. ""Yuan Shao's army is not formidable in spite of its size.""""The real and dangerous enemy is Lu Bu,"" said Guo Jia. ""When Yuan Shao has gone north to destroy Gongsun Zan, we ought to sweep away Lu Bu and so clear away our danger from that side; for if this is not done, our attack on Yuan Shao will be the signal for an attempt on the capital. That would be most serious."""
操然其言，遂議東征呂布。荀彧曰：「可先使人往約劉備，待其回報，方可動兵。」操從之，一面發書與玄德，一面厚遣紹使，奏封紹為大將軍太尉，兼都督冀、青、幽、并四州，密書答之云：「公可討公孫瓚，吾當相助。」紹得書大喜，便進兵攻公孫瓚。,"Cao Cao saw things in the same light as his advisers and began to discuss plans for an attack on Lu Bu. Xun Yu was of opinion that they should first secure the fidelity and aid of Liu Bei. So letters were written, and they waited his assurance before moving a soldier. Then, in order to reassure Yuan Shao, his emissary was treated with great kindness, and a memorial presented to the Emperor asking extra honors for him. Yuan Shao was made Imperial Protector of the four northern regions —-Jizhou, Qingzhou, Youzhou, and Bingzhou. With all this a private letter was written by Cao Cao urging upon him to attack Gongsun Zan and promising assistance. So Yuan Shao's army started."
且說呂布在徐州，每當賓客宴會之際，陳珪父子必盛稱布德。陳宮不悅，乘間告布曰：「陳珪父子面諛將軍，其心不可測，宜善防之。」布怒叱曰：「汝無端獻讒，欲害好人耶？」宮出歎曰：「忠言不入，吾輩必受殃矣。」意欲棄布他往，卻又不忍；又恐被人嗤笑，乃終日悶悶不樂。,"In the meantime the two Chen Deng and Chen Gui were playing their game. At every feast and gathering in Xuzhou, they uttered the most fulsome praises of Lu Bu. Chen Gong was greatly displeased and took an opportunity to talk about them to his master.""They flatter you to your face, but what is in their hearts? You ought to be most carefully on your guard.""""Hold your tongue!"" was the angry reply. ""You are simply slandering them without the slightest excuse. You want to harm good people.""""No ears for loyal words,"" said Chen Gong, as he went away sad at heart, ""and we shall suffer.""He thought seriously of abandoning Lu Bu, but that would be too painful a wrench. Beside he feared people would laugh at him. So the days passed sorrowfully for him."
一日，帶領數騎去小沛地面圍獵解悶，忽見官道上一騎驛馬，飛奔前去。宮疑之，棄了圍場，引從騎從小路趕上，問曰：「汝是何處使命？」那使者知是呂布部下人，慌不能答。陳宮令搜其身，得玄德回答曹操密書一封。宮即連人與書，拿見呂布。布問其故。來使曰：「曹丞相差我往劉豫州處下書，今得回書，不知書中所言何事。」布乃拆書細看。書略曰：,"One day, with a few horsemen, he rode out to the country near Xiaopei to hunt. On the high road he saw a messenger galloping along in hot haste and began to wonder what it might mean. He left the hunt, rode across country, and intercepted the rider.""Where are you from? Who sent you?"" asked Chen Gong.The messenger made no reply for he knew to what party his captors belonged. But they searched him and found a letter, the secret reply to Cao Cao's letter from Liu Bei. The messenger and the letter were both taken straight to Lu Bu. Lu Bu questioned the man, who said, ""The Prime Minister sent me to bear a letter to Imperial Protector Liu Bei. I was now taking back the reply. I know nothing more, and I am ignorant of the contents of the letters.""So Lu Bu tore it open and read:"
奉明命欲圖呂布，敢不夙夜用心？但備兵微將少，不敢輕動。丞相若興大師，備當為前驅。謹嚴兵整甲，專待鈞命。,"""I have received your commands concerning the destruction of Lu Bu, and dare I for a moment venture to disregard them? But my force is weak and I must act with extreme circumspection. If you move your main body, then I will hasten forward, and in the meantime my army shall be got ready and weapons prepared. I await your command."""
呂布見了，大驚曰：「操賊焉敢如此！」遂將使者斬首，先使陳宮、臧霸，結連泰山寇孫觀、吳敦、尹禮、昌豨，東取山東兗州諸郡。令高順、張遼取沛城，攻玄德。令宋憲、魏續西取汝、潁。布自總中軍為三路救應。,"Lu Bu was really alarmed. ""The wretches!"" cried he. ""To dare to act thus!""The unhappy messenger was put to death and countermoves planned. Chen Gong and Zang Ba went to enlist the help of the Taishan Mountains bandits —-Sun Guan, Wu Dun, Yin Li, and Chang Xi —-so that they would take Yanzhou in the East of Huashan Mountains. Gao Shun and Zhang Liao went to attack Liu Bei in Xiaopei. Song Xian and Wei Xu went west to attack Runan and Yingchuan. And Lu Bu took command of a large body of troops ready to afford help wherever needed."
且說高順等引兵出徐州，將至小沛，有人報知玄德。玄德急與眾商議。孫乾曰：「可速告急於曹操。」玄德曰：「誰可去許都告急？」階下一人出曰：「某願往。」視之，乃玄德同郡人，姓簡，名雍，字憲和，現為玄德幕賓。玄德即修書付簡雍，使星夜赴許都求援；一面整頓守城器具。玄德自守南門，孫乾守北門，雲長守西門，張飛守東門，令糜竺與其弟糜芳守護中軍，原來糜竺有一妹，嫁與玄德為次妻。玄德與他兄弟有郎舅之親，故令其守中軍保護妻小。,"The departure of the army under Gao Shun against Xiaopei was reported to Liu Bei, who assembled his officers at a council. Sun Qian advised sending a message to the capital to inform Cao Cao of their danger. In response to the chief's call, Jian Yong, a fellow townsman of Liu Bei, offered to take the message. Up to that moment Jian Yong had served as a secretary. So a letter was written, and Jian Yong set out at once on his journey.Then preparations were made for defense: Liu Bei commanding at the south gate; Sun Qian at the north gate; Guan Yu at the west gate; and Zhang Fei at the east gate. Mi Zhu and his brother Mi Fang commanded the family guard in the center.The two Mis were put in command of the house guard because they were Liu Bei's brothers-in-law; Liu Bei had taken a sister of Mi Zhu as a second wife. Hence they were suitable men to guard the family."
高順軍至，玄德在敵樓上問曰：「吾與奉先無隙，何故引兵至此？」順曰：「你結連曹操，欲害吾主，今事已露，何不就縛？」言訖，便麾軍攻城。玄德閉門不出。次日，張遼引兵攻打西門。雲長從城上謂之曰：「公儀表非俗，何故失身於賊？」張遼低頭不語。雲長知此人有忠義之氣，更不以惡言相加，亦不出戰。,"In due course Gao Shun came to the south gate. Liu Bei ascended the tower and said, ""I have no quarrel with your master, why do you come here with an army?""""You have plotted with Cao Cao to injure my master as we know now: Why should I not bind you?""So saying Gao Shun gave the signal to attack. But Liu Bei did not go out to repulse Gao Shun; he only kept the gate fast closed. Soon after, Zhang Liao led an attack on the west gate, then kept by Guan Yu, who addressed Zhang Liao from the wall.""You are too good a man to waste yourself on rebels,"" said Guan Yu.Zhang Liao hung his head and made no reply. Guan Yu knew that Zhang Liao had a sound heart and high principles and said no more, as he was unwilling to wound Zhang Liao. Nor did he go out to attack."
遼引兵退至東門，張飛便出迎戰。早有人報知關公。關公急來東門看時，只見張飛方出城，張遼軍已退。飛欲追趕，關公急召入城。飛曰：「彼懼而退，何不追之？」關公曰：「此人武藝不在你我之下。因我以正言感之，頗有自悔之心，故不與我等戰耳。」飛乃悟，只令士卒堅守城門，更不出戰。,"Zhang Liao then drew off and proceeded to the east gate, and Zhang Fei went out to give battle. Soon it was told Guan Yu, who came over quickly. He saw Zhang Fei going out, but Zhang Liao was already withdrawing. Zhang Fei wished to pursue, but his brother held him back.""He is afraid and so has gone away. It would be best to pursue,"" said Zhang Fei.""No,"" said Guan Yu. ""As a warrior he is not inferior to either of us, but I have spoken a few straight words, and he has sunk deep. He is repentant and that is why he will not meet us.""So Zhang Fei understood, and the gates were shut and orders given for careful defense."
卻說簡雍至許都見曹操，具言前事。操即聚眾謀士議曰：「吾欲攻呂布，不憂袁紹掣肘，只恐劉表、張繡擾其後耳。」荀攸曰：「二人新破，未敢輕動。呂布驍勇，若更結連袁術，縱橫淮、泗，急難圖矣。」郭嘉曰：「今可乘其初叛，眾心未附疾往擊之。」,"When Jian Yong, Liu Bei's messenger, reached the capital, he saw Cao Cao and told him what had happened. The advisers were called to discuss a plan.Cao Cao said, ""I wish to attack Lu Bu. I fear not Yuan Shao, but Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu may attack me in the rear.""Xun You, the nephew of Xun Yu, replied, ""Both these latter have been too recently defeated to do anything so rash. But Lu Bu is a bold fighting man, and if he joined forces with Yuan Shu and they set themselves to conquer River Huai and River Si, the problem would he difficult.""Then spoke Guo Jia, ""Let us take advantage of the moment before they have fully made up their mind. Smite before they are fully prepared."""
操從其言，即命夏侯惇與夏侯淵、呂虔、李典領兵五萬先行，自統大軍陸續進發，簡雍隨行。早有探馬報知高順。順飛報呂布。布先令侯成、郝萌、曹性引二百餘騎接應高順，使離沛城三十里去迎曹軍，自引大軍隨後接應。,"And Cao Cao did so. An army of fifty thousand were sent in advance with four commanders —-Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Lu Qian, and Li Dian. Cao Cao commanded the Center Army, which marched by divisions, and Jian Yong brought up the rear.Soon the scouts informed Gao Shun. He sent flying messengers to Lu Bu, who detached two hundred horse with Hou Cheng, Cao Xing, and He Meng to assist him. Gao Shun posted this reinforcement and his army about ten miles from Xiaopei to meet Cao Cao's army. Lu Bu and the main army also followed close."
玄德在小沛城中見高順退去，知是曹家兵至，乃只留孫乾守城，糜竺、糜芳守家，自己卻與關、張二公，提兵盡出城外，分頭下寨，接應曹軍。,"When Liu Bei saw the enemy retiring from the city, he knew Cao Cao's army was close at hand. So, making arrangements for guarding the city within, he and his two brothers marched their troops out of the city and made a camp, that they might be ready to assist."
卻說夏侯惇引軍前進，正與高順軍相遇，便挺槍出馬搦戰。高順迎敵。兩馬相交，戰有四五十合，高順抵敵不住，敗下陣來。惇縱馬追趕，順遶陣而走。惇不捨，亦遶陣追之。陣上曹性看見，暗地拈弓搭箭，覷得真切，一箭射去，正中夏侯惇左目，惇大叫一聲，急用手拔箭，不想連眼珠拔出；乃大呼曰：「父精母血，不可棄也！」遂納於口內啖之，仍復挺槍縱馬，直取曹性。性不及提防，早被一槍搠透面門，死於馬下。兩邊軍士見者，無不駭然。,"Now the division of Cao Cao's army under Xiahou Dun, having marched out in advance, first came into touch with Gao Shun. Xiahou Dun at once rode out with spear set and offered a challenge. It was accepted and the two leaders fought half a hundred bouts. Then Gao Shun began to weaken and had to turn back. He rode round to the rear of his array. Xiahou Dun was not the man to quail, so he followed right into the enemy's country. Then Cao Xing, one of Lu Bu's generals, secretly strung his bow, fitted an arrow and, when Xiahou Dun had come quite near, shot at him. The arrow hit Xiahou Dun full in the left eye. He shrieked, and putting up his head, pulled out the arrow and with it the eye.""Essence of my father, blood of my mother, I cannot throw this away!"" cried Xiahou Dun, and he put the eye into his mouth and swallowed it.Then resuming his firm grip of his spear, Xiahou Dun went after this new enemy. There was no escape for Cao Xing. He was overtaken and fell with a fatal spear wound full in the face. Both sides were stricken dumb with amazement."
夏侯惇既殺曹性，縱馬便回。高順從背後趕來，麾軍齊上，曹軍大敗。夏侯淵救護其兄而走。呂虔、李典將敗軍退去濟北下寨。高順得勝，引軍回擊玄德，恰好呂布大軍亦至。布與張遼、高順分兵三路，夾攻玄德、關、張三寨。正是：啖睛猛將雖能戰，中箭先鋒難久持。未知玄德勝負如何，且看下文分解。,"Having thus slain the man who had wounded him, Xiahou Dun rode back toward his own side. Gao Shun went in pursuit and, waving on his army, attacked so vigorously that he won the day. Xiahou Yuan defended for his elder brother as they fled. Lu Qian and Li Dian led various divisions back to Jibei and made a camp.Gao Shun, having scored this victory, returned to attack Liu Bei; and as Lu Bu opportunely arrived with Zhang Liao, these three arranged their forces so that each attacked one of the brothers.Dauntless was Xiahou Dun, that warrior bold,His courage had been proved of old;But smitten sore one hapless day,He might not in the battle stay.The fate of Liu Bei will be told in the next chapter."
