卻說程昱獻計曰：「雲長有萬人之敵，非智謀不能取之。今可即差劉備手下投降之兵，入下邳，見關公，只說是逃回的，伏於城中為內應；卻引關公出戰，詐敗佯輸，誘入他處，以精兵截其歸路，然後說之可也。」操聽其謀，即令徐州降兵數十，逕投下邳來降關公。關公以為舊兵，留而不疑。,"The plan to seduce Guan Yu from allegiance to his brothers was now announced by Cheng Yu, ""Since Guan Yu is far braver than ordinary warriors, he can only be overreached by superior cunning. Now send some of the captured soldiers who have lately been of Liu Bei's army into Xiapi, where they shall say they have come back. They shall thus be our allies on the inside. Then an attack and a feigned defeat will entice Guan Yu to a distance from the city. And his return road shall be cut.""Cao Cao accepted the scheme, and a few score of the troops who had lately been in Xuzhou were sent to the city. Guan Yu believed the story they told and trusted them. So they were suffered to remain."
次日，夏侯惇為先鋒，領兵五千來搦戰。關公不出，惇即使人於城下辱罵。關公大怒，引三千人馬出城，與夏侯惇交戰。約戰十餘合，惇撥回馬走。關公趕來，惇且戰且走。關公約趕二十里，恐下邳有失，提兵便回。只聽得一聲砲響，左有徐晃，右有許褚，兩隊軍截住去路。關公奪路而走，兩邊伏兵排下硬弩百，，箭如飛蝗。關公不過，勒兵再回，徐晃，許褚，接住交戰。關公奮力殺退二人，引軍欲回下邳，夏侯惇又截住廝殺。,"After this part of the game had been played, Xiahou Dun led forward five thousand troops against the city. At first, Guan Yu would not accept the challenge. But provoked by men sent to hurl insults at him from the foot of the wall, his wrath got the better of him, and he moved out with three thousand troops. After the leaders had exchanged some ten bouts, Xiahou Dun made to run away. Guan Yu pursued. Xiahou Dun stopped and made a stand, then he fled again. Thus alternately fighting and retiring, he enticed Guan Yu seven miles from Xiapi. Then Guan Yu suddenly remembering the risk to the city drew off his army to return homeward.Soon, at the sound of a signal bomb, from the left and right out moved two bodies of troops led by Xu Huang and Xu Chu who barred his way. Guan Yu hastened along a road that seemed to offer retreat, but from both sides his ambushing enemies shot their crossbows, and the arrows flew like locusts on the wing. No way past was found, and he turned back. Then both bodies joined in attacking him. He drove them off and got into the road to his own city, but soon Xiahou Dun came up again and attacked fiercely as before."
公戰至日晚，無路可歸，只得到一座土山，引兵屯於山頭，權且少歇。曹兵團團將土山圍住。關公於山上遙望下邳城中火光沖天卻是那詐降兵卒偷開城門，曹操自提大軍殺入城中，只教舉火以惑關公之心。,"Evening came and still Guan Yu was hemmed in, so he went up on a low hill of Tushan Mountains upon which he encamped for a rest.Guan Yu was surrounded on all sides by enemies. By and by, looking toward his city, he saw the glow of fire. It meant that the traitors, who had come in to surrender, had opened the gate, and the enemy had gone in force. They had made the fires in order to perplex and distress Guan Yu."
關公見下邳火起，心中驚惶，連夜幾番衝下山來，皆被亂箭射回。捱到天曉，再欲整頓下山衝突，忽見一人跑馬上山來，視之乃張遼也。關公迎謂曰：「文遠欲來相敵耶？」遼曰：「非也。想故人舊日之情，特來相見。」遂棄刀下馬，與關公敘禮畢，坐於山頂。公曰：「文遠莫非說關某乎？」遼曰：「不然。昔日蒙兄救弟，今日弟安得不救兄？」公曰：「然則文遠將欲助我乎？」遼曰：「亦非也。」公曰：「既不助我，來此何幹？」,"Indeed the sight of the fires at Xiapi saddened Guan Yu.In the night he made efforts to escape from the hill, but every attempt was checked by flights of arrows. At daybreak he prepared for one more effort, but before moving he saw a horseman riding up at full speed and presently discerned Zhang Liao.When within speaking distance, Guan Yu said, ""Are you come to fight me, Zhang Liao?""""No,"" replied Zhang Liao. ""I am come to see you because of our old friendship.""Wherefore Zhang Liao threw aside his sword, dismounted, and came forward saluting. And the two sat down.""Then naturally you have come to talk me over,"" said Guan Yu.""Not so!"" said Zhang Liao. ""Sometime ago you saved me. Can I help saving you?""""Then you desire to help me.""""Not exactly that,"" replied Zhang Liao.""Then what are you doing here if you have not come to help me?"""
遼曰：「玄德不知存亡，翼德未知生死。昨夜曹公已破下邳，軍民盡無傷害，差人護衛玄德家眷，不許驚擾。如此相待，弟特來報兄。」關公怒曰：「此言特說我也。吾今雖處絕地，視死如歸。汝當速去，吾即下山迎戰。」張遼大笑曰：「兄此言豈不為天下笑乎？」公曰：「吾仗忠義而死，安得為天下笑？」遼曰：「兄今即死，其罪有三。」公曰：「汝且說我那三罪？」,"""Nothing is known of the fate of your elder brother, nor whether your younger brother is alive or dead. Last night your city fell into the hands of Cao Cao, but neither soldiers nor people were harmed, and a special guard was set over the family of Liu Bei lest they should be alarmed. I came to tell you how well they had been treated.""""This is certainly talking me over,"" said Guan Yu. ""Though escape is impossible, yet I am not perturbed. I look upon death as going home. You had better depart quickly and let me go down and begin the struggle again.""""Surely you must know everybody will ridicule you when they hear of this,"" said Zhang Liao.""I shall die for loyalty and righteousness. Who will laugh?"" said Guan Yu.""You would be guilty of three faults if you died.""""Tell me them,"" said Guan Yu."
遼曰：「當初劉使君與兄結義之時，誓同生死；今使君方敗，而兄即戰死，倘使君復出，欲求兄相助，而不可復得，豈不負當年之盟誓乎？其罪一也。劉使君以家眷付託於兄，兄今戰死，二夫人無所倚賴，負卻使君依託之重。其罪二也。兄武藝超群，兼通經史，不思共使君匡扶漢室，徒欲赴湯蹈火，以成匹夫之勇，安得為義？其罪三也。──兄有此三罪，弟不得不告。」,"""First of all, you and your elder brother pledged yourselves in the Peach Garden to die or to live together. Now your brother has been defeated, and you want to fight to the death. Therefore, if your brother appears again by and by and wants your help, he will seek it in vain. Is this anything else than betraying the Peach Garden Oath? Secondly, you are in charge of your brother's family and, if you fought and died, the two women would be left forlorn and without a protector. That would be a betrayal of trust. Thirdly, your military skill stands out conspicuous and will go down in history. If you do not aid your brother in his noble attempt to maintain the dynasty, then all your labors and sufferings will have been spent to win a worthless reputation as a valiant fool. Where is the sense in that? I feel it my duty to point out these three faults to you."""
公沈吟曰：「汝說我有三罪，欲我如何？」遼曰：「今四面皆曹公之兵，兄若不降，則必死；徒死無益，不若且降曹公；卻打聽劉使君音信，知何處，即往投之。一者可以保二夫人，二者不背桃園之約，三者可留有用之身。有此三便，兄宜詳之。」,"Guan Yu remained silent and thought for some time. Then he said, ""You have spoken of my three faults. What do you desire?""""You are surrounded with the certainty of death if you do not yield. There is no advantage in a useless death. Wherefore your best course is to yield to Cao Cao till you hear news of Liu Bei and can rejoin him. Thus you will ensure the safety of the two ladies and also keep inviolate the Peach Garden compact. You will preserve a useful life. Brother, you must reflect on these things."""
公曰：「兄言三便，吾有三約。若丞相能從我，即當卸甲；如其不允，吾寧受三罪而死。」遼曰：「丞相寬洪大量，何所不容？願聞三事。」公曰：「一者，吾與皇叔設誓，共扶漢室，吾今只降漢帝，不降曹操；二者，二嫂處請給皇叔俸祿贍，一應上下人等，皆不許到門；三者，但知劉皇叔去向，不管千里萬里，便當辭去。三者缺一，斷不肯降。望文遠急急回報。」,"""Brother, you have spoken of three advantages; now I have three conditions. If the Prime Minister concede these, then will I doff my armor. If he refuses, then I prefer to be guilty of the three faults and die.""""Why should the Prime Minister not concede them? He is most liberal and large minded. I pray you let me hear your conditions.""""The first is that as I and the Imperial Uncle have sworn to support the Hans, I now submit to the Emperor and not to His Prime Minister Cao Cao. The second condition is that suitable provision be made for the two ladies under my care and that no one shall be allowed to approach them. The third is that I shall be allowed to set off to rejoin Uncle Liu Bei so soon as I shall hear where he is, whether it be far or near. I require all these to be satisfied. Failing a single one, I will not submit. Wherefore, Zhang Liao, I pray you hasten back and announce them."""
張遼應諾，遂上馬，回見曹操，先說降漢不降曹之事。操笑曰；「吾為漢相，漢即吾也。此可從之。」遼又言：「二夫人欲請皇叔俸給，并上下人等不許到門。」操曰：「吾於皇叔俸內，更加倍與之。至於嚴禁內外，乃是家法，又何疑焉？」遼又曰：「但知玄德信息，雖遠必往。」操搖首曰：「然則吾養雲長何用？此事卻難從。」遼曰：「豈不聞豫讓眾人國士之論乎？劉玄德待雲長不過恩厚耳。丞相更施厚恩以結其心，何憂雲長之不服也？」操曰：「文遠之言甚當，吾願從此三事。」,"Zhang Liao lost no time but rode back to Cao Cao. When he spoke of Guan Yu's intention to submit to the Hans but not to Cao Cao, the latter laughed, saying, ""As I am a minister of Han, so am I Han. I grant that.""Zhang Liao then spoke of provision due to their rank and security from molestation for the ladies, to which Cao Cao replied, ""I will give them twice the regular amount for an Uncle of the Emperor. As for securing them from molestation, that is simple. The ordinary domestic law is enough. Why should there be any doubt?""Then said Zhang Liao, ""Whenever he shall get news of the whereabouts of Liu Bei, he must go to him.""At this Cao Cao shook his head, saying, ""Then I am merely to feed Guan Yu. What is the use of this? I cannot consent.""Zhang Liao replied, ""You must know of Yu Rang's saying: The difference in behavior brought about by difference of treatment? Liu Bei treats Guan Yu just kindly and liberally. You can surely engage Guan Yu's heart and support by being kinder and more liberal.""""What you say is much to the point. I will grant the three conditions,"" said Cao Cao."
張遼再往上回報關公。關公曰：「雖然如此，暫請丞相退軍，容我入城見二嫂，告知其事，然後投降。」張遼再回，以此言報曹操。操即傳令，退軍至十里。荀彧曰：「不可。恐有詐。」操曰：「雲長義士，必不失信。」遂引軍退。關公引兵入下邳，見人民安妥不動，竟到府中，來見二嫂。,"Whereupon Zhang Liao left to carry the news to Guan Yu, still on the summit of the Tushan Mountains.Said Guan Yu, ""Now I expect the army to withdraw so that I may enter the city to tell the two ladies what has been arranged. After that I submit at once.""Zhang Liao rode back once more with this request, and the order was given for the army to retire three miles.""Do not do this,"" said Xun Yu. ""I fear treachery.""""He will certainly not break faith,"" said Cao Cao. ""He is too high principled.""The army retired, and Guan Yu with his force reentered the city of Xiapi, where he saw that the people were following their ordinary avocations in tranquillity. He came to the palace and went in to see the two ladies."
甘、糜二夫人聽得關公到來，急出迎之。公拜於階下曰：「使二嫂受驚，某之罪也。」二夫人曰：「皇叔今在何處？」公曰：「不知去向。」二夫人曰：「二叔今將若何？」公曰：「關某出城死戰，被困土山，張遼勸我投降，我以三事相約。曹操已皆允從，故特退兵，放我入城。我不曾得嫂嫂主意，未敢擅便。」二夫人問那三事。關公將上項三事，備述一遍。甘夫人曰：「昨日曹軍入城，我等皆以為必死；誰想毫髮不動，，一軍不敢入門。叔叔既已領諾，何必問我二人？只恐日後曹操不肯容叔叔去尋皇叔。」公曰：「嫂嫂放心，關某自有主張。」二夫人曰：「叔叔自家裁處，凡事不必問俺女流。」,"The two ladies hastened to meet him Guan Yu.He bowed to them below the steps and said, ""I apologize for having caused you to feel alarmed.""""Where is the Uncle?"" asked they.""I know not whither he has gone.""""What do you intend to do, brother-in-law?""""I went out of the city to try a last battle. I was surrounded on a hill top, and Zhang Liao has urged me to yield. I proposed three conditions, all of which were conceded, and the enemy drew off to allow me to return to the city. Unless I have your decision, sisters-in-law, I scarcely dare to take any final step.""They asked what were the conditions and were told.Lady Gan said, ""When Cao Cao's army came in, we took it to mean certain death. But it is scarcely credible that not a hair of our heads has been disturbed. Not a soldier has dared enter our doors. You have accepted the conditions, brother-in-law, and there is no need to ask our consent. Our only fear is that he will not let you go by and by to search for the Uncle.""""Sisters-in-law, you need not be anxious. I will see to that.""""You must decide everything and need not ask us."""
關公辭退，遂引數十騎來見曹操。操自出轅門相接。關公下馬入拜，操慌忙答禮。關公曰：「敗兵之將，深荷不殺之恩。」操曰：「素慕雲長忠義，今日幸得相見，足慰平生之望。」關公曰：「文遠代稟三事，蒙丞相應允，諒不食言。」操曰：「吾言既出，安敢失信？」關公曰：「關某若知皇叔所在，雖蹈水火，必往從之。此時恐不及拜辭，伏乞見原。」操曰：「玄德若在，必從公去；但恐亂軍中亡矣。公且寬心，尚容緝聽。」,"Guan Yu withdrew and then, with a small escort, went to his interview with Cao Cao. Cao Cao came to the outermost gate to welcome him, and Guan Yu dismounted and made obeisance. Cao Cao returned his salute with the greatest cordiality.""The leader of a defeated army is grateful for the graciousness that has preserved his life,"" said Guan Yu.""I have so long admired your loyalty and high principles that this happy meeting gratifies the desire of my whole life,"" replied Cao Cao.""As the Prime Minister has granted the three requests which my friend petitioned for on my behalf, there is now but little to discuss,"" said Guan Yu.""As I have spoken, so be it. I could not break faith,"" replied Cao Cao.""Whenever I hear where Uncle Liu Bei is, I must certainly go to him, even if through fire and water. It may be that there will be no time nor opportunity of saying farewell. I trust you will understand the reason.""""If Liu Bei should prove to be alive, you must certainly be allowed to go to him. But I fear that in the confusion he may have lost his life. You may set your mind at rest and let me make inquiries."""
關公拜謝。操設宴相待。次日班師還許昌。關公收拾車仗，請二嫂上車，親自護車而行。於路安歇驛館，操欲亂其君臣之禮，使關公與二嫂共處一室。關公乃秉燭立於戶外，自夜達旦，毫無倦色。操見公如此，愈加敬服。既到許昌，操撥一府與關公居住。關公分一宅為兩院，內門撥老軍十人把守。關公自居外宅。操引關公朝見獻帝，帝命為偏將軍。公謝恩歸宅。,"Guan Yu thanked him. Then a banquet was prepared in Guan Yu's honor. Next day the army started on its homeward march.For the journey to the capital, a carriage was prepared for the two ladies, and Guan Yu was its guard. On the road they rested at a certain post station, and Cao Cao, anxious to compromise Guan Yu by beguiling him into forgetfulness of his duty, assigned Guan Yu to the same apartment as his sisters-in-law. Guan Yu stood the whole night before the door with a lighted candle in his hand. Not once did he yield to fatigue. Cao Cao's respect for him could not but increase.At the capital the Prime Minister assigned a dignified residence to Guan Yu, which he immediately divided into two enclosures, the inner one for the two ladies and the other for himself. He placed a guard of eighteen of his veterans over the women's quarters.Guan Yu was presented to Emperor Xian who conferred upon him the rank of General Who Serves the Hans. Guan Yu expressed his thanks to the Emperor."
操次日設大宴，會眾謀臣武士，以客禮待關公，延之上座；又備綾錦及金銀器皿相送。關公都送與二嫂收貯。關公自到許昌，操待之甚厚；小宴三日，大宴五日；又送美女十人，使侍關公。關公盡送入內門，令伏侍二嫂。卻又三日一次於內門外躬身施禮，動問二嫂安否。二夫人回問皇叔之事畢，曰：「叔叔自便。」關公方敢退回。操聞之，又歎關公不已。,"Next day Cao Cao made a great banquet, inviting all his advisers and officers, solely in honor of Guan Yu, who sat in the seat of honor. Beside this Guan Yu received presents of silks and gold and silver vessels, all of which Guan Yu sent into the ladies' quarters for their use and keeping. In fact from the day of arrival in the capital, Guan Yu was treated with marked respect and distinction, small banquets following each other in each three days, and large banquets held in each five days.Cao Cao also presented him with ten most lovely serving girls. Guan Yu sent these also within to wait upon his two sisters-in-law.Every third day Guan Yu went to the door of the women's quarters to inquire after their welfare, and then they asked if any news of the wanderer had come. This ceremony closed with the words: ""Brother-in-law, you may retire when you wish.""Cao Cao heard of this extremely correct behavior and thought all the more of the man for it."
一日，操見關公所穿綠錦戰袍已舊，即度其身品，取異錦作戰袍一領相贈。關公受之，穿於衣底，上仍用舊袍罩之。操笑曰：「雲長何如此之儉乎？」公曰：「某非儉也。舊袍乃劉皇叔所賜，某穿之如見兄面，不敢以丞相之新賜而忘兄長之舊賜，故穿於上。」操歎曰：「真義士也！」然口雖稱羨，心實不悅。,"One day Cao Cao noticed that the robe Guan Yu was wearing was old and frayed. Taking his measurements, Cao Cao had a new one made of fine brocade and presented it to him. Guan Yu took it and put it on under the old robe, so that the latter covered it.""Why so very thrifty?"" laughed Cao Cao.""It is not thrift,"" was his reply. ""The old robe was a gift from my brother, and I wear it because it reminds me of him. I could not allow the new gift to eclipse his old one.""""How very high principled!"" said Cao Cao, sighing."
一日，關公在府，忽報：「內院二夫人哭倒於地，不知為何，請將軍速入。」關公乃整衣跪於內門外，問二嫂為何悲泣。甘夫人曰：「我夜夢皇叔身陷於土坑之內，覺來與糜夫人論之，想在九泉之下矣，是以相哭。」關公曰；「夢寐之事，不可憑信。此嫂嫂想念之故。請勿憂愁。」,"One day when Guan Yu was at home, there came a messenger to say that the two women had thrown themselves on the ground and were weeping. They would not say why.Guan Yu set his dress in order, went over, and knelt by the door, saying, ""Why this grief, sisters-in-law?""Lady Gan replied, ""In the night I dreamed that the Uncle had fallen into a pit. I woke up and told Lady Mi, and we think he must be dead. So we weep.""""Dreams are not to be credited,"" he replied. ""You dreamed of him because you were thinking of him. Pray do not grieve."""
正說間，適曹操命使來請關公赴宴。公辭二嫂，往見操。操見公有淚容，問其故。公曰：「二嫂思兄痛哭，不由某心不悲。」操笑而寬解之，頻以酒相勸。公醉，自綽其髯而言曰：「生不能報國家，而背其兄，徒為人也！」操問曰：「雲長髯有數乎？」公曰：「約數百根。每秋月約退三五根。冬月多以皂紗囊裹之，恐其斷也。」操以紗錦作囊，與關公護髯。次日，早朝見帝。帝見關公一紗錦囊垂於胸次，帝問之。關公奏曰：「臣髯頗長，丞相賜囊貯之。」帝令當殿披拂，過於其腹。帝曰：「真美髯公也！」因此人皆呼為美髯公。,"Just then Guan Yu was invited to another banquet, so he took leave of the ladies and went. Seeing Guan Yu looked sad and tearful, his host asked the reason.""My sisters-in-law have been weeping for my brother, and I cannot help being sad in sympathy.""Cao Cao smiled and tried to cheer up his guest. Cao Cao plied Guan Yu with wine so that Guan Yu became quite intoxicated and sat stroking his beard and saying, ""What a useless thing am I! I could do no service for my country, and I have parted from my elder brother.""""How many hairs in your beard?"" suddenly asked his host.""Some hundreds, perhaps. In the autumn a few fall out, but in the winter it is fullest. Then I use a black silk bag to keep the hairs from being broken,"" replied Guan Yu.Cao Cao had a bag made for him to protect his beard. Soon after when they were at court, the Emperor asked what was the bag he saw on Guan Yu's breast.""My beard is rather long, Your Majesty,"" said Guan Yu. ""So the Prime Minister gave me a bag to protect it.""The Emperor bade him take off the bag and show his beard in all its fullness and it fell in rippling waves below his breast.""Really a most beautiful beard!"" said the Emperor.This is why people call him: ""The Man with the Beautiful Beard."""
忽一日，操請關公宴。臨散，送公出府，見公馬瘦，操曰：「公馬因何瘦？」關公曰：「賤軀頗重，馬不能載，因此常瘦。」操令左右備一馬來。須臾牽至。那馬身如火炭，狀甚雄偉。操指曰：「公識此馬否？」公曰：「莫非呂布所騎赤馬乎？」操曰：「然也。」遂并鞍轡送與關公。關公再拜稱謝。操不悅曰：「吾累送美女金帛，公未嘗下拜；今吾贈馬，乃喜而再拜，何賤人貴畜耶？」關公曰：「吾知此馬日行千里，今幸得之，若知兄長下落，可一日而見面矣。」操愕然悔。關公辭去。後人有詩歎曰：,"Another time, after a banquet, Cao Cao was seeing his guest start from the gate of his palace when he noticed that his charger was very thin.""Why is it so thin?"" said Cao Cao.""My worthless body is rather heavy and really too much for it. It is always out of condition.""Cao Cao at once told his attendants to bring out a certain steed, and before long it appeared. It was red, like glowing charcoal, and a handsome creature in every way.""Do you recognize it?"" asked Cao Cao.""Why, it is no other than Red Hare!"" cried Guan Yu.""Yes, it is Red Hare,"" said Cao Cao.And he presented the horse, all fully caparisoned, to his guest.Guan Yu bowed many times and thanked him again and again, till Cao Cao began to feel displeased and said, ""I have given you many things, lovely handmaids and gold and silks and never won a bow of gratitude from you before. This horse seems to please you better than all the rest. Why do you think so poorly of the damsels and so much of the steed?""""I know the horse: It can travel three hundred miles a day, and I am very lucky to get him. Now as soon as I find out where my brother is, I can get to him in a single day,"" said Guan Yu.Cao Cao grumbled to himself and began to repent of his gift."
威傾三國著英豪，一宅分居義氣高。奸相枉將虛禮待，豈知關羽不降曹。,"Fortune dealt a stunning blow, still he played his part;Partitioning his dwelling proved his purity of heart.The crafty minister desired to win him to his side,But felt that failure was foredoomed however much he tried."
操問張遼曰：「吾待雲長不薄，而彼常懷去心，何也？」遼曰：「容某探其情。」次日，往見關公。禮畢，遼曰：「我薦兄在丞相處，不曾落後？」公曰：「深感丞相厚意；只是吾身雖在此，心念皇叔，未嘗去懷。」遼曰：「兄言差矣。處世不分輕重，非丈夫也。玄德待兄，未必過於丞相，兄何故只懷去志？」公曰：「吾固知曹公待吾甚厚；奈吾受劉皇叔厚恩，誓以共死，不可背之。吾終不留此。要必立以報曹公，然後去耳。」遼曰：「倘玄德已棄世，公何所歸乎？」公曰：「願從於地下。」,"Said Cao Cao to Zhang Liao, ""I have treated Guan Yu pretty liberally, but he still cherishes the desire to leave me. Do you know if it is really so?""""I will try to find out,"" was the reply.So Zhang Liao took an early opportunity of seeing Guan Yu, and when the politeness of the visit were over, Zhang Liao said, ""I recommended you to the Prime Minister, and you have not lost much by that.""""I am deeply affected by his kindness and bounty,"" said Guan Yu, ""but, though my body is here, yet I am always thinking of my brother.""""Your words do not express present conditions quite correctly. One who lives in the world without discrimination and consideration of his relations with others is not the most admirable type of person. Even Liu Bei never treated you better than does the Prime Minister. Why then do you maintain this desire to get away?""""I know only too well that he has been most kind, but I have also received great kindness from Uncle Liu Bei. Beside we have sworn to die together, and I cannot remain here. But before I go, I must try to render the Prime Minister some signal service to prove my gratitude.""""Supposing Liu Bei should have left the world, whither will you go?"" said Zhang Liao.""I will follow him to the below realms of Nine Golden Springs."""
遼知公終不可留，乃告退，回見曹操，具以實告。操歎曰：「事主不忘其本，乃天下之義士也！」荀彧曰：「彼言立功方去，若不教彼立功，未必便去。」操然之。,"There could no longer be the least doubt as to Guan Yu's intentions, and Zhang Liao told Cao Cao just how matters stood. Cao Cao sighed.""To serve one's chief with unswerving fidelity is a proof of the highest principle of all,"" said he.Said Xun Yu, ""He spoke of performing some act of service before leaving. If he gets no chance of such a thing, he will not be able to go.""Cao Cao agreed that this was so."
卻說玄德在袁紹處，旦夕煩惱。紹曰：「玄德何故常憂？」玄德曰：「二弟不知音耗，妻小陷於曹賊；上不能報國，下不能保家，安得不憂？」紹曰：「吾欲進兵赴許都久矣。方今春煖，正好興兵。」便商議破曹之策。田豐諫曰：「前操攻徐州，許都空虛，不及此時進兵；今徐州已破，操兵方銳，未可輕敵。不如以久持之，待其有隙而後可動也。」,"Liu Bei went to Yuan Shao for refuge. Here Liu Bei was always sorrowful and, when asked the reason, said he did not know where his brothers were nor what had happened to his family since they fell into the hands of Cao Cao.""Why should I not be sad when I have failed towards my country and my family?"" said he.""I have long wished to attack Xuchang,"" said Yuan Shao. ""Now it is autumn and just the time for an expedition, so let us discuss plans for the destruction of Cao Cao.""Tian Feng at once opposed this.""When Cao Cao attacked Xuzhou and Xuchang was undefended, you let the chance slip by. Now that Xuzhou has been captured, and their soldiers are flushed with victory, it would be madness to attempt it. It is necessary to await another chance."""
紹曰：「待我思之。」因問玄德曰：「田豐勸我固守，何如？」玄德曰：「曹操欺君之賊，明公若不討之，恐失大義於天下。」紹曰：「玄德之言甚善。」遂欲興兵。田豐又諫。紹怒曰：「汝等弄文輕武，使我失大義！」田豐頓首曰：「若不聽臣良言，出師不利。」紹大怒，欲斬之。玄德力勸，乃囚於獄中。沮授見田豐下獄，乃會其宗族，盡散家財，與之訣曰：「吾隨軍而去，勝則威無不加，敗則一身不保矣！」眾皆下淚送之。,"""Let me think about it,"" said Yuan Shao.He asked advice from Liu Bei whether to attack or to hold on.Liu Bei replied, ""Cao Cao is a rebel. I think you are failing in your duty if you do not attack him.""""Your words are good,"" said Yuan Shao.He made up his mind to move. But again the adviser Tian Feng intervened.Then Yuan Shao grew angry, saying, ""You fellows who cultivate literature and despise war have made me miss a lot!""Tian Feng bowed his head and said, ""Neglect your servant's wise words, and you will fail in the field.""Yuan Shao was so angry that he wanted to put Tian Feng to death. However, Liu Bei begged him off and he was only imprisoned.Seeing the fate of his colleague, another adviser, Ju Shou, assembled his clan and distributed among them all his possessions, saying, ""I go with the army. If we succeed, then nothing can exceed our glory; but if we are defeated, the risk I run is great.""His friends wept as they said farewell."
紹遣大將顏良作先鋒，進攻白馬。沮授諫曰：「顏良性狹，雖驍勇，不可獨任。」紹曰：「吾之上將，非汝等可料。」大軍進發至黎陽，東邵太守劉延告急許昌。曹操急議興兵抵敵。關公聞知，遂入相府見操曰：「聞丞相起兵，某願為前部。」操曰：「未敢煩將軍。早晚有事，當來相請。」關公乃退。操引兵十五萬，分三面隊行。於路又連接劉延告急文書，操先提五萬軍親臨白馬，靠土山劄住。遙望山前平川曠野之地，顏良前部精兵十萬，排成陣勢。操駭然，回顧呂布舊將宋憲曰：「吾聞汝乃呂布部下猛將，今可與顏良一戰。」,"General Yan Liang was appointed to the command of the advance guard, to go to attack Baima.Then Ju Shou first protested, ""His mind is too narrow for such a post. He is brave but unequal to such a trust.""""You are not the sort of man to measure my best generals,"" replied Yuan Shao.The army marched to Liyang, and Governor Liu Yue of Dongjun sent an urgent call to Xuchang for aid. Cao Cao moved his armies hastily.As soon as the news of battle got about, Guan Yu went to see the Prime Minister and said, ""Illustrious Sir, the army is mobilized. I volunteer for the van leader.""""I scarcely dare put you to such inconvenience, but presently, if need arises, I will call upon you.""So Guan Yu retired, and one hundred fifty thousand soldiers marched out in three directions. On the road the letters from Liu Yue arrived praying for help, and Cao Cao marched the first fifty thousand troops to Baima and took up a position supported by the hills. In the wide plains in front of them, Yan Liang was encamped with one hundred thousand veterans.Cao Cao was frightened at the force opposed to him and, returning to camp, spoke to Song Xian, who had once served under Lu Bu, saying, ""You are one of Lu Bu's famous veteran generals. Can you give battle to this Yan Liang?"""
宋憲領諾，綽鎗上馬，直出陣前。顏良橫刀立馬於門旗下；見宋憲馬至，良大喝一聲，縱馬來迎。戰不三合，手起刀落，斬宋憲於陣前。曹操大驚曰：「真勇將也！」魏續曰：「殺我同伴，願去報讎！」操許之。續上馬持矛，逕出陣前，大罵顏良。良更不打話，交馬一合，照頭一刀，劈魏續於馬下。操曰：「今誰敢當之？」徐晃應聲而出，與顏良戰二十合，敗歸本陣。諸將慄然。曹操收軍，良亦引軍退去。,"Song Xian agreed to try. He armed himself, mounted, and rode to the front. Yan Liang was there on horseback, his sword lying crossways. Seeing an opponent approaching, he uttered a loud shout and galloped toward Song Xian. The two met, but after only three bouts, Song Xian fell under a mighty slash from Yan Liang's sword.""What a terrible leader!"" said Cao Cao.""He has slain my comrade, I want to go and avenge him,"" then cried Wei Xu.Cao Cao bade him go and he rode out, spear set, and in front of the army railed at Yan Liang.Yan Liang replied not a word, but their two steeds came together; and at the first blow from Yan Liang's sword, Wei Xu's forehead was halved.""Now, who again dares face him?"" cried Cao Cao.Xu Huang took up the challenge and he went out. The combat endured twenty bouts, and then Xu Huang fled back to his own side. The other generals were now greatly depressed at their failure. Cao Cao withdrew his army, and Yan Liang also marched off his force."
操見連折二將，心中憂悶。程昱曰：「某舉一人可敵顏良。」操問是誰。昱曰：「非關公不可。」操曰：「吾恐他立了功便去。」昱曰：「劉備若在必投袁紹；今若使雲長破袁紹之兵，紹必疑劉備而殺之矣。備既死，雲長又安往乎？」操大喜，遂差人去請關公。關公即入辭二嫂。二嫂曰：「叔叔此去，可打聽皇叔消息。」,"Cao Cao felt very sad at the loss of two generals in quick succession. Then Cheng Yu went to see his chief, saying, ""I can produce a man the equal of Yan Liang.""""Who?"" cried Cao Cao.""No other than Guan Yu.""""I am afraid that if he is given an opportunity to perform that return service he spoke of, he will leave me.""""If Liu Bei is still alive, he is with Yuan Shao. If you get Guan Yu to defeat Yuan Shao's army, Yuan Shao will look askance at Liu Bei and put him to death. Liu Bei gone, where can Guan Yu go?""This argument appealed to Cao Cao at once, and he sent to request Guan Yu to come.Previous to obeying the call, Guan Yu went to say farewell to his sisters-in-law.""You may get news of the Uncle on the journey,"" said they."
關公領諾而出，提青龍刀，上赤兔馬，引從者數人，直至白馬來見曹操。操敘說顏良連誅二將，勇不可當，特請雲長商議。關公曰：「容某觀之。」操置酒相待。忽報顏良搦戰，操引關公上土山觀看。操與關公坐，諸將環立。曹操指山下顏良排的陣勢，旗幟鮮明，鎗刀森布，嚴整有威，乃謂關公曰：「河北人馬，如此雄壯！」關公曰：「以吾觀之，如土雞瓦犬耳！」操又指曰：「麾蓋之下，銹袍金甲，持刀立馬者，乃顏良也。」關舉目一望，謂操曰：「吾觀顏良，如插標賣首耳！」操曰：「未可輕視。」關公起身曰：「某雖不才，願去萬軍中取其首級，來獻丞相。」張遼曰：「軍中無戲言，雲長不可忽也。」,"""Yes,"" said Guan Yu and left them.Armed with his green-dragon saber, riding on the swift steed Red Hare, and having but a slender following, Guan Yu was not long in arriving at Baima. He saw Cao Cao, who told him what had happened. Yan Liang was too valiant for any to face.""Let me look at him,"" said Guan Yu.Then wine was served for his refreshment, and while they were drinking, it was reported that Yan Liang once again offered a challenge. So Cao Cao and his guest and staff went to the summit of a hill whence the enemy could be seen. Cao Cao and Guan Yu sat on the hill top, and the commanders stood about them. Cao Cao pointed out Yan Liang's troops arrayed on the plains below. The ensigns and banners waving fresh and bright amid the forest of spears and swords made a grand and imposing spectacle.""See how formidable these soldiers of the North of Yellow River are,"" said Cao Cao.""I regard them as so many clay fowls and mud dogs,"" said Guan Yu.Cao Cao pointed out Yan Liang, saying, ""There under that grand umbrella, in that embroidered robe and that silver breastplate and riding on horseback and gripping that huge sword is Yan Liang.""""His head looks as though it was stuck on a pole for sale,"" said Guan Yu, just glancing over the army at his feet.""He is very terrible. You must not despise him,"" said Cao Cao.Guan Yu rose, saying, ""I am a poor thing, but I will go over and bring you his head if you like.""""Joking is not allowed in this army,"" interposed Zhang Liao. ""Please be careful what you say, General."""
關公奮然上馬，倒提青龍刀，跑下山來，鳳目圓睜，蠶眉直豎，直衝彼陣，河北軍如波開浪裂。關公逕奔顏良。顏良正在麾蓋下，見關公衝來，方欲問時，關公赤兔馬快，早已跑到面前；顏良措手不及，被雲長手起一刀，刺於馬下。忽地下馬，割了顏良首級，拴於馬項之下，飛身上馬，提刀出陣，如入無人之境。河北兵將大驚，不戰自亂。曹軍乘勢攻擊，死者不可勝數；馬匹器械，搶奪極多。關公縱馬上山，眾將盡皆稱賀。公獻首級於操前。操曰：「將軍真神人也！」關公曰：「某何足道哉！吾弟張翼德於百萬軍中取上將之首，如探囊取物耳。」操大驚，回顧左右曰：「今後如遇張翼德，不可輕敵。」令寫於衣袍襟底以記之。,"Guan Yu quickly mounted, turned down his mighty weapon, and galloped down the hill, his phoenix eyes rounded, and his silkworm eyebrows fiercely bristling. He dashed straight into the enemy's array, and the northern soldiers opened like falling waves and dissolving storms. He made directly for the commander.Now Yan Liang sitting there in state saw a horseman rushing toward him, and just as he began to ask who the rider of the red horse was, lo! the horseman was there. Taken utterly by surprise, the leader could make no defense. Guan Yu's arm rose and the mighty weapon fell. And with it fell Yan Liang.Leaping from the saddle, Guan Yu cut off his victim's head and hung it to his horse's neck. Then he mounted and rode out, just as if there was no army there.The northern troops, panic stricken, made no fight. Cao Cao's army attacked with full force and slew great numbers of them. They captured many horses and weapons and much military gear. Guan Yu rode quickly back up the hill and laid the proof of his prowess at the feet of the Prime Minister.""You are more than human, General!"" cried Cao Cao.""What have I done to talk about?"" said Guan Yu. ""My brother, Zhang Fei, did the same thing in an army of a hundred legions, and did it as easily as picking something from his own pocket.""Cao Cao marveled at the statement and turning to those about him said, ""If you meet this Zhang Fei, be careful.""And he bade them make a note on the overlap of their robes so that they should remember."
卻說顏良敗軍奔回，半路迎見袁紹，報說被赤面長鬚使大刀一勇將，匹馬入陣，斬顏良而去，因此大敗。紹驚問曰：「此人是誰？」沮授曰：「此必是劉玄德之弟關雲長也。」紹大怒，指玄德曰：「汝弟斬吾愛將，汝必通謀，留你何用！」喚刀斧手推出玄德斬之。正是：初見方為座上客，此日幾同階下囚。未知玄德性命如何，且看下文分解。,"The beaten army returning northward met Yuan Shao on the road and told their story.""A red-faced warrior with a long beard, wielding a huge, long-handled sword, broke into the army, cut off the General's head and bore it off,"" said they.""Who was this?"" asked Yuan Shao.Ju Shou said, ""It must have been Liu Bei's brother, Guan Yu. It could be nobody else.""Yuan Shao was very angry and, pointing to Liu Bei, he said, ""Your brother has slain my beloved leader. You are in the plot too. Why should I save you alive?""He bade the lictors take Liu Bei away and behead him.Morning saw him guest on high.Evening, prisoner, doomed to die.Liu Bei's actual fate will be told in the next chapter."
