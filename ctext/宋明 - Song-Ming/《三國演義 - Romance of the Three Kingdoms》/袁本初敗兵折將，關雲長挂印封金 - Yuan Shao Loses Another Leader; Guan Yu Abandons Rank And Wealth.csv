卻說袁紹欲斬玄德。玄德從容進曰：「明公只聽一面之詞，而絕向日之情耶？備自徐州失散，二弟雲長未知存否；天下同貌者不少，豈赤面長鬚之人，即為關某也？明公何不察之？」袁紹是個沒主張的人，聞玄德之言，責沮授曰：「誤聽汝言，險殺好人。」遂仍請玄德上帳坐，議報顏良之讎。帳下一人應聲而進曰：「顏良與我如兄弟，今被曹賊所殺，我安得不洩此恨？」,"As the last chapter closed, Liu Bei had been condemned to die.Liu Bei spoke up, however, and said, ""Pray hear one word, Illustrious Sir, before you decide. I have lost sight of my brother since my misfortune at Xuzhou and know not whether Guan Yu be dead or alive. There are many men in the world who resemble him. Is every red-faced man with a beard named Guan Yu? Should you not rather seek some evidence?""Now Yuan Shao was impulsive and facile by nature, and when Liu Bei spoke thus, he suddenly turned upon Ju Shou, saying, ""By wrongly regarding what you said, I nearly killed an innocent person.""Then Yuan Shao requested Liu Bei once more to resume his seat in the tent and give advice on how to avenge Yan Liang.Soon from the lower end a voice was heard, saying, ""Yan Liang and I were as brothers, and can I allow any other to avenge his death?"""
玄德視其人，身長八尺，面如獬豸，乃河北名將文醜也。袁紹大喜曰：「非汝不能報顏良之讎。吾與十萬軍兵，便渡黃河，追殺曹賊！」沮授曰：「不可。今宜留屯延津，分兵官渡，乃為上策。若輕舉渡河，設或有變，眾皆不能還矣。」紹怒曰：「皆是汝等遲緩軍心，遷延日月，有妨大事！豈不聞『兵貴神速』乎？」沮授出，歎曰：「上盈其志，下務其功；悠悠黃河，吾其濟乎！」遂託疾不出議事。,"The speaker was a man of eight-span height with a face like a jilin, a famous leader from the North of Yellow River, named Wen Chou.Yuan Shao was pleased and said, ""You are the only man who can do it. I will give you one hundred thousand troops, and you can cross the Yellow River, and quickly smite that rebel Cao Cao.""You cannot do it. Wen Chou will fail,"" said Ju Shou. ""The proper course is to hold Yanjin and detach a force to Guandu. If you rashly cross the river and anything goes wrong, not a soul will return.""Yuan Shao said, ""That is always the way with you fellows, always delaying and taking the dash out of the army. You put off today and postpone tomorrow till success has become impossible. Do you forget that promptitude is what each soldier honors?""The adviser withdrew sadly, saying, ""Superiors do not curb their ambitions; inferiors crave for achievements; things are undone. Eternal is the course of Yellow River, shall I change it?""Thereafter Ju Shou feigned illness and went no more to the council."
玄德曰：「備蒙大恩，無可報效，意欲與文將軍同行：一者報明公之德，二者就探雲長的實信。」紹喜，喚文醜與玄德同領前部。文醜曰：「劉玄德屢敗之將，於軍不利。既主公要他去時，某分三萬軍，教他為後部。」於是文醜自領七萬軍先行，令玄德引三萬軍隨後。,"Liu Bei said, ""I have received much kindness at your hands and have been unable to show my gratitude. I would accompany General Wen Chou that I may repay your bounty and also that I may hear news of my brother.""Yuan Shao gladly consented and ordered Wen Chou to share his command with Liu Bei.But the former objected, saying, ""Liu Bei has been so often defeated that it will augur ill for success this time. Since you wish, I will give Liu Bei command of the rear guard of thirty thousand soldiers.""And this being approved, three legions were told off under Liu Bei's special command to follow the main body."
且說曹操見雲長斬了顏良，倍加欽敬，表奏朝廷，封雲長為漢壽亭侯，，鑄印貽關公。忽報袁紹又使大將文醜渡黃河，已據延津之上。操乃先使人移徙居民於西河，然後自領兵迎之；傳下將令，以後軍為前軍，以前軍為後軍；糧草先行，軍兵在後。呂虔曰：「糧草在先，軍兵在後，何意也？」操曰：「糧草在後，多被摽掠，故令在前。」虔曰：「倘遇敵軍劫去，如之奈何？」操曰：「且待敵軍到時，卻有理會。」,"The prowess displayed by Guan Yu in the bold attack on Yan Liang redoubled Cao Cao's respect for him, and Cao Cao memorialized the Throne that Guan Yu receive the title of Lord of Hanshou, and a seal was cast for him.Just then came the unexpected news that Yuan Shao's army had moved toward the Yellow River and was in position above Yanjin. Cao Cao first sent to transfer the inhabitants to the west bank and then led out an army to oppose Yuan Shao. He issued an order to face about, thus placing the rear companies in front. The commissariat wagons were also placed in the van.""What is this reversal for?"" asked Lu Qian.Cao Cao replied, ""When the supplies are in rear, they are liable to be plundered. So I have put them first.""""But if you meet the enemy and they steal them?""""Wait till the enemy appears. I shall know what to do."""
虔心疑未決。操令糧食輜重沿河塹至延津。操在後軍，聽得前軍發喊，急教人看時，報說：「河北大將文醜兵至，我軍皆棄糧草，四散奔走。後軍又遠，將如之何？」操以鞭指兩阜曰：「此可暫避。」人馬急奔土阜。操令軍士皆解衣卸甲少歇，盡放其馬。文醜軍掩至。眾將曰：「賊至矣！可急收馬匹，退回白馬！」荀攸急止之曰：「此正可以餌敵，何故反退？」操急以目視荀攸而笑。攸知其意，不復言。,"Lu Qian was much exercised at this new move of the Prime Minister. In the meantime the supply train moved along the river toward Yanjin. Presently the foremost troops raised a great shout, and Cao Cao sent to see what it meant.The messenger came back, saying, ""Wen Chou's army is approaching, and the supply train has been abandoned and is at the mercy of the enemy. The main body is still far behind. What to do next?""Thereupon Cao Cao pointed to two mounds, saying, ""We will take refuge here for the present.""All those near him hastened to the mounds. There Cao Cao ordered them all to loosen their dress, lay aside their breastplates, and rest a time. The horsemen turned their steeds loose.Wen Chou's soldiers approached under cover. As they drew near, the officers told Cao Cao, saying, ""The rebels are near. We ought to catch the horses and go back to Baima.""But Adviser Xun You checked them, saying, ""These are a bait for the enemy. Why retire?""Cao Cao glanced across at him and said, ""He understands. Do not say anything."""
文醜軍既得糧草車仗，又來搶馬。軍士不依隊伍，自相雜亂。曹操卻令軍將一齊下土阜擊之，文醜軍大亂。曹兵圍裏將來，文醜挺身獨戰，軍士自相踐踏。文醜止遏不住，只得撥馬回走。操在土阜上指曰：「文醜為河北名將，誰可擒之？」張遼、徐晃，飛馬齊出，大叫：「文醜休走！」文醜回頭見二將趕上，遂按住鐵槍，拈弓搭箭，正射張遼。徐晃大叫：「賊將休放箭！」張遼低頭急躲，一箭射中頭盔，將簪纓射去。遼奮力再趕，坐下戰馬，又被文醜一箭射中面頰。那馬跪倒前蹄，張遼落地。,"Now having got possession of the supply carts, the enemy next came to seize the horses. By this time they had all broken ranks and were scattered, each soldier going his own way. Then suddenly Cao Cao gave the order to go down from the mounds and smite them.The surprise was complete. Wen Chou's army was in confusion, and Cao Cao's army surrounded them. Wen Chou made a stand, but those about him trampled each other down, and he could do nothing but flee. And he fled.Then standing on the top of a mound Cao Cao pointed to the flying leader, calling out, ""There is one of the most famous generals of the north. Who can capture him?""Zhang Liao and Xu Huang both mounted and dashed after him, crying, ""Wen Chou, do not run away!""Looking round, the fugitive saw two pursuers, and then he set aside his spear, took his bow and adjusted an arrow, which he shot at Zhang Liao.""Cease shooting, you rebel!"" shouted Xu Huang.Zhang Liao ducked his head, and the shaft went harmlessly by, save that it carried away the tassel of his cap. He only pressed harder in pursuit. The next arrow however struck his horse in the head, and the animal stumbled and fell, throwing its rider to the earth."
文醜回馬復來，徐晃急輪大斧，截住廝殺。只見文醜後面軍馬齊到，晃料敵不過，撥馬而回。文醜沿河趕來。忽見十餘騎馬，旗號翩翻，一將當頭提刀飛馬而來，乃關雲長也，大喝：「賊將休走！」與文醜交馬，戰不三合，文醜心怯，撥馬遶河而走。那關公馬快，趕上文醜，腦後一刀，將文醜斬下馬來。曹操在土阜上，見關公砍了文醜，大驅人馬掩殺。河北軍大半落水，糧草馬匹仍被曹操奪回。,"Then Wen Chou turned to come back. Xu Huang, whirling his battle-ax, stood in his way to stop Wen Chou. But Xu Huang saw behind Wen Chou several more horsemen coming to help; and as they would have been too many for him, he fled. Wen Chou pursued along the river bank. Suddenly he saw coming toward him with banners fluttering in the breeze, a small party of horse, and the leader carried a great sword.""Stop!"" cried Guan Yu, for it was he, and he attacked at once.At the third bout Wen Chou's heart failed him, and he wheeled and fled, following the windings of the river. But Guan Yu's steed was fast and soon caught up. One blow, and the hapless Wen Chou fell.When Cao Cao saw from the mound that the leader of the enemy had fallen, he gave the signal for a general onset, and half of the northern army were drowned in the river. And the carts with supplies and all the horses were quickly recovered."
雲長引數騎東衝西突。正殺之間，劉玄德領三萬軍隨後到。前面哨馬探知，報與玄德云：「今番又是紅面長髯的斬了文醜。」玄德慌忙驟馬來看，隔河望見一簇人馬，往來如飛，旗上寫著「漢壽亭侯關雲長」七字。玄德暗謝天地曰：「原來吾弟果然在曹操處！」欲待招呼相見，被曹兵大隊擁來，只得收兵回去。袁紹接應官渡，下定寨柵。郭圖、審配入見袁紹，說：「今番又是關某殺了文醜，劉備佯推不知。」袁紹大怒，罵曰：「大耳賊焉敢如此！」,"Now Guan Yu, at the head of a few horsemen, was thrusting here and striking there at the moment when Liu Bei, with the thirty thousand reserve troops, appeared on the battle field on the other bank of the river. At once they told him that the red-faced, long-bearded warrior was there and had slain Wen Chou. Liu Bei hastily pressed forward to try to get a look at the warrior. He saw across the river a body of horse and the banners bore the words Guan Yu, Lord of Hanshou.""Then it is my brother, and he is really with Cao Cao,"" said Liu Bei, secretly thanking God that Guan Yu was safe.Liu Bei made an attempt to wait about till he could call to Guan Yu, but a great mass of Cao Cao's soldiers came rushing down, and he was forced to retire.Yuan Shao, bringing reinforcements, reached Guandu and built a stockade.Two advisers, Guo Tu and Shen Pei, went in to see him and said, ""Again that fellow Guan Yu has been in the battle. He killed Wen Chou. Liu Bei pretends ignorance of him.""Their master was angry and railed at Liu Bei, ""The long-eared rebel! How dare he do such a thing?"""
少頃，玄德至，紹令推出斬之。玄德曰：「某有何罪？」紹曰：「你故使汝弟又壞我一員大將，如何無罪？」玄德曰：「容伸一言而死。曹操素忌備，今知備在明公處，恐備助公，故特使雲長誅殺二將。公知必怒。此借公之手以殺劉備也，願明公思之。」袁紹曰：「玄德之言是也。汝等幾使我受害賢之名。」喝退左右，請玄德上帳而坐。,"Soon Liu Bei appeared. Again Yuan Shao ordered him out to instant execution.""What crime have I committed?"" asked Liu Bei.""You sent your brother to slay one of my generals. Is that no crime?""""Pray let me explain before I die. Cao Cao hated me and has always done so. Now he has found out where I am and, fearing that I may help you, has got my brother to destroy your two generals, feeling sure that when you heard of it, you would be angry and put me to death. You cannot fail to see this.""""What he says is sense,"" said Yuan Shao, turning to his advisers, ""and you two nearly brought on me the reproach of injuring the good.""Yuan Shao ordered his attendants to retire and asked Liu Bei to come and sit by him."
玄德謝曰：「荷明公寬大之恩，無可補報，欲令一心腹人持密書去見雲長，使知劉備消息，彼必星夜來到，輔佐明公，共誅曹操，以報顏良、文醜之讎，若何？」袁紹大喜曰：「吾得雲長，勝顏良、文醜十倍也。」玄德修下書札，未有人送去。紹令退軍武陽，連營數十里，按兵不動。操乃使夏侯惇領兵守住官渡隘口，自己班師回許都，大宴眾官，賀雲長之功。因謂呂虔曰：「昔日吾以糧草在前者，乃餌敵之計也。惟荀公達知吾心耳。」眾皆歎服。,"Liu Bei came, saying, ""I am deeply thankful, Illustrious Sir, for your great kindness, for which I can never be sufficiently grateful. Now I desire to send some confidential messenger with a secret letter to my brother to tell him where I am, and I am sure he will come without a moment's delay. He will help you to destroy Cao Cao to make up for having destroyed your two officers. Do you approve of this?""""If I got Guan Yu, he would be ten times better than the Yan Liang and Wen Chou that I have lost,"" replied Yuan Shao.So Liu Bei prepared a letter. But there was no one to take it. Yuan Shao ordered the army to withdraw to Wuyang, where they made a large camp. For some time nothing was done.Then Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to defend the strategic points at Guandu while he led the bulk of the army back to the capital. There he gave many banquets in honor of the services of Guan Yu, and then he told Lu Qian that putting the supplies in the front of the army had been meant as a bait to draw the enemy to destruction.""Only Xun You understood that,"" said Cao Cao in conclusion. Everyone present praised his ingenuity."
正飲宴間，忽報「汝南有黃巾劉辟、龔都，甚是猖獗。曹洪累戰不利，乞遺兵救之。」雲長聞言，進曰：「關某願施犬馬之勞，破汝南賊寇。」操曰：「雲長建立大功，未曾重酬，豈可復勞征進？」公曰：「關某久閒，必生疾病。」曹操壯之，點兵五萬，使于禁、樂進為副將，次日便行。荀彧密謂操曰：「雲長有歸劉之心，倘知消息必去，不可頻令出征。」操曰：「今次收功，吾不復教臨敵矣。」,"Even while the banquet was proceeding, there arrived news of a rising of Yellow Scarves rebels at Runan led by Liu Pi and Gong Du. They were very strong, and Cao Hong had been defeated in several engagements. Now he begged for help.Guan Yu hearing this said, ""I should like to have the opportunity of performing some service by destroying these rebels.""""You have already rendered noble services for which you have not been properly requited. I could hardly trouble you again,"" said Cao Cao.""I have been idle too long. I shall get ill,"" said Guan Yu.Cao Cao then let him to go and gave him fifty thousand troops with Yu Jin and Yue Jing as generals under him. They were to leave soon.Then Xun Yu said privily to his master, ""He always cherishes the idea of returning to Liu Bei. He will leave you if he hears any news. Do not let him go on this expedition.""""If he does well this time, I will not let him go into battle again,"" said Cao Cao."
且說雲長領兵將近汝南，劄住營寨。當夜營外拏了兩個細作人來。雲長視之，內中認得一人，乃孫乾也。關公叱退左右，問乾曰：「公自潰散之後，一向跡不聞，今何為在此處？」乾曰：「某自逃難，飄泊汝南，幸得劉辟收留。今將軍為何在曹操處？未識甘、糜二夫人無恙否？」,"In due time the force led by Guan Yu drew near the rebels in Runan and made their camp. One night, just outside his camp, two spies were caught and taken in to Guan Yu who in one of them recognized Sun Qian. The attendants being dismissed, Guan Yu questioned Sun Qian.""After we lost sight of each other, I have heard not a word of you. What are you doing here?"" said Guan Yu.""After I escaped, I drifted hither and thither till I had the good fortune to reach Runan, and Liu Pi and Gong Du, the Yellow Scarves leaders, took me in. But why are you with Cao Cao, General? And where are your sisters-in-law? Are they well?"""
關公因將上項事，細說一遍。乾曰：「近聞玄德公在袁紹處，欲往投之，未得其便。今劉、龔二人歸順袁紹，相助攻曹。又幸得將軍到此，因特令小軍引路，教某為細作，來報將軍。來日二人當虛敗一陣，公可速引二夫人投袁紹處，與玄德公相見。」關公曰：「既兄在袁紹處，吾必星夜而往。但恨吾斬紹二將，恐今事變矣。」乾曰：「吾當先往探彼虛實，再來報將軍。」公曰：「吾見兄長一面，雖萬死不辭。今回許昌，便辭曹操也。」當夜密送孫乾去了。,"Guan Yu told him all that had happened.""I have heard lately that Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao. I would have liked to go and join him, but I have not found a convenient opportunity. Now the two men I am with have taken the side of Yuan Shao against Cao Cao. By good luck you were coming here, so I got command of a small party of scouts to be able to see you and tell you. Presently our two leaders will pretend to be defeated and you, and the two ladies, can go over to Yuan Shao. And you will see your brother.""""Since he is there, I certainly must go at once to see him. But it is a misfortune that I have slain two of Yuan Shao's generals. I fear things are not in my favor,"" said Guan Yu.""Let me go first and see how the land lies. I will come back and tell you.""""I would risk a myriad deaths to see my brother,"" said Guan Yu. ""But I must go to say farewell to Cao Cao.""Sun Qian was sent away that night."
次日，關公引兵出，龔都披挂出陣。關公曰：「汝等何故背反朝廷？」都曰：「汝乃背主之人，何反責我？」關公曰：「我為何背主？」都曰：「劉玄德在袁本初處，汝卻從曹操，何也？」關公更不打話，拍馬舞刀向前。龔都便走，關公趕上。都回身告關公曰：「故主之恩，不可忘也。公當速進，我讓汝南。」關公會意，驅軍掩殺。劉、龔二人佯輸詐敗，四散去了。雲長奪得州縣，安民已定，班師回許昌。曹操出郭迎接，賞勞軍士。,"The next day Guan Yu led out his army to offer battle. Gong Du, in armor, went out to the front of the line of battle, and Guan Yu said, ""You people, why have you risen against the government?""""Why do you blame us when you have turned your back on your own lord?"" replied Gong Du.""How have I turned my back on my lord?""""Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao, and you are with Cao Cao. What is that?""Guan Yu could not reply, but he whirled round his sword and rode forward. Gong Du fled, and Guan Yu followed. Gong Du turned and said to Guan Yu, ""Do not forget your old chief's kindness. Now attack as soon as you can, and I will give up the defense.""Guan Yu understood and urged on his troops. The leaders of the rebels pretended they were worsted, and they all scattered. So Runan was retaken. Having pacified the people, Guan Yu quickly led his army back to the capital, where he was met by Cao Cao and congratulated on his success and feasted."
宴罷，雲長回家，參拜二嫂於門外。甘夫人曰：「叔叔兩番出軍，可知皇叔音信否？」公答曰：「未也。」關公退，二夫人於門內痛哭曰：「想皇叔休矣！二叔恐我姊妹煩惱，故隱而不言。」,"When this was all over, Guan Yu went to the dwelling of his sisters-in-law to pay his respects at their gate.""Have you been able to get any news of Uncle Liu Bei in your two expeditions?"" asked Lady Gan.""None,"" replied Guan Yu.As he retired from the door, he heard sounds of bitter weeping within.""Alas! He is dead,"" said they. ""Our brother-in-law thinks we shall be greatly distressed; and thus, he hides the truth from us."""
正哭間，有一隨行老軍，聽得哭不絕，於門外告曰：「夫人休哭。主人見在河北袁紹處。」夫人曰：「汝何由知之？」軍曰：「跟關將軍出征，有人在陣上說來。」夫人急召雲長責之曰：「皇叔未嘗負汝，汝今受曹操之恩，頓忘舊日之義，不以實情告我，何也？」關公頓首曰：「兄今委實在河北；未敢教嫂嫂知者，恐有洩漏也。事須緩圖，不可欲速。」甘夫人曰：「叔宜上緊。」公退，尋思去計，坐立不安。原來于禁探知劉備在河北，報與曹操。操令張遼來探關公意。,"One of the old soldiers, who acted as guard, hearing the sounds of perpetual grief, took pity on them and said, ""Do not weep, ladies. Your lord is with Yuan Shao in the North of Yellow River.""""How do you know that?"" said they.""I went out with General Guan Yu, and one of the soldiers told me.""The two ladies summoned Guan Yu and reproached him, saying, ""Uncle Liu Bei never betrayed you, and yet you remain here enjoying the bounty of Cao Cao and forgetting the old times. And you tell us falsehoods.""Guan Yu bowed his head, saying, ""My brother really is in the North of Yellow River, but I dared not tell you, lest it should become known. Something must be done, but done carefully, and it needs time.""""Brother-in-law, you should hasten,"" said Lady Gan.Guan Yu withdrew feeling that he must evolve some scheme of departure without further loss of time. It caused him much uneasiness.Yu Jin, having found out that Liu Bei was in the north, told Cao Cao, who at once sent Zhang Liao to find out Guan Yu's intentions."
關公正悶坐，張遼入賀曰：「聞兄在陣上知玄德音信，特來賀喜。」關公曰：「故主雖在，未得一見，何喜之有？」遼曰：「公與玄德交，比弟與兄交何如？」公曰：「我與兄，朋友之交也；我與玄德，是朋友而兄弟、兄弟而又君臣也。豈可共論乎？」遼曰：「今玄德在河北，兄往從否？」關公曰：「昔日之言，安肯背之？文遠須為我致意丞相。」張遼將關公之言，回告曹操。操曰：「吾自有計留之。」,"Zhang Liao entered jauntily and congratulated Guan Yu, saying, ""They tell me you obtained news of your brother in the battlefield. I felicitate you.""""My lord was there indeed, but I met him not. I see nothing to be glad about.""""Is there any difference between the relationship of you two and that of any other two brothers?""Guan Yu replied, ""You and I stand in the relationship of friends. Liu Bei and I are friends and brothers beside, and prince and minister in addition to both. Our relationship cannot be discussed in usual terms.""""Well, now that you know where your brother is, are you going to him?""""How can I go back on what I said before? I am sure you will explain fully to the Prime Minister.""Zhang Liao went back and told his master, who said, ""I must find a way to keep him here."""
且說關公正尋思間，忽報有故人相訪。及請入，卻不相識。關公問曰：「公何人也？」答曰：「某乃袁紹部下南陽陳震也。」關公大驚，急退左右，問曰：「先生此來，必有所為？」震出書一緘，遞與關公。公視之，乃玄德書也。其略云：,"While Guan Yu was pondering over his difficulties, they told him that a friend had come to inquire for him. The visitor was introduced but Guan Yu did not recognize him.""Who are you?"" asked Guan Yu.""I am Chen Zhen of Nanyang, in the service of Yuan Shao.""In great perturbation, Guan Yu sent away the attendants and, they being gone, said, ""There is some special reason for your visit?""For reply Chen Zhen drew out a letter and handed it to his host, who recognized that it was from his brother Liu Bei. The letter read:"
備與足下，自桃園締盟，誓以同死；今何中道相違，割恩斷義？君必欲取功名，圖富貴，願獻備首級以成全功！書不盡言，死待來命！,"""I, the writer, and you, Sir, pledged ourselves in the Peach Garden to die together. Why then are we apart and yet alive, our kindly feelings destroyed, our sense of right outraged? If you desire to obtain fame and acquire riches and honor, I will offer my head without hesitation so that your achievement is fulfilled. More might be said, but I await your commands with great anxiety."""
關公看書畢，大哭曰：「某非不欲尋兄，奈不知所在也。安肯圖富貴而背舊盟乎？」震曰：「玄德望公甚切，公既不背舊盟，宜速往見。」關公曰：「人生天地間，無終始者，非君子也。吾來時明白，去時不可不明白。吾今作書，煩公先達知兄長，容某辭卻曹操，奉二嫂來相見。震曰：「倘曹操不允，為之奈何？」公曰：「吾寧死，豈肯久留於此？」震曰：「公速作回書，免致劉使君懸望。」關公寫書答云：,"Guan Yu finished the letter with a bitter cry.""I always wanted to find my brother, but I did not know where he was. How can he think such evil of me?"" said he.""Liu Bei looks for you very eagerly. If you are still bound by the old pledge, you should go quickly,"" said Chen Zhen.""Anyone born into the world without the essential virtue of sincerity is no true human. I came here openly and can go in no other way. Now will I write a letter which I will ask you to bear to my brother, that as soon as I can take leave of Cao Cao, I will bring the ladies and come to him.""""But what if Cao Cao refuse to let you go?"" said Chen Zhen.""Then would I rather die. I will not remain here.""""Then, Sir, quickly write your letter and relieve your brother from his anxiety.""So Guan Yu wrote like this:"
竊聞義不負心，忠不願死。羽自幼讀書，粗知禮義，觀羊角哀、左伯桃之事，未嘗不三歎而流涕也。,"""I, the humble one, know full well that a human of principle does not betray and a human of loyalty despises death. I have been a student in my youth and know somewhat of the proprieties. I sigh and weep at the memory of the fraternal affection that made Yangjue Ai and Zuo Botao die rather than separate."
前守下邳，內無積粟，外無援兵；欲即效死，奈有二嫂之重，未敢斷首捐軀，致負所託；故爾暫且羈身，冀圖後會。近至汝南，方知兄信；即當面辭曹操，奉二嫂歸。羽但懷異心，神人共戮。披肝瀝膽，筆楮難窮。瞻拜有期，伏惟照鑒！,"I was in charge of Xiapi, but the place lacked provision and there was no help. I would have fought to the death, but there was on my shoulders the responsibility for my sisters-in-law. Wherefore I had to take care of my body lest I betrayed your trust. And so I made a prisoner of myself, hoping to find a way of release. I heard of you lately in Runan. I must, however, bid farewell to Cao Cao and bring the ladies with me when I come. May I perish, victim to the superhuman powers, if I have harbored any traitorous thought. Ink and paper are poor substitutes for what I would say, but I look to see you soon."""
陳震得書自回。關公入內告知二嫂，隨即至相府，拜辭曹操。操知來意，乃懸迴避牌於門。關公怏怏而回，命舊日跟隨人役，收拾車馬，早晚伺候；分付宅中，所有原賜之物，盡皆留下，分毫不可帶去。次日再往相府辭謝，門首又挂迴避牌。關公一連去了數次，皆不得見；乃往張遼家相探，欲言其事，遼亦託疾不出。關公思曰：「此曹丞相不容我去之意。我去志已決，豈可復留？」即寫書一封，辭謝曹操。書略曰：,"Chen Zhen left with this missive, and Guan Yu went to tell the women. Then he proceeded to the Prime Minister's palace to say farewell. But Cao Cao knew what he was coming for, and at the gate Guan Yu found the board intimating that no one could be received. So he had to return. However, he bade his own few soldiers prepare to start at any moment. He also gave orders that everything received from Cao Cao was to be left in the quarters. Nothing was to be taken.Next day he again proceeded to the palace to say farewell to his patron, but again found the board hanging there to show there was no admission. So it was several times; he could never enter. Then he went to see Zhang Liao, but Zhang Liao was indisposed.""This means Cao Cao will not let me go,"" thought Guan Yu. ""But I am going, and I shall hesitate no longer.""So he wrote this letter:"
羽少事皇叔，誓同生死；皇天后土，實聞斯言。前者下邳失守，所請三事，已蒙恩諾。今探知故主現在袁紹軍中，回思昔日之盟，豈容違背？新恩雖厚，舊義難忘。茲特奉書告辭，伏惟照察。其有餘恩未報，願以俟之異日。,"""As a young man I entered the service of the Imperial Uncle, and pledged myself to share his fortunes. Heaven and Earth witnessed this oath. When I lost the city, I made three requests which you granted. Now I hear my brother is with Yuan Shao and I, remembering our pledge, cannot but go to him. Though your bounty is great, I forget not the bond of the past; wherefore I write this letter of farewell trusting that when you have read it, you will be content for me to postpone to another season the proof of my gratitude."""
寫畢封固，差人去相府投遞；一面將累次所受金銀，一一封置庫中，懸漢壽亭侯印於堂上，請二夫人上車。關公上赤兔馬，手提青龍刀，率領舊日跟隨人役，護送車仗，逕出北門。門吏擋之。關公怒目橫刀，大喝一聲，門吏皆退避。關公既出門，謂從者曰：「汝等護立車仗先行，但有追趕者，吾自當之，勿得驚動二位夫人。」從者推車，望官道進發。,"Guan Yu sealed and sent it to the palace. Then he deposited in the treasury of his dwelling all the gold and silver he had received, hung his seal of lordship of Hanshou in the middle of the reception hall and left, taking his sisters-in-law with him in a carriage. He rode Red Hare and carried the green-dragon saber in his hand. With a small escort of guards, those formerly under his command, he left the city by the north gate.The wardens would have stopped him, but Guan Yu frightened them with a fierce shout. Having got out, he told the escort to go in front with the carriage while he would remain behind to guard against pursuit. So they pushed the carriage toward the high road."
卻說曹操正論關公之事未定，左右報關公呈書。操即看畢，大驚曰：「雲長去矣！」忽北門守將飛報：「關公奪門而去，車仗鞍馬二十餘人，皆望北行。」又關公宅中人來報說：「關公盡封所賜金銀等物。美女十人，另居內室。其漢壽亭侯印懸於堂上。丞相所撥人役，皆不帶去，只帶原跟從人，及隨身行李，出北門去了。」眾皆愕然。一將挺身出曰：「某願將鐵騎三千，去生擒關某，獻與丞相！」眾視之，乃將軍蔡陽也。正是：欲離萬丈蛟龍穴，又遇三千狼虎兵。蔡陽要趕關公，畢竟如何，且看下文分解。,"In the city, Guan Yu's letter reached the Prime Minister while he was consulting about what to do. He read it and exclaimed, ""So he has left!""Then the warden of the gate came to report that Guan Yu had forced his way out, and was gone with a carriage, a horse, and a score of guards. Next came the servants from his house to report that he had left, taking nothing of the treasure, nor anyone of the waiting maids. Everything was left in the house. Even his seal was there. His only escort were the few soldiers of his original force.Suddenly from the assembly of officers rose a voice, saying, ""With three thousand of mailed horse, I will bring him back alive.""Their eyes turned to the speaker, who was General Cai Yang.On the dragon's cave he turns his back,But numberless wolves infest his track.What came of this offer to pursue will be seen in the next chapter."
