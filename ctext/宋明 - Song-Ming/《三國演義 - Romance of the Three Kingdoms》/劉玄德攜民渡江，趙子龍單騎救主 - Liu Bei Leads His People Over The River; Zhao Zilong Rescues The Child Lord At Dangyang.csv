卻說張飛因關公放了上流水，遂引軍從下流殺將來，截住曹仁混殺。忽遇許褚，便與交鋒。許褚不敢戀戰，奪路走脫。張飛趕來，接著玄德、孔明，一同沿河到上流。劉封、糜芳，已安排船隻等候，遂一齊渡河，盡望樊城而去。孔明教將船筏放火燒毀。,"The last chapter closed with the attack made by Zhang Fei as soon as his brother had let loose the waters on the doomed army. He met with Xu Chu and a combat began, but a fight with such a warrior was not to Xu Chu's taste and he ran away. Zhang Fei followed till he came upon Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang, and the three went upstream till they came to the boats that had been prepared by Liu Feng and Mi Fang, when they all crossed over and marched toward Fancheng. As soon as they disembarked, Zhuge Liang ordered the boats and rafts to be burned."
卻說曹仁收拾殘軍，就新野屯住，使曹洪去見曹操，具言失利之事。操大怒曰：「諸葛村夫，安敢如此！」催動三軍，漫山塞野，盡至新野下寨；傳令軍士一面搜山，一面填塞白河；令大軍分作八路，一齊去取樊城。劉曄曰：「丞相初至襄陽，必須先買民心。今劉備盡遷新野百姓入樊城，若我兵逕進，二縣為虀粉矣；不如先使人招降劉備。備即不降，亦可見我愛民之心；若其來降，則荊州之地，可不戰而定也。」,"Cao Ren gathered in the remnants of his army and camped at Xinye, while his colleague Cao Hong went to tell their lord the evil tidings of defeat.""How dare he, this rustic Zhuge Liang!"" exclaimed Cao Cao angrily.Cao Cao then hastily sent an overwhelming army to camp near the place and gave orders for enormous works against the city, leveling hills and turning rivers to launch a violent assault on Fancheng from every side at once.Then Liu Ye came in to see his lord and said, ""Sir, you are new to this region, and you should win over the people's hearts. Liu Bei has moved all the people from Xinye to Fancheng. If we march through the country, the people will be ground to powder. It would be well to call upon Liu Bei first to surrender, which will prove to the people that you have a care for them. If he yields, then we get Jingzhou without fighting."""
操從其言，便問：「誰可為使？」劉曄曰：「徐庶與劉備至厚，今現在軍中，何不命他一往？」操曰：「他去恐不復來。」曄曰：「他若不來，貽笑於人矣。丞相勿疑。」操乃召徐庶至，謂曰：「我今欲踏平樊城，奈憐眾百姓之命。公可往說劉備：如肯來降，免罪賜爵；若更執迷，軍民共戮，玉石俱焚。吾知公忠義，故特使公往，願勿相負。」,"Cao Cao agreed and asked who would be a suitable messenger. Liu Ye suggested Xu Shu.""He is a close friend of Liu Bei, and he is here with the army,"" said Liu Ye.""But he will not come back,"" objected Cao Cao.""If he does not return, he will be a laughing stock to the whole world. He will come back.""Xu Shu was sent for, and Cao Cao said, ""My first intention was to level Fancheng with the ground. But out of pity for its people, you may carry an offer to Liu Bei that if he will surrender, he will not only not be punished but he shall be given rank. But if he holds on his present misguided course, the whole of his followers shall be destroyed. Now you are an honest man and so I confide this mission to you, and I trust you will not disappoint me."""
徐庶受命而行，至樊城。玄德、孔明接見，共訴舊日之情。庶曰：「曹操使庶來招降使君，乃假買民心也。今彼分兵八路，填白河而進，樊城恐不可守，宜速作行計。」玄德欲留徐庶。庶謝曰：「某若不還，恐惹人笑。今老母已喪，抱恨終天。身雖在彼，誓不為設一謀。公有臥龍輔佐，何愁大業不成？庶請辭。」,"Xu Shu said nothing but accepted his orders and went to the city, where he was received by both Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. They enjoyed a talk over old times before Xu Shu mentioned the object of his mission.Then he said, ""Cao Cao has sent me to invite you to surrender, thereby making a bid for popularity. But you ought also to know that he intends to attack the city from every point, that he is damming up the White River's waters to be sent against you, and I fear you will not be able to hold the city. You ought to prepare.""Liu Bei asked Xu Shu to remain with them, but Xu Shu said, ""That is impossible, for all the world would ridicule me if I stayed. My old mother is dead, and I never forget my resentment. My body may be over there, but I swear never to form a plan for Cao Cao. You have the Sleeping Dragon to help you and need have no anxiety about the ultimate achievement of your undertaking. But I must go.""And Xu Shu took his leave."
玄德不敢強留。徐庶辭回，見了曹操，言玄德並無降意。操大怒，即日進兵。玄德問計於孔明，孔明曰：「可速棄樊城，取襄陽暫歇。」玄德曰：「奈百姓相隨許久，安忍棄之？」孔明曰：「可令人遍告百姓：有願隨者同去，不願者留下。」先使雲長往江岸整頓船隻，令孫乾、簡雍，在城中聲揚曰：「令曹兵將至，孤城不可久守，百姓願隨者便同過江。」,"Liu Bei felt he could not press his friend to stay. Xu Shu returned to Cao Cao's camp and reported that Liu Bei had no intention of surrender. This angered Cao Cao who gave orders to begin the advance and siege.When Liu Bei asked what Zhuge Liang meant to do, Zhuge Liang replied, ""We shall abandon Fancheng and take Xiangyang.""""But what of the people who have followed us? They cannot be abandoned.""""You can tell them to do as they wish. They may come if they like, or remain here.""They sent Guan Yu to prepare boats and told Sun Qian to proclaim to the people that Cao Cao was coming, that the city could not be defended, and those who wished to do so might cross the river with the army."
兩縣之民，齊聲大呼曰：「我等雖死，亦願隨使君！」即日號泣而行。扶老攜幼，將男帶女，滾滾渡河，兩岸哭聲不絕。玄德於船上望見，大慟曰：「為吾一人而使百姓遭此大難，吾何生哉！」欲投江而死，左右急救止，聞者莫不痛哭。船到南岸，回顧百姓，有未渡者，望南而哭。玄德急令雲長催船渡之，方纔上馬。行至襄陽東門，只見城上遍插旌旗，壕邊密布鹿角。玄德勒馬大叫曰：「劉琮賢姪，吾但欲救百姓，並無他念，可快開門。」,"All the people cried, ""We will follow the Prince even if it be to death!""They started at once, some lamenting, some weeping, the young helping the aged, parents leading their children, the strong soldiers carrying the women. As the crowds crossed the river, from both banks arose the sound of lamentation.Liu Bei was much affected as he saw all this from the boat.""Why was I ever born,"" said he, ""to be the cause of all this misery to the people?""He made to leap into the river, but they held him back. All were deeply sympathetic. When the boat reached the southern shore, he looked back at the weeping crowds waiting still on the other bank and was again moved to tears. He bade Guan Yu hasten the boats before he mounted and rode on.When Xiangyang came in sight, they saw many flags flying on the walls and that the moat was protected by barbed barriers.Liu Bei checked his horse and called out, ""Liu Zong, good nephew! I only wish to save the people and nothing more. I pray you quickly open the gates."""
劉琮聞玄德至，懼而不出。蔡瑁、張允，逕來敵樓上，叱軍士亂箭射下。城外百姓，皆望敵樓而哭。城中忽有一將，引數百人逕上城樓，大喝：「蔡瑁、張允，賣國之賊！劉使君乃仁德之人，今為救民而來投，何得相拒！」眾觀其人，身長八尺，面如重棗；乃義陽人也，姓魏，名延，字文長。,"But Liu Zong was too frightened to appear. Cai Mao and Zhang Yun went up to one of the fighting towers and ordered the soldiers to shoot arrows down on those without the walls. The people gazed up at the towers and wept aloud.Suddenly there appeared a general, with a small following, who cried out, ""Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are two traitors. The princely Liu Bei is a most upright man and has come here to preserve his people. Why do you repulse him?""All looked at this man. He was of eight-span height, with a face dark brown as a ripe date. He was from Yiyang and named Wei Yan."
當下魏延輪刀砍死守門將士，開了城門，放下弔橋，大叫：「劉皇叔快領兵入城，共殺賣國之賊！」張飛便躍馬欲入。玄德急止之曰：「休驚百姓！」魏延只管招呼玄德軍馬入城。只見城內一將飛馬引軍而出，大喝：「魏延無名小卒，安敢造亂！認得我大將文聘麼！」魏延大怒，挺槍躍馬，便來交戰。,"At that moment he looked very terrible, whirling his sword as if about to slice up the gate guards. They lost no time in throwing open the gate and dropping the bridge.""Come in, Uncle Liu Bei,"" cried Wei Yan, ""and bring your army to slay these traitors!""Zhang Fei plunged forward to take Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, but he was checked by his brother, who said, ""Do not frighten the people!""Thus Wei Yan let in Liu Bei. As soon as he entered, he saw a general galloping up with a few men.The newcomer yelled, ""Wei Yan, you nobody! How dare you create trouble? Do you not know me, General Wen Ping?""Wei Yan turned angrily, set his spear, and galloped forward to attack the general."
兩下軍兵在城邊混殺，喊聲大震。玄德曰：「本欲保民，反害民也！吾不願入襄陽！」孔明曰：「江陵乃荊州要地，不如先取江陵為家。」玄德曰：「正合吾心。」於是引著百姓，盡離襄陽大路，望江陵而走。襄陽城中百姓，多有乘亂逃出城來，跟玄德而去。魏延與文聘交戰，從已至未，手下兵卒，皆已折盡。延乃撥馬而逃，卻尋不見玄德，自投長沙太守韓玄去了。,"The soldiers joined in the fray and the noise of battle rose to the skies.""I wanted to preserve the people, and I am only causing them injury,"" cried Liu Bei distressed. ""I do not wish to enter the city.""""Jiangling is an important point. We will first take that as a place to dwell in,"" said Zhuge Liang.""That pleases me greatly,"" said Liu Bei.So they led the people thither and away from Xiangyang. Many of the inhabitants of that city took advantage of the confusion to escape, and they also joined themselves to Liu Bei.Meanwhile, within the inhospitable city, Wei Yan and Wen Ping fought. The battle continued for four or five watches, all through the middle of the day, and nearly all the combatants fell. Then Wei Yan got away. As he could not find Liu Bei, he rode off to Changsha and sought an asylum with Governor Han Xuan."
卻說玄德同行軍民十餘萬，大小車數千輛，挑擔背包者不計其數。路過劉表之墓，玄德率眾將拜於墓前，哭告曰：「辱弟備無德無才，負兄寄託之重，罪在備一身，與百姓無干。望兄英靈，垂救荊襄之民！」言甚悲切，軍民無不下淚。,"Liu Bei wandered away from the city of Xiangyang that had refused shelter. Soldiers and people, his following numbered more than a hundred thousand. The carts numbered scores of thousands, and the burden bearers were innumerable. Their road led them past the tomb of Liu Biao, and Liu Bei turned aside to bow at the grave.He lamented, saying, ""Shameful is thy brother, lacking both in virtue and in talents. I refused to bear the burden you wished to lay upon me, wherein I was wrong. But the people committed no sin. I pray your glorious spirit descend and rescue these people.""His prayer was fraught with sorrow, and all those about him wept."
忽哨馬報說：「曹操大軍已屯樊城，使人收拾船筏，即日渡江趕來也。」眾將皆曰：「江陵要地，足可拒守。今擁民眾數萬，日行十餘里，似此幾時得至江陵？倘曹兵到，如何迎敵？不如暫棄百姓，先行為上。」玄德泣曰：「舉大事者必以人為本。今人歸我，奈何棄之？」百姓聞玄德此言，莫不傷感。後人有詩讚之曰：,"Just then a scout rode up with the news that Fancheng was already taken by Cao Cao and that his army were preparing boats and rafts to cross the river.The generals of Liu Bei said, ""Jiangling is a defensible shelter, but with this crowd we can only advance very slowly, and when can we reach the city? If Cao Cao pursue, we shall be in a parlous state. Our counsel is to leave the people to their fate for a time and press on to Jiangling.""But Liu Bei wept, saying, ""The success of every great enterprise depends upon humanity. How can I abandon these people who have joined me?""Those who heard him repeat this noble sentiment were greatly affected."
臨難仁心存百姓，登舟揮淚動三軍。至今憑弔襄江口，父老猶然憶使君。,"In time of stress his heart was tender toward the people,And he wept as he went down into the ship,Moving the hearts of soldiers to sympathy.Even today, in the countryside,Fathers and elders recall the Princely One's kindness."
卻說玄德擁著百姓，緩緩而行。孔明曰：「追兵不久即至，可遺雲長往江夏求救公子劉琦，教他速起兵乘船會於江陵。」玄德從之，即修書令雲長同孫乾領五百軍往江夏求救；令張飛斷後；趙雲保護老小；其餘俱管顧百姓而行。每日只走十餘里便歇。,"The progress of Liu Bei, with the crowd of people in his train, was very slow.""The pursuers will be upon us quickly,"" said Zhuge Liang. ""Let us send Guan Yu to Jiangxia for succor. Liu Qi should be told to bring soldiers and prepare boats for us at Jiangling.""Liu Bei agreed to this and wrote a letter which he sent by the hands of Guan Yu and Sun Qian and five hundred troops. Zhang Fei was put in command of the rear guard. Zhao Zilong was told to guard Liu Bei's family, while the others ordered the march of the people.They only traveled three or four miles daily and the halts were frequent."
卻說曹操在樊城，使人渡江至襄陽，召劉琮相見。琮懼怕不敢往見，蔡瑁、張允請行。王威密告琮曰：「將軍既降，玄德又走，曹操必懈弛無備。願將軍奮整奇兵，設於險處擊之，操可獲矣。獲操則威震天下，中原雖廣，可傳檄而定。此難遇之機，不可失也。」,"Meanwhile Cao Cao was at Fancheng, whence he sent troops over the river toward Xiangyang. He summoned Liu Zong, but Liu Zong was too afraid to answer the call. No persuasion could get him to go.Wang Wei said to him privately, ""Now you can overcome Cao Cao if you are wise. Since you have announced surrender and Liu Bei has gone away, Cao Cao will relax his precautions, and you can catch him unawares. Send a well-prepared but unexpected force to waylay him in some commanding position, and the thing is done. If you were to take Cao Cao prisoner, your fame would run throughout the empire, and the land would be yours for the taking. This is a sort of opportunity that does not recur, and you should not miss it."""
琮以其言告蔡瑁。瑁叱王威曰：「汝不知天命，安敢妄言！」威怒罵曰：「賣國之徒，吾恨不生啖汝肉！」瑁欲殺之，蒯越勸止。瑁遂與張允同至樊城，拜見曹操。瑁等辭色甚是諂佞。操問：「荊州軍馬錢糧，今有多少？」瑁曰：「馬軍五萬，步軍十五萬，水軍八萬：共二十八萬。錢糧大半在江陵。其餘各處，亦足供給一載。」操曰：「戰船多少？原是何人管領？」瑁曰：「大小戰船，共七千餘隻，原是瑁等二人掌管。」,"The young man consulted Cai Mao, who called Wang Wei an evil counselor and spoke to him harshly.""You are mad! You know nothing and understand nothing of destiny,"" said Cai Mao.Wang Wei angrily retorted, saying, ""Cai Mao is the betrayer of the country, and I wish I could eat him alive!""The quarrel waxed deadly, and Cai Mao wanted to slay Wang Wei. But eventually peace was restored by Kuai Yue.Then Cai Mao and Zhang Yun went to Fancheng to see Cao Cao.Cai Mao was by instinct specious and flattering, and when his host asked concerning the resources of Jingzhou, he replied, ""There are fifty thousand of horse, one hundred fifty thousand of foot, and eighty thousand of marines. Most of the money and grain are at Jiangling. The rest is stored at various places. There are ample supplies for a year.""""How many war vessels are there? Who is in command?"" said Cao Cao.""The ships, of all sizes, number seven thousands, and we two are the commanders."""
操遂加瑁為鎮南侯水軍大都督、張允為助順侯水軍副都督。二人大喜拜謝。操又曰：「劉景升既死，其子降順，吾當表奏天子，使永為荊州之主。」二人大喜而退。荀攸曰：「蔡瑁、張允，乃諂佞之徒，主公何遂加以如此顯爵，更教都督水軍乎？」操笑曰：「吾豈不識人？止因吾所領北地之眾，不習水戰，故且權用此二人；待成事之後，別有理會。」,"Upon this Cao Cao conferred upon Cai Mao the title of the Lord Who Controls the South, and Supreme Admiral of the Naval Force; and Zhang Yun was his Vice-Admiral with the title of the Lord Who Brings Obedience.When they went to thank Cao Cao for these honors, he told them, saying, ""I am about to propose to the Throne that Liu Biao's son should be perpetual Imperial Protector of Jingzhou in succession to his late father.""With this promise for their young master and the honors for themselves, they retired.Then Xun You asked Cao Cao, ""Why these two evident self-seekers and flatterers have been treated so generously?""Cao Cao replied, ""Do I not know all about them? Only in the north, where we have been, we know very little of war by water, and these two men do. I want their help for the present. When my end is achieved, I can do as I like with them."""
卻說蔡瑁、張允歸見劉琮，具言曹操許保奏將軍永鎮荊襄。琮大喜；次日，與母蔡夫人齎捧印綬兵符，親自渡江拜迎曹操。操撫慰畢，即引隨征軍將，進屯襄陽城外。蔡瑁、張允令襄陽百姓，焚香拜接。曹操俱用好言撫諭；入城至府中坐定，即召蒯越近前，撫慰曰：「吾不喜得荊州，喜得異度也。」遂封蒯越為江陵太守樊城侯。傅巽、王粲等皆為關內侯；而以劉琮為青州刺史，便教起程。,"Liu Zong was highly delighted when his two chief supporters returned with the promise Cao Cao had given them. Soon after he gave up his seal and military commission and proceeded to welcome Cao Cao, who received him very graciously.Cao Cao next proceeded to camp near Xiangyang. The populace, led by Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, welcomed him with burning incense, and he on his part put forth proclamations couched in comforting terms.Cao Cao presently entered the city and took his seat in the residence in state. Then he summoned Kuai Yue and said to him graciously, ""I do not rejoice so much at gaining Jingzhou as at meeting you, friend Kuai Yue.""Cao Cao made Kuai Yue Governor of Jiangling and Lord of Fancheng; Wang Can, Fu Xuan, and Kuai Yue's other adherents were all ennobled. Liu Zong became Imperial Protector of Qingzhou in the north and was ordered to proceed to his region forthwith."
琮聞命大驚，辭曰：「琮不願為官，願守父母鄉土。」操曰：「青州近帝都，教你隨朝為官，免在荊襄被人圖害。」琮再三推辭，曹操不准。琮只得與母蔡夫人同赴青州。只有故將王威相隨，其餘官員俱送至江口而回。操喚于禁囑付曰：「你可引輕騎追劉琮母子殺之，以絕後患。」,"Liu Zong was greatly frightened and said, ""I have no wish to become an actual official. I wish to remain in the place where my father and mother live.""Said Cao Cao, ""Your protectorship is quite near the capital, and I have sent you there as a full official to remove you from the intrigues of this place.""In vain Liu Zong declined the honors thus thrust upon him: He was compelled to go and he departed, taking his mother with him. Of his friends, only Wang Wei accompanied him. Some of his late officers escorted him as far as the river and then took their leave.Then Cao Cao called his trusty officer Yu Jin and said, ""Follow Liu Zong and put him and his mother to death. Our worries are thus removed."""
于禁得令，領眾趕上，大喝曰：「我奉丞相令，教來殺汝母子！可早納下首級！」蔡夫人抱劉琮而大哭。于禁喝令軍士下手。王威忿怒，奮力相鬥，竟被眾軍所殺。軍士殺死劉琮及蔡夫人。于禁回報曹操，操重賞于禁，便使人往隆中搜尋孔明妻小，卻不知去向。原來孔明先已令人搬送至三江內隱避矣，操深恨之。,"Yu Jin followed the small party.When he drew near he shouted, ""I have an order from the great Prime Minister to put you both to death, mother and son! You may as well submit quietly.""Lady Cai threw her arms about her son, lifted up her voice and wept. Yu Jin bade his soldiers get on with their bloody work. Only Wang Wei made any attempt to save his mistress, and he was soon killed. The two, mother and son, were soon finished, and Yu Jin returned to report his success. He was richly rewarded.Next Cao Cao sent to discover and seize the family of Zhuge Liang, but they had already disappeared. Zhuge Liang had moved them to the Three Gorges. It was much to Cao Cao's disgust that the search was fruitless."
襄陽既定，荀攸進言曰：「江陵乃荊襄重地，錢糧極廣。劉備若據此地，急難動搖。」操曰：「孤豈忘之？」隨命於襄陽諸將中，選一員引軍開道。諸將中卻獨不見文聘。操使人尋問，方纔來見。操曰：「汝來何遲？」對曰：「為人臣而不能使其主保全境土，心實悲慚，無顏早見耳。」言訖，欷歔流涕。操曰：「真忠臣也！」除江夏太守，賜爵關內侯，便教引軍開道。探馬報說：「劉備帶領百姓，日行止十數里，計程只有三百餘里。」操教各部下精選五千鐵騎，星夜前進，限一日一夜，趕上劉備。大軍陸續隨後而進。,"So Xiangyang was settled. Then Xun You proposed a further advance.He said, ""Jiangling is an important place, and very rich. If Liu Bei gets it, it will be difficult to dislodge him.""""How could I have overlooked that?"" said Cao Cao.Then he called upon the officers of Xiangyang for one who could lead the way. They all came except Wen Ping.Cao Cao sent for him and soon he came also.""Why are you late?"" asked Cao Cao.Wen Ping said, ""To be a minister and see one's master lose his own boundaries is most shameful. Such a person has no face to show to anyone else, and I was too ashamed to come.""His tears fell fast as he finished this speech. Cao Cao admired his loyal conduct and rewarded him with office of Governorship of Jiangxia and a title of Lordship, and also bade him open the way.The spies returned and said, ""Liu Bei is hampered by the crowds of people who have followed him. He can proceed only three or four miles daily, and he is only one hundred miles away.""Cao Cao decided to take advantage of Liu Bei's plight, so he chose out five thousand of tried horsemen and sent them after the cavalcade, giving them a limit of a day and a night to come up therewith. The main army would follow."
卻說玄德引十數萬百姓、三千餘軍馬，一程程挨著往江陵進發。趙雲保護老小，張飛斷後。孔明曰：「雲長往江夏去了，絕無回音，不知若何。」玄德曰：「敢煩軍師親自走一遭，劉琦感公昔日之教，今若見公親至，事必諧矣。」孔明允諾，便同劉封引五百軍先往江夏求救去了。,"As has been said Liu Bei was traveling with a huge multitude of followers, to guard whom he had taken what precautions were possible. Zhang Fei was in charge of the rear guard, and Zhao Zilong was to protect his lord's family. Guan Yu had been sent to Jiangxia.One day Zhuge Liang came in and said, ""There is as yet no news from Jiangxia. There must be some difficulties.""""I wish that you yourself would go there,"" said Liu Bei. ""Liu Qi would remember your former kindness to him and consent to anything you proposed.""Zhuge Liang said he would go and set out with Liu Feng, the adopted son of Liu Bei, taking an escort of five hundred troops."
當日玄德自與簡雍、糜竺、糜芳同行。正行間，忽然一陣狂風在馬前刮起，塵土沖天，平遮紅日。玄德驚曰：「此何兆也？」簡雍頗明陰陽，袖占一課，失驚曰：「此大凶之兆也，應在今夜，主公可速棄百姓而走。」玄德曰：「百姓從新野相隨至此，吾安忍棄之？」雍日：「主公若戀而不棄，禍不遠矣。」玄德問：「前面是何處？」左右答曰：「前面是當陽縣。有座山名為景山。」玄德便教「就此山紮住」。,"A few days after, while on the march in company with three of his commanders —-Jian Yong, Mi Zhu, and Mi Fang —-a sudden whirlwind rose just in front of Liu Bei, and a huge column of dust shot up into the air hiding the face of the sun. Liu Bei was frightened and asked, ""What might that portend?""Jian Yong, who knew something of the mysteries of nature, took the auspices by counting secretly on his fingers.Pale and trembling, he announced, ""A calamity is threatening this very night. My lord must leave the people to their fate and flee quickly.""""I cannot do that,"" said Liu Bei.""If you allow your pity to overcome your judgment, then misfortune is very near,"" said Jian Yong.Thus spoke Jian Yong to his lord, who then asked what place was near.His people replied, ""Dangyang is quite close, and there is a very famous mountain near it called Prospect Mountain.""Then Liu Bei bade them lead the way thither."
時秋末冬初，涼風透骨；黃昏將近，哭聲遍野。至四更時分，只聽得西北喊聲震地而來。玄德大驚，急上馬引本部精兵二千餘人迎敵。曹兵掩至，勢不可當。玄德死戰。,"The season was late autumn, just changing to winter, and the icy wind penetrated to the very bones. As evening fell, long-drawn howls of misery were heard on every side. At the middle of the fourth watch, two hours after midnight, they heard a rumbling sound in the northwest. Liu Bei halted and placed himself at the head of his own guard of two thousand soldiers to meet whatever might come.Presently Cao Cao's men appeared and made fierce onslaught. Defense was impossible, though Liu Bei fought desperately."
正在危迫之際，幸得張飛引軍至，殺開一條血路，救玄德望東而走。文聘當先攔住。玄德罵曰：「背主之賊，尚有何面目見人！」文聘羞慚滿面，引兵自投東北去了。,"By good fortune just at the crisis Zhang Fei came up, cut an alley through, rescued his brother, and got him away to the east. Presently they were stopped by Wen Ping.""Turncoat! Can you still look humans in the face?"" cried Liu Bei.Wen Ping was overwhelmed with shame and led his troops away. Zhang Fei, now fighting, protected his brother till dawn."
張飛保著玄德，且戰且走。奔至天明，聞喊聲漸漸遠去，玄德方纔歇馬。看手下隨行人，止有百餘騎；百姓老小并糜竺、糜芳、簡雍、趙雲等一干人，皆不知下落。玄德大哭曰：「十數萬生靈，皆因戀我，遭此大難；諸將及老小，皆不知存亡，雖土木之人，寧不悲乎！」,"By that time Liu Bei had got beyond the sound of battle, and there was time to rest. Only a few of his followers had been able to keep near him. He knew nothing of the fate of his officers or the people.He lifted up his voice in lamentation, saying, ""Myriads of living souls are suffering from love of me, and my officers and my loved ones are lost. One would be a graven image not to weep at such loss!"""
正悽惶時，忽見糜芳面帶數箭，踉蹌而來，口言：「趙子龍反投曹操去了也！」玄德叱曰：「子龍是我故交，安肯反乎？」張飛曰：「他今見我等勢窮力盡，或者反投曹操，以圖富貴耳。」玄德曰：「子龍從我於患難，心如鐵石，非富貴所能動搖也。」糜芳曰：「我親見他投西北去了。」張飛曰：「待我親自尋他去，若撞見時，一槍刺死！」玄德曰：「休錯疑了。豈不見你二兄誅顏良、文醜之事乎？子龍此去，必有事故，我料子龍必不棄我也。」,"Still plunged in sadness, presently he saw hurrying toward him Mi Fang, with an enemy's arrow still sticking in his face.Mi Fang exclaimed, ""Zhao Zilong has gone over to Cao Cao!""Liu Bei angrily bade him be silent, crying, ""Do you think I can believe that of my old friend?""""Perhaps he has gone over,"" said Zhang Fei. ""He must see that we are nearly lost and there are riches and honors on the other side.""""He has followed me faithfully through all my misfortunes. His heart is firm as a rock. No riches or honors would move him,"" said Liu Bei.""I saw him go away northwest,"" said Mi Fang.""Wait till I meet him,"" said Zhang Fei. ""If I run against him, I will kill him!""""Beware how you doubt him,"" said Liu Bei. ""Have you forgotten the circumstances under which your brother Guan Yu had to slay Cai Yang to ease your doubts of him? Zhao Zilong's absence is due to good reason wherever he has gone, and he would never abandon me."""
張飛那裏肯聽，引二十餘騎，至長板橋。見橋東有一帶樹木，飛生一計，教所從二十餘騎，都砍下樹枝，拴在馬尾上，在樹林內往來馳騁，衝起塵土，以為疑兵。飛卻親自橫矛立馬於橋上，向西而望。,"But Zhang Fei was not convinced. Then he, with a score of his men, rode to the Long Slope Bridge. Seeing a wood near the bridge, an idea suddenly struck him. He bade his followers cut branches from the trees, tie them to the tails of the horses, and ride to and fro so as to raise a great dust as though an army were concealed in the wood. He himself took up his station on the bridge facing the west with spear set ready for action. So he kept watch."
卻說趙雲自四更時分，與曹軍廝殺，往來衝突，殺至天明，尋不見玄德，又失了玄德老小。雲自思曰：「主人將甘、糜二夫人，與小主人阿斗，託付在我身上；今日軍中失散，有何面目去見主人？不如去決一死戰，好歹要尋主母與小主人下落！」回顧左右，只有三四十騎相隨。雲拍馬在亂軍中尋覓，二縣百姓號哭之聲，震天動地。中箭著槍，拋男棄女而走者，不計其數。,"Now Zhao Zilong, after fighting with the enemy from the fourth watch till daylight, could see no sign of his lord and, moreover, had lost his lord's family.He thought bitterly within himself, ""My master confided to me his family and the child lord Liu Shan; and I have lost them. How can I look him in the face? I can only go now and fight to the death. Whatever happen, I must go to seek the women and my lord's son.""Turning about he found he had but some forty followers left. He rode quickly to and fro among the scattered soldiers seeking the lost women. The lamentations of the people about him were enough to make heaven and earth weep. Some had been wounded by arrows, others by spears; they had thrown away their children, abandoned their wives, and were flying they knew not whither in crowds."
趙雲正走之間，見一人臥在草中，視之乃簡雍也。雲急問曰：「曾見兩位主母否？」雍曰：「二主母棄了車仗，抱阿斗而走。我飛馬趕去，轉過山坡，被一將刺了一槍，跌下馬來，馬被奪了去。我爭鬥不得，故臥在此。」雲乃將從人所騎之馬，借一匹與簡雍騎坐；又著二卒扶護簡雍先去，報與主人：「我上天入地，好歹尋主母與小主人來。如尋不見，死在沙場上也！」,"Presently Zhao Zilong saw a man lying in the grass and recognized him as Jian Yong.""Have you seen the two mothers?"" cried he.Jian Yong replied, ""They left their carriage and ran away taking the child lord Liu Shan in their arms. I followed but on the slope of the hill I was wounded and fell from my horse. The horse was stolen. I could fight no longer, and I lay down here.""Zhao Zilong put his colleague on the horse of one of his followers, told off two soldiers to support Jian Yong, and bade Jian Yong ride to their lord and tell him of the loss.""Say,"" said Zhao Zilong, ""that I will seek the lost ones in heaven or hell, through good or evil. And if I find them not, I will die in the battlefield."""
說罷，拍馬望長板坡而去。忽一人大叫：「趙將軍那裏去？」雲勒馬問曰：「你是何人？」答曰：「我乃劉使君帳下護送車仗的軍士，被箭射倒在此。」趙雲便問二夫人消息。軍士曰：「恰纔見甘夫人披頭跣足，相隨一夥百姓婦女，投南而走。」,"Then Zhao Zilong rode off toward the Long Slope Bridge.As he went, a voice called out, ""General Zhao Zilong, where are you going?""""Who are you?"" said Zhao Zilong, pulling up.""One of the Princely One's carriage guards. I am wounded.""""Do you know anything of the two ladies?""""Not very long ago I saw Lady Gan go south with a party of other women. Her hair was down, and she was barefooted"""
雲見說，也不顧軍士，急縱馬望南趕去。只見一夥百姓，男女數百人，相攜而走。雲大叫曰：「內中有甘夫人否？」夫人在後面望見趙雲，放聲大哭。雲下馬插槍而泣曰：「使主母失散，雲之罪也！糜夫人與小主人安在？」甘夫人曰：「我與糜夫人被逐，棄了車仗，雜於百姓內步行，又撞見一枝軍馬衝散。糜夫人與阿斗不知何往。我獨自逃生至此。」,"Hearing this, without even another glance at the speaker, Zhao Zilong put his horse at full gallop toward the south. Soon he saw a small crowd of people, male and female, walking hand in hand.""Is Lady Gan among you!"" he called out.A woman in the rear of the party looked up at him and uttered a loud cry.He slipped off his steed, stuck his spear in the sand, and wept, ""It was my fault that you were lost. But where are Lady Mi and our child lord?""Lady Gan replied, ""She and I were forced to abandon our carriage and mingle with the crowd on foot. Then a band of soldiers came up, and we were separated. I do not know where they are. I ran for my life."""
正言間，百姓發喊，又撞出一枝軍來。趙雲拔槍上馬看時，面前馬上綁著一人，乃糜竺也。背後一將，手提大刀，引著千餘軍，乃曹仁部將淳于導，拿住糜竺，正要解去獻功。趙雲大喝一聲，挺槍縱馬，直取淳于導。導抵敵不住，被雲一槍刺落馬下，向前救了糜竺，奪得馬二匹。雲請甘夫人上馬，殺開條血路，直送至長板坡。只見張飛橫矛立馬於橋上，大叫：「子龍！你如何反我哥哥？」雲曰：「我尋不見主母與小主人，因此落後，何言反耶？」飛曰：「若非簡雍先來報信，我今見你，怎肯干休也！」雲曰：「主公在何處？」飛曰：「只在前面不遠。」雲謂糜竺曰：「糜子仲保甘夫人先行，待我仍往尋糜夫人與小主人去。」言罷，引數騎再回舊路。,"As she spoke, a howl of distress rose from the crowd of fugitives, for a thousand of soldiers appeared. Zhao Zilong recovered his spear and mounted ready for action. Presently he saw among the soldiers a prisoner bound upon a horse, and the prisoner was Mi Zhu. Behind Mi Zhu followed a general gripping a huge sword. The troops belonged to the army of Cao Ren, and the general was Chunyu Dao. Having captured Mi Zhu, he was just taking him to his chief as a proof of his prowess.Zhao Zilong shouted and rode at the captor who was speedily slain by a spear thrust and his captive was set free. Then taking two of the horses, Zhao Zilong set Lady Gan on one and Mi Zhu took the other. They rode away toward Long Slope Bridge.But there, standing grim on the bridge, was Zhang Fei.As soon as he saw Zhao Zilong, he called out, ""Zhao Zilong, why have you betrayed our lord?""""I fell behind because I was seeking the ladies and our child lord,"" said Zhao Zilong. ""What do you mean by talking of betrayal?""""If it had not been that Jian Yong arrived before you and told me the story, I should hardly have spared you.""""Where is the master?"" said Zhao Zilong.""Not far away, in front there,"" said Zhang Fei.""Conduct Lady Gan to him. I am going to look for Lady Mi,"" said Zhao Zilong to his companion, and he turned back along the road by which he had come."
正走之間，見一將手提鐵槍，背著一口劍，引十數騎躍馬而來。趙雲更不打話，直取那將。交馬只一合，把那將一槍刺倒，從騎皆走。原來那將乃曹操隨身背劍之將夏侯恩也。曹操有寶劍二口：一名「倚天」，一名「青釭」。倚天劍自佩之，青釭劍令夏侯恩佩之。那青釭劍砍鐵如泥，鋒利無比。,"Before long he met a leader armed with an iron spear and carrying a sword slung across his back, riding a curvetting steed, and leading ten other horsemen. Without uttering a word Zhao Zilong rode straight toward him and engaged. At the first pass Zhao Zilong disarmed his opponent and brought him to earth. His followers galloped away.This fallen officer was no other than Xiahou En, Cao Cao's sword-bearer. And the sword on Xiahou En's back was his master's. Cao Cao had two swords, one called ""Trust of God"" and the other ""Blue Blade"". Trust of God was the weapon Cao Cao usually wore at his side, the other being carried by his sword-bearer. The Blue Blade would cut clean through iron as though it were mud, and no sword had so keen an edge."
當時夏侯恩自恃勇力，背著那劍，只顧引人搶奪擄掠。不想撞著趙雲，被他一槍刺死，奪了那口劍，看靶上有金嵌「青釭」二字，方知是寶劍也。雲插劍提槍，復殺入重圍；回顧手下從騎，已沒一人，只剩得孤身。雲並無半點退心，只顧往來尋覓。但逢百姓，便問糜夫人消息。忽一人指曰：「夫人抱著孩兒，左腿上著了槍，行走不得，只在前面牆缺內坐地。」,"Before Zhao Zilong thus fell in with Xiahou En, the latter was simply plundering, depending upon the authority implied by his office. Least of all thought he of such sudden death as met he at Zhao Zilong's hands.So Zhao Zilong got possession of a famous sword. The name Blue Blade was chased in gold characters so that he recognized its value at once. He stuck it in his belt and again plunged into the press. Just as he did so, he turned his head and saw he had not a single follower left. He was quite alone.Nevertheless not for a single instant thought he of turning back. He was too intent upon his quest. To and fro, back and forth, he rode questioning this person and that.At length a man said, ""A woman with a child in her arms, and wounded in the thigh so that she cannot walk, is lying over there through that hole in the wall."""
趙雲聽了，連忙追尋。只見一個人家，被火燒壞土牆，糜夫人抱著阿斗，坐於牆下枯井之傍啼哭。雲急下馬伏地而拜。夫人曰：「妾得見將軍，阿斗有命矣。望將軍可憐他父親飄蕩半世，只有這點骨血。將軍可護持此子，教他得見父面，妾死無恨！」,"Zhao Zilong rode to look and there, beside an old well behind the broken wall of a burned house, sat the mother clasping the child to her breast and weeping. Zhao Zilong was on his knees before her in a moment.""My child will live then since you are here,"" cried Lady Mi. ""Pity him, O General! Protect him, for he is the only son of his father's flesh and blood. Take him to his father, and I can die content."""
雲曰：「夫人受難，雲之罪也。不必多言，請夫人上馬。雲自步行死戰，保夫人透出重圍。」糜夫人曰：「不可。將軍豈可無馬？此子全賴將軍保護。妾已重傷，死何足惜！望將軍速抱此子前去，勿以妾為累也。」雲曰：「喊聲將近，追兵已至，請夫人速速上馬。」糜夫人曰：「妾身委實難去，休得兩誤。」乃將阿斗遞與趙雲曰：「此子性命全在將軍身上！」,"""It is my fault that you have suffered,"" replied Zhao Zilong. ""But it is useless to say more. I pray you take my horse, while I will walk beside and protect you till we get clear.""She replied, ""I may not do that. What would you do without a steed? But the boy here I confide to your care. I am badly wounded and cannot hope to live. Pray take him and go your way. Do not trouble more about me.""""I hear shouting,"" said Zhao Zilong. ""The soldiers will be upon us again in a moment. Pray mount quickly!""""But really I cannot move,"" she said. ""Do not let there be a double loss!""And she held out the child toward him as she spoke.""Take the child!"" cried Lady Mi. ""His life and safety are in your hands."""
趙雲三回五次，請夫人上馬，夫人只不肯上馬。四邊喊聲又起。雲厲聲曰：「夫人不聽吾言，追軍若至，為之奈何？」糜夫人乃棄阿斗於地，翻身投入枯井中而死。後人有詩讚之曰：,"Again and again Zhao Zilong besought her to get on his horse, but she would not.The shouting drew nearer and nearer, Zhao Zilong spoke harshly, saying, ""If you will not do what I say, what will happen when the soldiers come up?""She said no more. Throwing the child on the ground, she turned over and threw herself into the old well. And there she perished."
戰將全憑馬力多，步行怎把幼君扶？拚將一死存劉嗣，勇決還虧女丈夫。,"The warrior relies upon the strength of his charger,Afoot, how could he bear to safety his young prince?Brave mother! Who died to preserve the son of her husband's line;Heroine was she, bold and decisive!"
趙雲見夫人已死，恐曹軍盜屍，便將土牆推倒，掩蓋枯井。掩訖，解開勒甲縧，放下掩心鏡，將阿斗抱護在懷，綽槍上馬。早有一將，引一隊步軍至，乃曹洪部將晏明也，持三尖兩刃刀來戰趙雲。不三合，被趙雲一槍刺倒，殺散眾軍，衝開一條路。,"Seeing that Lady Mi had resolved the question by dying, there was nothing more to be done. Zhao Zilong pushed over the wall to fill the well, and thus making a grave for the lady. Then he loosened his armor, let down the heart-protecting mirror, and placed the child in his breast. This done he slung his spear and remounted.Zhao Zilong had gone but a short distance, when he saw a horde of enemy led by Yan Ming, one of Cao Hong's generals. This warrior used a double edged, three pointed weapon and he offered battle. However, Zhao Zilong disposed of him after a very few bouts and dispersed his troops."
正走間，前面又一枝軍馬攔路。當先一員大將，旗號分明，大書「河間張郃」。雲更不答話，挺槍便戰。約十餘合，雲不敢戀戰，奪路而走。背後張郃追來，雲加鞭而行，不想趷躂一聲，連馬和人，顛入土坑之內。張郃挺槍來刺，忽然一道紅光，從土坑中衝起：那匹馬平空一躍，跳出坑外。後人有詩曰：,"As the road cleared before him, Zhao Zilong saw another detachment barring his way. At the head of this was a general exalted enough to display a banner with his name Zhang He of Hejian. Zhao Zilong never waited to parley but attacked. However, this was a more formidable antagonist, and half a score bouts found neither any nearer defeat. But Zhao Zilong, with the child in his bosom, could only fight with the greatest caution, and so he decided to flee.Zhang He pursued, and as Zhao Zilong thought only of thrashing his steed to get away, and little of the road, suddenly he went crashing into a pit. On came his pursuer, spear at poise. Suddenly a brilliant flash of light seemed to shoot out of the pit, and the fallen horse leapt with it into the air and was again on firm earth."
紅光罩體困龍飛，征馬衝開長板圍。四十二年真命主，將軍因得顯神威。,"A bright glory surrounds the child of the imperial line, now in danger,The powerful charger forces his way through the press of battle,Bearing to safety him who was destined to the throne two score years and two;And the general thus manifested his godlike courage."
張郃見了，大驚而退。趙雲縱馬正走，背後忽有二將大叫：「趙雲休走！」前面又有二將，使兩般軍器，截住去路：後面趕的是馬延、張顗，前面阻的是焦觸、張南，都是袁紹手下降將。趙雲力戰四將，曹軍一齊擁至。雲乃拔青釭劍亂砍。手起處，衣甲透過，血如湧泉。殺退眾軍將，直透重圍。,"This apparition frightened Zhang He, who abandoned the pursuit forthwith, and Zhao Zilong rode off.Presently he heard shouts behind, ""Zhao Zilong, Zhao Zilong, stop!"" and at the same time he saw ahead of him two generals who seemed disposed to dispute his way.Ma Yan and Zhang Zi following and Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng in front, his state seemed desperate, but Zhao Zilong quailed not.As the men of Cao Cao came pressing on, Zhao Zilong drew Cao Cao's own sword to beat them off. Nothing could resist the blue blade sword. Armor, clothing, it went through without effort and blood gushed forth in fountains wherever it struck. So the four generals were soon beaten off, and Zhao Zilong was once again free."
卻說曹操在景山頂上，望見一將，所到之處，威不可當，急問左右是誰。曹洪飛馬下山大叫曰：「軍中戰將可留姓名！」雲應聲曰：「吾乃常山趙子龍也！」曹洪回報曹操。操曰：「真虎將也！吾當生致之。」遂令飛馬傳報各處：「如趙雲到，不許放冷箭，只要捉活的。」因此趙雲得脫此難。此亦阿斗之福所致也。,"Now Cao Cao from a hilltop of the Prospect Mountain saw these deeds of derring-do and a general showing such valor that none could withstand him, so Cao Cao asked of his followers whether any knew the man. No one recognized him. So Cao Hong galloped down into the plain and shouted out, ""We should hear the name of the warrior!""""I am Zhao Zilong of Changshan!"" replied Zhao Zilong.Cao Hong returned and told his lord, who said, ""A very tiger of a leader! I must get him alive.""Whereupon he sent horsemen to all detachments with orders that no arrows were to be fired from an ambush at any point Zhao Zilong should pass: He was to be taken alive."
這一場殺，趙雲懷抱後主，直透重圍，砍倒大旗兩面，奪槊三條；前後槍刺劍砍，殺死曹營名將五十餘員。後人有詩曰：,"And so Zhao Zilong escaped most imminent danger, and Liu Shan's safety, bound up with his savior's, was also secured. On this career of slaughter which ended in safety, Zhao Zilong, bearing in his bosom the child lord Liu Shan, cut down two main banners, took three spears, and slew or wounded of Cao Cao's generals half a hundred, all men of renown."
血染征袍透甲紅，當陽誰敢與爭鋒！古來衝陣扶危主，只有常山趙子龍。,"Blood dyed the fighting robe and crimsoned his buff coat;None dared engage the terrible warrior at Dangyang;In the days of old lived the brave Zhao Zilong,Who fought in the battlefield for his lord in danger."
趙雲當下殺透重圍，已離大陣，血滿征袍。正行間，山坡下又撞出兩枝軍，乃夏侯惇部將鍾縉、鍾紳兄弟二人，一個使大斧，一個使畫戟，大喝：「趙雲快下馬受縛！」正是：纔離虎窟逃生去，又遇龍潭鼓浪來。畢竟子龍怎地脫身，且聽下文分解。,"Having thus fought his way out of the press, Zhao Zilong lost no time in getting away from the battle field. His white battle robe had turned red, soaking in blood.On his way, near the rise of the hills, he met with two other bodies of troops under two brothers, Zhong Jin and Zhong Shen. One of these was armed with a massive ax, the other a halberd.As soon as they saw Zhao Zilong, they knew him and shouted, ""Quickly dismount and be bound!""He has only escaped from the tiger cave,To risk the dragon pool's sounding wave. How Zhao Zilong escaped will be next related."
