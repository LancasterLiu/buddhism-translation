卻說魯肅領了周瑜言語，逕來舟中相探孔明，孔明接入小舟對坐。肅曰：「連日措辦軍務，有失聽教。」孔明曰：「便是亮亦未與都督賀喜。」肅曰：「何喜？」孔明曰：「公瑾使先生來探亮知也不知，便是這件事可賀喜耳。」諕得魯肅失色問曰：「先生何由知之？」孔明曰：「這條計只好弄蔣幹。曹操雖被一時瞞過，必然便省悟，只是不肯認錯耳。今蔡、張兩人既死，江東無患矣，如何不賀喜？吾聞曹操換毛玠，于禁為水軍都督，在這兩個手裏，好歹送了水軍性命。」,"Lu Su departed on his mission and found Zhuge Liang seated in his little craft.""There has been so much to do that I have not been able to come to listen to your instructions,"" said Lu Su.""That is truly so,"" said Zhuge Liang, ""and I have not yet congratulated the Commander-in-Chief.""""What have you wished to congratulate him upon?""""Why Sir, the matter upon which he sent you to find out whether I knew about it or not. Indeed I can congratulate him on that.""Lu Su turned pale and gasped, saying, ""But how did you know, Master?""""The ruse succeeded well thus played off on Jiang Gan. Cao Cao has been taken in this once, but he will soon rise to it. Only he will not confess his mistake. However, the two men are gone, and the South Land is freed from a grave anxiety. Do you not think that is a matter for congratulation? I hear Mao Jie and Yu Jin are the new admirals, and in their hands lie both good and evil for the fate of the northern fleet."""
魯肅聽了，開口不得，把些言語支吾了半晌，別孔明而回。孔明囑曰：「望子敬在公瑾面前勿言亮先知此事。恐公瑾心懷妒忌，又要尋事害亮。」魯肅應諾而去，回見周瑜，把上項事只得實說了。瑜大驚曰：「此人決不可留！吾決意斬之！」肅勸曰：「若殺孔明，卻被曹操笑也。」瑜曰：「吾自有公道斬之，教他死而無怨。」肅曰：「以何公道斬之？」瑜曰：「子敬休問，來日便見。」,"Lu Su was quite dumbfounded. He stayed a little time longer passing the time in making empty remarks, and then took his leave.As he was going away, Zhuge Liang cautioned him, saying, ""Do not let Zhou Yu know that I know his ruse. If you let him know, he will seek some chance to do me harm.""Lu Su promised. Nevertheless he went straight to his chief and related the whole thing just as it happened.""Really he must be got rid of,"" said Zhou Yu.""I have quite decided to put the man out of the way.""""If you slay him, will not Cao Cao laugh at you?""""Oh, no! I will find a legitimate way of getting rid of him so that he shall go to his death without resentment.""""But how can you find a legitimate way of assassinating him?""""Do not ask too much. You will see presently."""
次日，聚眾將於帳下，教請孔明議事。孔明欣然而至。坐定，瑜問孔明曰：「即日將與曹軍交戰，水路交兵，當以何兵器為先？」孔明曰：「大江之上，以弓箭為先。」瑜曰：「先生之言，甚合吾意。但今軍中正缺箭用，敢煩先生監造十萬枝箭，以為應敵之具。此係公事，先生幸勿推卻。」孔明曰：「都督見委，自當效勞。敢問十萬枝箭，何時要用？」瑜曰：「十日之內，可辦完否？」孔明曰：「操軍即日將至，若候十日，必誤大事。」瑜曰：「先生料幾日可辦完？」孔明曰：「只消三日，便可拜納十萬枝箭。」瑜曰：「軍中無戲言。」孔明曰：「怎敢戲都督！願納軍令狀：三日不辦，甘當重罰。」,"Soon after all the officers were summoned to the main tent, and Zhuge Liang's presence was desired. He went contentedly enough.When all were seated, Zhou Yu suddenly addressed Zhuge Liang, saying, ""I am going to fight a battle with the enemy soon on the water. What weapons are the best?""""On a great river arrows are the best,"" said Zhuge Liang.""Your opinion and mine agree. But at the moment we are short of them. I wish you would undertake to supply about a hundred thousand arrows for the naval fight. As it is for the public service, you will not decline, I hope.""""Whatever task the Commander-in-Chief lays upon me, I must certainly try to perform,"" replied Zhuge Liang. ""May I inquire by what date you require the hundred thousand arrows?""""Could you have them ready in ten days?""""The enemy will be here very soon. Ten days will be too late,"" said Zhuge Liang.""In how many days do you estimate the arrows can be ready?""""Let me have three days. Then you may send for your hundred thousand.""""No joking, remember!"" said Zhou Yu. ""There is no joking in war time.""""Dare I joke with the Commander-in-Chief? Give me a formal military order. If I have not completed the task in three days, I will take my punishment."""
瑜大喜，喚軍政司當面取了文書，置酒相待曰：「待軍事畢後，自有酬勞。」孔明曰：「今日已不及，來日造起。至第三日，可差五百小軍到江邊搬箭。」飲了數杯，辭去。魯肅曰：「此人莫非詐乎？」瑜曰：「他自送死，非我逼他。今明白對眾要了文書，他便兩脅生翅，也飛不去。我只分付軍匠人等，教他故意遲延，凡應用物件，都不與齊備。如此，必然誤了日期。那時定罪，有何理說？公今可去探他虛實，卻來回報。」,"Zhou Yu, secretly delighted, sent for the secretaries and prepared the commission then and there.Then he drank to the success of the undertaking and said, ""I shall have to congratulate you most heartily when this is accomplished.""""This day is too late to count,"" said Zhuge Liang. ""On the third from tomorrow morning send five hundred soldiers to the river side to convey the arrows.""They drank a few more cups together, and then Zhuge Liang took his leave.After he had gone, Lu Su said, ""Do you not think there is some deceit about this?""""Clearly it is not I! It is he who has signed his own death warrant,"" said Zhou Yu. ""Without being pressed in the least, he asked for a formal order in the face of the whole assembly. Even if he grew a pair of wings, he could not escape. Only I will just order the workers to delay him as much as they can, and not supply him with materials, so that he is sure to fail. And then, when the certain penalty is incurred, who can criticize? You can go and inquire about it all and keep me informed."""
肅領命來見孔明。孔明曰：「吾曾告子敬，休對公瑾說，他必要害我。不想子敬不肯為我隱諱，今日果然又弄出事來。三日內如何造得十萬箭？子敬只得救我！」肅曰：「公自取其禍，我如何救得你？」孔明曰：「望子敬借我二十隻船，每船要軍士三十人，船上皆用青布為幔，各束草千餘個，分布兩邊。吾自有妙用。第三日包管有十萬枝箭。只不可又教公瑾得知；若彼知之，吾計敗矣。」,"So off went Lu Su to seek Zhuge Liang, who at once reproached him with having blabbed about the former business.Zhuge Liang said, ""He wants to hurt me, as you know, and I did not think you could not keep my secret. And now there is what you saw today, and how do you think I can get a hundred thousand arrows made in three days? You will simply have to rescue me.""""You brought the misfortune on yourself, and how can I rescue you?"" said Lu Su.""I look to you for the loan of twenty vessels, manned each by thirty people. I want blue cotton screens and bundles of straw lashed to the sides of the boats. I have good use for them. On the third day, I shall undertake to deliver the fixed number of arrows. But on no account must you let Zhou Yu know, or my scheme will be wrecked."""
肅應諾，卻不解其意，回報周瑜，果然不提起借船之事；只言孔明並不用箭竹翎毛膠漆等物，自有道理。瑜大疑曰：「且看他三日後如何回覆我！」,"Lu Su consented, and this time he kept his word. He went to report to his chief as usual, but he said nothing about the boats.He only said, ""Zhuge Liang is not using bamboo or feathers or glue or varnish, but has some other way of getting arrows.""""Let us await the three days' limit,"" said Zhou Yu, puzzled though confident."
卻說魯肅私自撥輕快船二十隻，各船三十餘人，並布幔束草等物，盡皆齊備，候孔明調用。第一日卻不見孔明動靜；第二日亦只不動。至第三日四更時分，孔明密請魯肅到船中。肅問曰：「公召我來何意？」孔明曰：「特請子敬同往取箭。」肅曰：「何處去取？」孔明曰：「子敬休問，前去便見。」遂命將二十隻船，用長索相連，逕望北岸進發。是夜大霧漫天，長江之中，霧氣更甚，對面不相見。孔明促舟前進，果然是好大霧！前人有篇大霧垂江賦曰：大哉長江，西接岷峨，南控三吳，北帶九河。匯百川而入海，歷萬古以揚波。至若龍伯，海若，江妃，水母，長鯨千丈，天蜈九首，鬼怪異類，咸集而有。蓋夫鬼神之所憑依，英雄之所戰守也。時而陰陽既亂，昧爽不分。訝長空之一色，忽大霧之四屯。雖輿薪而莫睹，惟金鼓之可聞。初若溟濛，纔隱南山之豹；漸而充塞，欲迷北海之鯤。然後上接高天，下垂厚地。渺乎蒼茫，浩乎無際。鯨鯢出水而騰波，蛟龍潛淵而吐氣。又如梅霖收溽，春陰釀寒；溟溟濛濛，浩浩漫漫。東失柴桑之岸，南無夏口之山。戢船千艘，俱沈淪於巖壑；漁舟一葉，驚出沒於波瀾。甚則穹昊無光，朝陽失色；返白晝為昏黃，變丹山為水碧。雖大禹之智，不能測其淺深；離婁之明，焉能辨乎咫尺？於是馮夷息浪，屏翳收功；魚鱉遁跡，鳥獸潛蹤。隔斷蓬萊之島，暗圍閶闔之官。恍惚奔騰，如驟雨之將至；紛紜雜沓，若寒雲之欲同。乃復中隱毒蛇，因之而為瘴癘；內藏妖魅，憑之而為禍害。降疾厄於人間，起風塵於塞外。小民遇之失傷，大人觀之感慨。蓋將返元氣於洪荒，混天地為大塊。,"On his side Lu Su quietly prepared a score of light swift boats, each with its crew and the blue screens and bundles of grass complete and, when these were ready, he placed them at Zhuge Liang's disposal. Zhuge Liang did nothing on the first day, nor on the second. On the third day at the middle of the fourth watch, Zhuge Liang sent a private message asking Lu Su to come to his boat.""Why have you sent for me, Sir?"" asked Lu Su.""I want you to go with me to get those arrows.""""Whither are you going?""""Do not ask. You will see.""Then the twenty boats were fastened together by long ropes and moved over to the north bank. The night proved very foggy and the mist was very dense along the river, so that one person could scarcely see another. In spite of the fog, Zhuge Liang urged the boats forward as if into the vast fairy kingdom.There is a poem on these river fogs:Mighty indeed is the Great River!Rising far in the west, in the Emei and Min Mountains,Plowing its way through Wu, east flowing, resistless,Swelled by its nine tributary streams, rolling down from the far north,Aided and helped by a hundred rivulets swirling and foaming,Ocean receives it at last welcoming, joyful, its waters.Therein abide sea nymphs and water gods,Enormous whales a thousand fathoms long,Nine-headed monstrous beasts, reptiles and octopi,Demons and uncouth creatures wondrous strange.In faith it is the home and safe retreatOf devils and sprites, and wondrous growths,And eke the battle ground of valiant humans.At times occur strange strife of elements,When darkness strives on light's domains that encroach,Whereat arises in the vaulted dome of blueWhite wreaths of fog that toward the center roll.Then darkness falls, too dense for any torchIllumine; only clanging sounds can pass.The fog at first appears, a vaporous wreathScarce visible. But thickening fast, it veilsThe Southern Hills, the painted leopard's home.And spreads afar, until the northern seaLeviathans are amazed and lose their course.And denser yet it touches on the sky.And spreads a heavy mantle over the earth.Then, wide as is the high pitched arch of heaven,Therein appears no single rift of blue.Now mighty whales lead up their spouses to sportUpon the waves, the sinuous dragons diveDeep down and, breathing, swell the heaving sea,The earth is moist as with the early rains,And spring's creative energy is chilled.Both far and wide and high the damp fog spreads,Great cities on the eastern bank are hid,Wide ports and mountains in the south are lost,Whole fleets of battle ships, a thousand keels,Hide in the misty depths; frail fishing boatsHigh riding on a wave are seen —-and lost.The gloom increases and the domed skyGrows dark and darker as the sun's light fails.The daylight dies, dim twilight's reign begins,The ruddy hills dissolve and lose their hue.The skill of matchless King Yu would fail to soundThe depth and height; and Li Lou's eye, though keen,Could never pierce this gloom.Now is the time, O sea and river gods, to use your powers.The gliding fish and creeping water folkAre lost; there is no track for bird or beast.Fair Penglai Isles are hidden from our sight,The lofty gates of heaven have disappeared.Nature is blurred and indistinct, as whenA driving rain storm hurries over the earth.And then, perhaps, within the heavy haze,A noisome serpent vents his venom foulAnd plagues descend, or impish demons workTheir wicked wills.Ills fall on humans but do not stay,Heaven's cleansing breath sweeps them sway,But while they last the mean ones cry,The nobler suffer silently.The greatest turmoil is a signOf quick return to state benign."
當夜五更時候，船已近曹操水寨。孔明教把船隻頭西尾東，一帶擺開，就船上擂鼓吶喊。魯肅驚曰：「倘曹兵齊出，如之奈何？」孔明笑曰：「吾料曹操於重霧中必不敢出。吾等只顧酌酒取樂，待霧散便回。」,"The little fleet reached Cao Cao's naval camp about the fifth watch, and Zhuge Liang gave orders to form line lying prows west, and then to beat the drums and shout.""But what shall we do if they attack us?"" exclaimed Lu Su.Zhuge Liang replied with a smile, ""I think their fleet will not venture out in this fog. Go on with your wine, and let us be happy. We will go back when the fog lifts."""
卻說曹操寨中，聽得擂鼓吶喊，毛玠，于禁，二人慌忙飛報曹操。操傳令曰：「重霧迷江，彼軍忽至，必有埋伏，切不可輕動。可撥水軍弓弩手亂射之。」又差人往旱寨內喚張遼，徐晃，各帶弓弩軍三千，火速到江邊助射。比及號令到來，毛玠，于禁，怕南軍搶入水寨，已差弓弩手在寨前放箭。,"As soon as the shouting from the river was heard by those in the camp, the two admirals, Mao Jie and Yu Jin, ran off to report to Cao Cao, who said, ""Coming up in a fog like this means that they have prepared an ambush for us. Do not go out, but get all the force together and shoot at them.""He also sent orders to the ground camps to dispatch six thousand of archers and crossbowmen to aid the marines.The naval forces were then lined up shooting on the bank to prevent a landing."
少頃，旱寨內弓弩手亦到，約一萬餘人，盡皆向江中放箭：箭如雨發。孔明教把船掉轉，頭東尾西，逼近水寨受箭，一面擂鼓吶喊。待至日高霧散，孔明令收船急回。二十隻船兩邊束草上，排滿箭枝。孔明令各船上軍士齊聲叫曰：「謝丞相箭！」比及曹軍寨內報知曹操時，這裏船輕水急，已放回二十餘里，追之不及，曹操懊悔不已。,"Presently the soldiers arrived, and ten thousand and more soldiers were shooting down into the river, where the arrows fell like rain. By and bye Zhuge Liang ordered the boats to turn round so that their prows pointed east and to go closer in so that many arrows might hit them.Zhuge Liang ordered the drums to be kept beating till the sun was high and the fog began to disperse, when the boats got under way and sailed down stream. The whole twenty boats were bristling with arrows on both sides.As they left, Zhuge Liang asked all the crews to shout derisively, ""We thank you, Sir Prime Minister, for the arrows!""They told Cao Cao, but by the time he came, the light boats helped by the swift current were seven miles long down the river and pursuit was impossible. Cao Cao saw that he had been duped and was very sorry, but there was no help for it."
卻說孔明回船謂魯肅曰：「每船上箭約五六千矣。不費江東半分之力，已得十萬餘箭。明日即將來射曹軍，卻不甚便？」肅曰：「先生真神人也！何以知今日如此大霧？」孔明曰：「為將而不通天文，不識地利，不知奇門，不曉陰陽，不看陣圖，不明兵勢，是庸才也。亮於三日前已算定今日有大霧，因此敢任三日之限。公瑾教我十日完辦，工匠料物，都不應手，將這一件風流罪過，明白要殺我；我命繫於天，公瑾焉能害我哉！」,"On the way down Zhuge Liang said to his companion, ""Every boat must have five or six thousand arrows and so, without the expenditure of an ounce of energy, we must have more than ten myriad arrows, which tomorrow can be shot back again at Cao Cao's army to his great inconvenience.""""You are really superhuman,"" said Lu Su.""But how did you know there would be a thick fog today?""""One cannot be a leader without knowing the workings of heaven and the ways of earth. One must understand the secret gates and the interdependence of the elements, the mysteries of tactics and the value of forces. It is but an ordinary talent. I calculated three days ago that there would be a fog today, and so I set the limit at three days. Zhou Yu would give me ten days, but neither artificers nor materials, so that he might find occasion to put me to death as I knew. But my fate lies with the Supreme, and how could Zhou Yu harm me?"""
魯肅拜服。船到岸時，周瑜已差五百軍在江邊等候搬箭。孔明教於船上取之，可得十餘萬枝。都搬入中軍帳交納。魯肅入見周瑜，備說孔明取箭之事。瑜大驚，慨然歎曰：「孔明神機妙算，吾不如也！」後人有詩讚曰：,"Lu Su could not but agree. When the boats arrived, five hundred soldiers were in readiness on the bank to carry away the arrows. Zhuge Liang bade them go on board the boats, collect them and bear them to the tent of the Commander-in-Chief. Lu Su went to report that the arrows had been obtained and told Zhou Yu by what means.Zhou Yu was amazed and sighed sadly, saying, ""He is better than I. His methods are more than human."""
一天濃霧滿長江，遠近難分水渺茫。驟雨飛蝗來戰艦，孔明今日服周郎。,"Thick lies the fog on the river,Nature is shrouded in white,Distant and near are confounded,Banks are no longer in sight.Fast fly the pattering arrows,Stick in the boats of the fleet.Now can full tale be delivered,Zhuge Liang is victor complete."
少頃，孔明入寨見周瑜。瑜下帳迎之，稱羨曰：「先生神算，使人敬服。」孔明曰：「詭譎小計，何足為奇？」瑜邀孔明入帳共飲。瑜曰：「昨吾主遣使來催督進軍，瑜未有奇計，願先生教我。」孔明曰：「亮乃碌碌庸才，安有妙計？」瑜曰：「某昨觀曹操水寨，極其嚴整有法，非等閒可攻。思得一計，不知可否，先生幸為我一決之。」孔明曰：「都督且休言。各自寫於手內，看同也不同。」,"When, shortly after his return, Zhuge Liang went to the tent of the Commander-in-Chief, he was welcomed by Zhou Yu, who came forward to greet him, saying, ""Your superhuman predictions compel one's esteem.""""There is nothing remarkable in that trifling trick,"" replied he.Zhou Yu led him within and wine was brought.Then Zhou Yu said, ""My lord sent yesterday to urge me to advance, but I have no master plan ready. I wish you would assist me, Master.""""But where should I, a man of poor everyday ability, find such a plan as you desire?""""I saw the enemy's naval camp just lately, and it looked very complete and well organized. It is not an ordinary place to attack. I have thought of a plan, but I am not sure it will answer. I should be happy if you would decide for me.""""General,"" replied Zhuge Liang, ""do not say what your plan is, but each of us will write in the palm of his hand and see whether our opinions agree."""
瑜大喜，教取筆硯來，先自暗寫了，卻送與孔明。孔明亦暗寫了，兩個移近坐榻，各出掌中之字，互相觀看，皆大笑。原來周瑜掌中字，乃一『火』字，孔明掌中，亦一『火』字。瑜曰：「既我兩人所見相同，更無疑矣。幸勿漏泄。」孔明曰：「兩家公事，豈有漏泄之理？吾料曹操雖兩番經我這條計，然必不為備。今都督儘行之可也。」飲罷分散，諸將皆不知其事。,"So brush and ink were sent for, and Zhou Yu first wrote on his own palm, and then passed the pen to Zhuge Liang who also wrote. Then getting close together on the same bench, each showed his hand to the other, and both burst out laughing, for both had written the same word, ""Fire.""""Since we are of the same opinion,"" said Zhou Yu, ""there is no longer any doubt. But our intentions must be kept secret.""""Both of us are public servants, and what would be the sense of telling our plans? I do not think Cao Cao will be on his guard against this, although he has had two experiences. You may put your scheme into force.""They finished their wine and separated. Not an officer knew a word of their plans."
卻說曹操平白折了十五六萬箭，心中氣悶。荀攸進計曰：「江東有周瑜、諸葛亮二人用計，急切難破；可差人去東吳詐降，為奸細內應，以通消息，方可圖也。」操曰：「此言正合吾意。汝料軍中誰可行此計？」攸曰：「蔡瑁被誅，蔡氏宗族，皆在軍中。瑁之族弟蔡中，蔡和，現為副將。丞相可以恩結之，差往詐降，東吳必不見疑。」,"Now Cao Cao had expended a myriad arrows in vain and was much irritated in consequence. He deeply desired revenge.Then Xun You proposed a ruse, saying, ""The two strategists on the side of the enemy are Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang, two men most difficult to get the better of. Let us send someone who shall pretend to surrender to them but really be a spy on our behalf and a helper in our schemes. When we know what is doing, we can plan to meet it.""""I had thought of that myself,"" replied Cao Cao. ""Whom do you think the best person to send?""""Cai Mao has been put to death, but all his clan and family are in the army, and his two younger brothers are junior generals. You have them most securely in your power and may send them to surrender. The ruler of the South Land will never suspect deceit there."""
操從之，當夜密喚二人入帳囑付曰：「汝二人可引些少軍士，去東吳詐降。但有動靜，使人密報。事成之後，重加封賞。休懷二心！」二人曰：「吾等妻子俱在荊州，安敢懷二心，丞相勿疑。某二人必取周瑜，諸葛亮之首，獻於麾下。」操厚賞之。次日，二人帶五百軍士，駕船數隻，順風望著南岸來。,"Cao Cao decided to act on this plan, and in the evening summoned Cai Zhong and Cai He to his tent, where he told them, saying, ""I want you to pretend to surrender to the South Land so that you can gather intelligence and sent it back. When all done, you will be richly rewarded. But do not betray me.""""Our families are in Jingzhou, and that place is yours,"" replied they. ""Should we dare betray? You need have no doubts, Sir. You will soon see the heads of both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang at your feet.""Cao Cao gave them generous gifts. Soon after the two men, each with his five hundred soldiers, set sail with a fair wind for the opposite bank."
且說周瑜正理會進兵之事，忽報江北有船來到江口，稱是蔡瑁之弟蔡和，蔡中，特來投降，瑜喚入。二人哭拜曰：「吾兄無罪，被曹賊所殺。吾二人欲報兄仇，特來投降。望賜收錄，願為前部。」,"Now as Zhou Yu was preparing for the attack, the arrival of some northern ships was announced. They bore the two younger brothers of Cai Mao, who had come as deserters.They were led in and, bowing before the general, said, weeping, ""Our innocent brother has been put to death, and we desire vengeance. So we have come to offer allegiance to you. We pray you appoint us to the vanguard."""
瑜大喜，重賞二人，即命與甘寧引軍為前部。二人拜謝，以為中計。瑜密喚甘寧分付曰：「此二人不帶家小，非真投降，乃曹操使來為奸細者。吾今欲將計就計，教他通報消息。汝可慇懃相待，就裏隄防。至出兵之日，先要殺他兩個祭旗。汝切須小心，不可有誤。」,"Zhou Yu appeared very pleased and made them presents. Then he ordered them to join Gan Ning in leading the van. They thanked him and regarded their scheme as already a success.But Zhou Yu gave Gan Ning secret orders, saying, ""They have come without their families, and so I know their desertion is only pretense. They have been sent as spies, and I am going to meet their ruse with one of my own. They shall have some information to send. You will treat them well, but keep a careful guard over them. On the day our soldiers start the offense, they shall be sacrificed to the flag. But be very careful that nothing goes wrong."""
甘寧領命而去。魯肅入見周瑜曰：「蔡中，蔡和之降，多應是詐，不可收用。」瑜叱曰：「彼因曹操殺其兄，欲報仇而來降，何詐之有？你若如此多疑，安能容天下之士乎？」,"Gan Ning went away.Then Lu Su came to tell Zhou Yu, saying, ""Everyone agrees in thinking the surrender of Cai Zhong and Cai He feigned and they should be rejected.""""But they wish to revenge the death of their brother,"" said the Fleet Admiral. ""Where is the pretense? If you are so suspicious, you will receive nobody at all."""
肅默然而退，乃往告孔明，孔明笑而不言。肅曰：「孔明何故哂笑？」孔明曰：「吾笑子敬不識公瑾用計耳。大江隔遠，細作極難往來。操使蔡中，蔡和詐降，竊探我軍中事，公瑾將計就計，正要他通報消息。兵不厭詐，公瑾之謀是也。」肅方纔省悟。,"Lu Su left much piqued and went to see Zhuge Liang to whom he told the story. Zhuge Liang only smiled.""Why do you smile?"" said Lu Su.""I smile at your simplicity. The General is playing a game. Spies cannot easily come and go, so these two have been sent to feign desertion that they may act as spies. The General is meeting one ruse with another. He wants them to give false information. Deceit is not to be despised in war, and his scheme is the correct one to employ.""Then Lu Su understood."
卻說周瑜夜坐帳中，忽見黃蓋潛入軍中來見周瑜。瑜問曰：「公覆夜至，必有良謀見教。」蓋曰：「彼眾我寡，不宜久持，何不用火攻之？」瑜曰：「誰教公獻此計？」蓋曰：「某出自己意，非他人之所教也。」瑜曰：「吾正欲如此，故留蔡中，蔡和詐降之人，以通消息；但恨無一人為我行詐降計耳。」蓋曰：「某願行此計。」瑜曰：「不受些苦，彼如何肯信？」蓋曰：「某受孫氏厚恩，雖肝腦塗地，亦無怨悔。」瑜拜而謝之曰：「君若肯行此苦肉計，則江東之萬幸也。」蓋曰：「某死亦無怨。」遂謝而出。,"That night as Zhou Yu was sitting in his tent, Huang Gai came to see him privately.Zhou Yu said, ""You have surely some wise plan to propose that you come at night like this.""Huang Gai replied, ""The enemy are more numerous than we, and it is wrong to delay. Why not burn them out?""""Who suggested that to you?""""I thought of it myself. Nobody suggested it,"" replied Huang Gai.""I just wanted something like this, and that is why I kept those two pretended deserters. I want them to give some false news. The pity is that I have no one to feign desertion to the other side and work my plan.""""But I will carry out your plan,"" said Huang Gai.""But if you cannot show some injury, you will not be believed,"" said Zhou Yu.""The Sun family have been very generous to me, and I would not resent being crushed to death to repay them,"" said Huang Gai.Zhou Yu bowed and thanked him, saying, ""If you would not object to some bodily suffering, then the South Land would indeed be happy.""""Kill me. I do not mind,"" repeated Huang Gai as he took his leave."
次日，周瑜鳴鼓大會諸將於帳下，孔明亦在座。周瑜曰：「操引百萬之眾，連絡三百餘里，非一日可破。今令諸將各領三個月糧草，準備禦敵。」,"Next day the drums called all the officers together to the Commander-in-Chief's tent, and Zhuge Liang came with the others.Zhou Yu said, ""The enemy's camps extend about one hundred miles so that the campaign will be a long one. Each leader is to prepare supplies for three months."""
言未訖，黃蓋進曰：「莫說三個月；便支三十個月糧草，也不濟事！若是這個月能破便破；若是這個月不能破，只可依張子布之言，棄甲倒戈，北面而降之耳！」,"Scarcely had he spoken when Huang Gai started up, crying, ""Say not three months. Be ready for thirty months, and even then it will not be ended. If you can destroy them this month, then all is well. If you cannot, then it were better to take Zhang Zhao's advice, throw down your weapons, turn to the north, and surrender."""
周瑜勃然變色大怒曰：「吾奉主公之命，督兵破曹，敢有再言降者必斬。今兩軍相敵之際，汝敢出此言，慢我軍心，不斬汝首，難以服眾！」喝左右將黃蓋斬訖報來。黃蓋亦怒曰：「吾自隨破虜將軍，縱橫東南，已歷三世，那有你來？」,"Zhou Yu's anger flared up, and he flushed, crying, ""Our lord's orders were to destroy Cao Cao, and whoever mentioned the word surrender should be put to death! Now, the very moment when the two armies are to engage, you dare talk of surrender and damp the ardor of my army! If I do not slay you, how can I support the others?""He ordered the lictors to remove Huang Gai and execute him without delay.Huang Gai then flamed up in turn, saying, ""This is the third generation since I went with General Sun Jian, and we overran the southeast. Whence have you sprung up?"""
瑜大怒，喝令速斬。甘寧進前告曰：「公覆乃東吳舊臣，望寬恕之。」瑜喝曰：「汝何敢多言，亂吾法度！」先叱左右將甘寧亂棒打出。眾官皆跪告曰：「黃蓋罪固當誅，但於軍不利。望都督寬恕，權且記罪。破曹之後，斬亦未遲。」,"This made Zhou Yu perfectly furious, and Huang Gai was ordered to instant death. But Gan Ning interfered.Said he, ""He is a veteran officer of the South Land. Pray pardon him!""""What are you prating about?"" cried Zhou Yu. ""Dare you come between me and my duty?""Turning to the lictors, Zhou Yu ordered them to drive Gan Ning forth with blows.The other officials fell on their knees entreating pity for Huang Gai.""He is indeed most worthy of death, but it would be a loss to the army. We pray you forgive him. Record his fault for the moment; and after the enemy shall have been defeated, then put him to death."""
瑜怒未息，眾官苦苦告求。瑜曰：「若不看眾官面皮，決須斬首！今且免死！」命左右拖翻，打一百脊杖，以正其罪。眾官又告免，瑜推翻案桌，叱退眾官，喝教行杖。將黃蓋剝了衣服，拖翻在地，打了五十脊杖。眾官又復苦苦求免，瑜躍起指蓋曰：「汝敢小覷我耶！且記下五十棍！再有怠慢，二罪俱罰！」恨聲不絕而入帳中。,"But Zhou Yu was implacable. The officers pleaded with tears.At length he seemed moved, saying, ""Had you not interceded, he should certainly have suffered death. But now I will mitigate the punishment to a beating. He shall not die.""Zhou Yu turned to the lictors and bade them deal the culprit one hundred blows. Again his colleagues prayed for remission, but Zhou Yu angrily pushed over the table in front of him and roared to the officers to get out of the way and let the sentence be executed.So Huang Gai was stripped, thrown to the ground, and fifty blows were given. At this point the officers again prayed that he be let off.Zhou Yu sprang from his chair and pointing his finger at Huang Gai said, ""If you dare flout me again, you shall have the other fifty. If you are guilty of any disrespect, you shall be punished for both faults!""With this he turned into the inner part of the tent, growling as he went."
眾官扶起黃蓋，打得皮開肉綻，鮮血迸流，扶歸本寨，昏絕幾次。動問之人，無不下淚。魯肅也往看問了，來至孔明船中，謂孔明曰：「今日公瑾怒責公覆，我等皆是他部下，不敢犯顏苦諫。先生是客，何故袖手旁觀，不發一語？」孔明笑曰：「子敬欺我。」肅曰：「肅與先生渡江以來，未嘗一事相欺。今何出此言？」孔明曰：「子敬豈不知公瑾今日毒打黃公覆，乃其計耶？如何要我勸他？」肅方悟。孔明曰：「不用苦肉計，何能瞞過曹操？今必令黃公覆去詐降，卻教蔡中，蔡和報知其事矣。子敬見公瑾時，切勿言亮先知其事，只說亮也埋怨都督便了。」,"The officers helped their beaten colleague to his feet. He was in a deplorable state. His back was cut in many places, and the blood was flowing in streams. They led him to his own quarters and on the way he swooned several times. His case seemed most pitiable.Lu Su went to see the suffering officer and then called on Zhuge Liang in his boat.Lu Su related the story of the beating and said, ""Though the other officers have been cowed into silence, I think thought you, Sir, might have interceded. You are a guest and not under Zhou Yu's orders. Why did you stand by with your hands up your sleeves and say never a word?""""You insult me,"" said Zhuge Liang smiling.""Why do you say that? I have never insulted you: Never since the day we came here together.""""Do you not know that terrible beating was but a ruse? How could I try to dissuade Zhou Yu?""Then Lu Su began to perceive, and Zhuge Liang continued, saying, ""Cao Cao would not be taken in unless there was some real bodily suffering. Zhou Yu is going to send Huang Gai over as a deserter, and Zhou Yu will see to it that the two Cao Cao's spies duly tell the tale. But when you see the General, you must not tell him that I saw through the ruse. You say that I am very angry like the others."""
肅辭去，入帳見周瑜，瑜邀入帳後。肅曰：「今日何故痛責黃公覆？」瑜曰：「諸將怨否？」肅曰：「多有心中不安者。」瑜曰：「孔明之意若何？」肅曰：「他也埋怨都督忒薄情。」瑜笑曰：「今番須瞞過他也。」肅曰：「何謂也？」瑜曰：「今日痛打黃蓋，乃計也。吾欲令他詐降，先須用苦肉計，瞞過曹操，就中用火攻之，可以取勝。」肅乃暗思孔明之高見，卻不敢明言。,"Lu Su went to see Zhou Yu and asked, ""Why have you so cruelly beaten a proved and trusty officer?""""Do the officers resent it?"" asked Zhou Yu.""They are all upset about it.""""And what does your friend think?""""Zhuge Liang also resents it in his heart, and he thinks you have made a mistake.""""Then I have deceived him for once,"" said Zhou Yu gleefully.""What mean you?"" cried Lu Su.""That beating that Huang Gai got is part of my ruse. I am sending him to Cao Cao as a deserter, and so I have supplied a reason for desertion. Then I am going to use fire against the enemy.""Lu Su kept silence, but he recognized that Zhuge Liang was again right."
且說黃蓋臥於帳中，眾將皆來動問。蓋不言語，但長吁而已。忽報參謀闞澤來問。蓋令請入臥內，叱退左右。闞澤曰：「將軍莫非與都督有讎？」蓋曰：「非也。」澤曰：「然則公之受責，莫非苦肉計乎？」蓋曰：「何以知之？」澤曰：「某觀公瑾舉動，已料著八九分。」蓋曰：「某受吳侯三世厚恩，無以為報，故獻此計，以破曹操。吾雖受苦，亦無所恨。吾遍觀軍中，無一人可為心腹者。惟公素有忠義之心，敢以心腹相告。」澤曰：「公之告我，無非要我獻詐降書耳。」蓋曰：「實有此意。未知肯否？」闞澤欣然領諾。正是：勇將輕身思報主，謀臣為國有同心。未知闞澤所言若何，且看下文分解。,"Meanwhile Huang Gai lay in his tent, whither all his colleague officers went to condole with him and inquire after his health. But Huang Gai would say never a word. He only lay sighing deeply from time to time.But when the Strategist Kan Ze came, Huang Gai told them to bring him to the room where he lay. Then he bade the servants go away.Kan Ze said, ""Surely you must have some serious quarrel with the General.""""I have none,"" said Huang Gai.""Then this beating is just part of a ruse?""""How did you guess?"" said Huang Gai.""Because I watched the General, and I guessed about nine tenths of the truth.""Huang Gai said, ""You see I have been very generously treated by the Sun family, all three of them, and have no means of showing my gratitude except by offering to help in this ruse. True I suffer, but I do not regret that. Among all those I know in the army, there is not one I am intimate with except yourself. You are true, and I can talk with you as a friend.""""I suppose you wish me to present your surrender letter to Cao Cao. Is that it?""""Just that; will you do it?"" said Huang Gai.Kan Ze consented joyfully.Even the warrior's body is but a stake in the game,The friend so ready to help him proves that their hearts are the same.Kan Ze's reply will be read in the next chapter."
