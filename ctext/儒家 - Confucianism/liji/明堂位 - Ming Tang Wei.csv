昔者周公朝諸侯于明堂之位：天子負斧依南鄉而立；三公，中階之前，北面東上。諸侯之位，阼階之東，西面北上。諸伯之國，西階之西，東面北上。諸子之國，門東，北面東上。諸男之國，門西，北面東上。九夷之國，東門之外，西面北上。八蠻之國，南門之外，北面東上。六戎之國，西門之外，東面南上。五狄之國，北門之外，南面東上。九采之國，應門之外，北面東上。四塞，世告至。此周公明堂之位也。明堂也者，明諸侯之尊卑也。,"Formerly, when the duke of Zhou gave audience to the feudal princes in their several places in the Hall of Distinction, the son of Heaven stood with his back to the axe-embroidered screen, and his face towards the south. The three dukes were in front of the steps, in the middle, with their faces to the north, inclining to the east as the most honourable position. The places of the marquises were at the east of the eastern steps, with their faces to the west, inclining to the north as the most honourable position. The lords of the earldoms were at the west of the western steps, with their faces to the east, inclining also and for the same reason to the north. The counts were on the east of the gate, with their faces to the north, inclining to the east as the more honourable position. The barons were on the west of the gate, with their faces to the north, inclining also and for the same reason to the east. The chiefs of the nine Yi  were outside the eastern door, with their faces to the west, inclining to the north as the position of honour; those of the eight Rong were outside the door on the south, with their faces to the north, inclining for the same reason to the cast; those of the six Zung were outside the door on the west, with their faces to the east, inclining for the same reason to the south; and those of the five Di were outside the door on the north, with their faces to the south, inclining for the same reason to the east. The chiefs of the nine Cai were outside the Ying gate, with their faces to the north, inclining to the east as the position of honour for them; those of the four Sai (also) came, who had only once in their time to announce their arrival (at the court). These were the places of the lords in the Hall of Distinction (when they appeared before) the duke of Zhou. The Hall of Distinction was so called, because in it the rank of the princes was clearly shown as high or low."
昔殷紂亂天下，脯鬼侯以饗諸侯。是以周公相武王以伐紂。武王崩，成王幼弱，周公踐天子之位以治天下；六年，朝諸侯於明堂，制禮作樂，頒度量，而天下大服；七年，致政於成王；成王以周公為有勛勞於天下，是以封周公於曲阜，地方七百里，革車千乘，命魯公世世祀周公天以子之禮樂。,"Formerly, when Zhou of Yin was throwing the whole kingdom into confusion, he made dried slices of (the flesh of) the marquis of Gui, and used them in feasting the princes. On this account the duke of Zhou assisted king Wu in attacking Zhou. When king Wu died, king Cheng being young and weak, the duke took the seat of the son of Heaven, and governed the kingdom. During six years he gave audience to all the princes in the Hall of Distinction; instituted ceremonies, made his instruments of music, gave out his (standard) weights and measures, and there was a grand submission throughout the kingdom. In the seventh year, he resigned the government to king Cheng; and he, in consideration of the duke's services to the kingdom, invested him with (the territory about) Qu-fu, seven hundred li square, and sending forth a thousand chariots of war. He (also) gave charge that (the princes of) Lu, from generation to generation, should sacrifice to the duke of Zhou with the ceremonies and music proper at a sacrifice by the son of Heaven."
是以魯君，孟春乘大路，載弧韣；旗十有二旒，日月之章；祀帝于郊，配以后稷。天子之禮也。,"Thus it was that the rulers of Lu, in the first month of spring, rode in a grand carriage, displaying the banner, suspended from its bow-like arm, with the twelve streamers, and having the sun and moon emblazoned on it, to sacrifice to God in the suburb of their metropolis, associating Hou Ji as his assessor in the service - according to the ceremonies used by the son of Heaven."
季夏六月，以禘禮祀周公於大廟，牲用白牡；尊用犧象山罍；郁尊用黃目；灌用玉瓚大圭；薦用玉豆雕篹；爵用玉琖，仍雕，加以璧散璧角；俎用梡嶡；升歌《清廟》，下管《象》；朱干玉戚，冕而舞《大武》；皮弁素積，裼而舞《大夏》。昧，東夷之樂也；《任》，南蠻之樂也。納夷蠻之樂於大廟，言廣魯於天下也。,"In the last month of summer, the sixth month, they used the ceremonies of the great sacrifice in sacrificing to the duke of Zhou in the great ancestral temple, employing for the victim to him a white bull. The cups were those with the figure of a victim bull, of an elephant, and of hills and clouds; that for the fragrant spirits was the one with gilt eyes on it. For libations they used the cup of jade with the handle made of a long rank-symbol. The dishes with the offerings were on stands of wood, adorned with jade and carved. The cups for the personator were of jade carved in the same way. There were also the plain cups and those of horn, adorned with round pieces of jade; and for the meat-stands, they used those with four feet and the cross-binders. (The singers) went up to the hall (or stage), and sang the Qing Miao; (in the court) below, (the pantomimes) performed the Xiang dance, to the accompaniment of the wind instruments. With their red shields and jade-adorned axes, and in their caps with pendants, they danced to the music of the Da Wu; in their skin caps, and large white skirts gathered at the waist, and jacket of silk, they danced the Da Xia. There (were also) the Mei, or music of the wild tribes of the East; and the Ren, or music of those of the South. The introduction of these two in the grand temple was to signalise the distinction of Lu all over the kingdom."
君卷冕立於阼，夫人副褘立于房中。君肉袒迎牲于門；夫人薦豆籩。卿、大夫贊君，命婦贊夫人：各揚其職。百官廢職服大刑，而天下大服。,"The ruler, in his dragon-figured robe and cap with pendants, stood at the eastern steps; and his wife, in her head-dress and embroidered robe, stood in her room. The ruler, with shoulder bared, met the victim at the gate; his wife brought in the stands for the dishes. The ministers and Great officers assisted the ruler; their wives assisted his wife. Each one discharged the duty proper to him or her. Any officer who neglected his duty was severely punished; and throughout the kingdom there was a great acknowledgment of, and submission to, (the worth of the duke of Zhou)."
是故，夏礿、秋嘗、冬烝，春社、秋省而遂大蜡，天子之祭也。,"(In Lu) they offered (also) the sacrifices of summer, autumn, and winter (in the ancestral temple); with those at the altars of the land and grain in spring, and that at the autumnal hunt, going on to the great sacrifice of thanksgiving at the end of the year - all (after the pattern of) the sacrifices of the son of Heaven."
