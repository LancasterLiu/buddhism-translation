子曰：「君子之教以孝也，非家至而日見之也。教以孝，所以敬天下之為人父者也。教以悌，所以敬天下之為人兄者也。教以臣，所以敬天下之為人君者也。《詩》云：『愷悌君子，民之父母。』非至德，其孰能順民如此其大者乎！」,"The Master said, ""The teaching of filial piety by the superior man does not require that he should go to family after family and daily see the members of each. His teaching of filial piety is a tribute of reverence to all the fathers under heaven. His teaching of fraternal submission is a tribute of reverence to all the elder brothers under heaven. His teaching of the duty of a subject is a tribute of reverence to all the rulers under heaven.It is said in the Book of Poetry: The happy and courteous sovereign Is the parent of the people.If it were not a perfect virtue, how could it be recognized as in accordance with their nature by the people so extensively as this?"""
