If they were his neighbors, then he would have run them off. What a pity, when people turn to making the robe before the tunic is complete."
聖人耳不順乎非，口不肄乎善。賢者耳擇口擇，眾人無擇焉。或問「眾人」。曰：「富貴生。」「賢者」？曰：「義。」「聖人」？曰：「神。」觀乎賢人，則見眾人；觀乎聖人，則見賢人；觀乎天地，則見聖人。,"The sage's ear does not follow what is false, nor does his mouth work at sounding good.
