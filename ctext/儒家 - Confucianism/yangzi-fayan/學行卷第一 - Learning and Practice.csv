學，行之，上也；言之，次也；教人，又其次也。咸無焉，為眾人。,"As for learning, putting it into practice is best; putting it into words is second best; instructing others is next. To do none of these is to be a common person."

Sharpening and polishing, their zhi lies in these; if this was not the case, then you might as well stop."

學以治之，思以精之，朋友以磨之，名譽以崇之，不倦以終之，可謂好學也已矣。,"Studying in order to cultivate it, thinking in order to refine it, making friends in order to polish it, achieving fame in order to venerate it, being untiring in order to finish it: this can be referred to as loving to learn."

習乎習，以習非之勝是也，況習是之勝非乎？於戲，學者審其是而已矣！或曰：「焉知是而習之？」曰：「視日月而知眾星之蔑也，仰聖人而知眾說之小也。」,"Practice, practice! By means of practicing what is false, one overcomes what is true.

Can they still be studied?Yangzi said: They can.The other person snickered, saying: They should only be used for passing government exams and determining ranks.Yangzi said: Great men study for the Dao; small men study for profit. Are you for the Dao, or are you for profit?The other said: Plowing without any harvest, hunting without a feast: are these really ""plowing"" and ""hunting""?Yangzi said: Planting the Dao and getting the Dao, hunting de and getting de, these are the harvest and feast. I have never seen Shen and Chen side by side. Therefore, the junzi values changing for the good. Those who change for the good, are they not the sage's followers? The hundred rivers study the sea and arrive at the sea; mounds and foothills study the mountains but do not reach to the mountains. For this reason, the junzi hates to draw the line."

When merchants talk together, they discuss wealth and profit. So much for his wealth!

Studying and transmitting Confucius's teaching without stopping — Yan Yuan.The other said: One couldn't hope to establish the Dao like Confucius. One couldn't have the strength to transmit the teaching like Yan Yuan.Yangzi said: You have not yet thought about it. Who is stopping you?
