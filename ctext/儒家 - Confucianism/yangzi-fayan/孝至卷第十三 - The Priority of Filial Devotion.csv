孝，至矣乎！一言而該，聖人不加焉。,"Filial devotion is the highest priority! In this one word all is complete, [even] the sage [cannot] add to it!"
父母，子之天地與？無天何生？無地何形？天地裕於萬物乎？萬物裕於天地乎？裕父母之裕，不裕矣。事父母自知不足者，其舜乎？,"The father and mother are the child's Heaven and Earth. Without Heaven, how is one born? Without Earth, how is one formed? Are Heaven and Earth generous to the ten thousand things, or are the ten thousand things generous to Heaven and Earth? The ""generosity"" of being generous to ones father and mother is not ""generosity!"" One who served his father and mother and yet knew in himself that it was not enough—wasn't this Shun?"
不可得而久者，事親之謂也。孝子愛日。,That which cannot be prolonged enough—this is called serving one's parents. A filial son values each day he has with them.
孝子有祭乎？有齊乎？夫能存亡形，屬荒絕者，惟齊也。故孝子之於齊，見父母之存也，是以祭不賓。人而不祭，豺獺乎！,"Does a filial son not make offerings to his ancestors? Does he not fast? Now, only through the fast is one able to make the deceased's image survive and feel connected to those who are gone. Thus, in fasting a filial son preserves a vision of his father and mother. Because of this, during the fast, one does not take guests. Men who do not make offerings to their ancestors, are they even as good as jackals and otters?"
或問「子」。曰：「死生盡禮，可謂能子乎！」,"Someone asked about being a son.Yangzi said: If one exhausts li both during his parents life and after their death, then may he not be referred to as a capable son?"
曰：「石奮、石建，父子之美也。無是父，無是子；無是子，無是父。」或曰：「必也，兩乎？」曰：「與堯無子，舜無父，不如堯父舜子也。」,"Yangzi said: Shi Fen and Shi Jian were the perfect father and son. Without this father, there would not have been such a son. Without this son, there would not have been such a father.Someone said: Must there be both?Yangzi said: Rather than Yao not having a son and Shun not having a father, it would have been better had Yao been the father and Shun the son."
「子有含菽縕絮而致滋美其親，將以求孝也。人曰偽，如之何？」曰：「假儒衣書，服而讀之，三月不歸，孰曰非儒也？」或曰：「何以處偽？」曰：「有人則作，無人則輟之謂偽。觀人者，審其作輟而已矣。」,"A son eats coarse food and wears tattered clothing while he gives the good food and beautiful clothing to his parents, because he seeks to be filial. If some say he is a phony, what can be done about it?Yangzi said: Suppose he wore a ru's robes and read the Confucian books for three months without any lapse. Who would say he was not a ru?The other said: How can you tell if he is a phony?Yangzi said: If he does it when others are around, but stops when others are not around, then he can be called phony. In observing people, simply examine when they act and when they stop, and that's all."
不為名之名，其至矣乎！為名之名，其次也。,The good reputation that one makes without seeking is best. The reputation one makes by seeking after it is merely second best.

Plans that accord with those of Gao Yao are referred to as excellent.The other said: What if this standard is too lofty?Yangzi said: Indeed, one must simply be diligent and that's all. If the standard were lower, then Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Shang Yang, and Li Si would also be considered loyal and excellent."
堯、舜之道皇兮，夏、殷、周之道將兮，而以延其光兮。或曰：「何謂也？」曰：「堯、舜以其讓，夏以其功，殷、周以其伐。」,"The dao of Yao and Shun was august! The dao of the Xia, Yin, and Zhou was magnificent! Thus their glory lives on!The other said: What do you mean?Yangzi said: Yao and Shun were glorious by means of abdicating the throne. The Xia were glorious because of their meritorious deeds, and the Yin and Zhou because of their righteous military campaigns."
或曰：「食如蟻，衣如華，朱輪駟馬，金朱煌煌，無已泰乎？」曰：「由其德，舜、禹受天下不為泰。不由其德，五兩之綸，半通之銅，亦泰矣。」,"Someone said: Food as delicate and finely prepared as little ants, robes as beautiful as paintings, a vermilion wheeled four-horse chariot, and a glittering gold seal with the vermilion silk ribbons—is this not excessive? Yangzi said: Because of their de, Shun and Yu's inheritance of all under Heaven was not excessive; but if it is not because of one's de, then even five strands of silk and the copper seal of the lowest office is still too excessive."

In terms of wisdom and de, are there not also those who compare in this way?Yangzi said: These are merely cases of one man being like a hundred. De that allows one to harmonize with the stupid and foolish, and to abdicate the ten thousand kingdoms; wisdom that clearly perceives Heaven and Earth, and can give form to unfathomable profundity—are these merely equal to the de and wisdom of a hundred men?"
或問「君」。曰：「明光。」問「臣」。曰：「若禔。」「敢問何謂也？」曰：「君子在上，則明而光其下；在下，則順而安其上。」,"Someone asked about the ruler.Yangzi said: He should be bright and illuminating.The other asked about the minister.Yangzi said: He should be dutiful and have a settling influence. The other said: May I ask to what you refer?Yangzi said: When a junzi is in a high position, then he is bright and illuminates those below. When he is in a low position, then he is dutiful and has a settling influence on those above."
或曰：「聖人事異乎？」曰：「聖人德之為事，異亞之。故常修德者，本也；見異而修德者，末也。本末不修而存者，未之有也。」,"Someone asked: Does the sage give attention to strange phenomena?Yangzi said: The sage attends to de; strange phenomena are secondary. Thus, constantly cultivating de—this is to grasp the root. Waiting to see strange phenomena and only then cultivating de—this is to grasp the tip of the branch. To cultivate neither the root nor the tip of the branch and yet survive—there has yet to be a case of this."

周康之時，頌聲作乎下，《關雎》作乎上，習治也。齊桓之時縕，而《春秋》美邵陵，習亂也。故習治則傷始亂也。習亂，則好始洽也。,"In King Kang of the Zhou's time, hymns of praise were sung from below, while the ""Guan Ju (The Ospreys)"" was written above. This is because the people were accustomed to order.Duke Huan of Qi's time was chaotic, and the Spring and Autumn Annals praised the peace reached by Qi and Chu at Shaoling, because the people were accustomed to chaos. Thus, if one is accustomed to order, then he worries at the first appearance of chaos. If one is accustomed to chaos, one delights in the first appearance of order."

Is this not like the generosity of sacrificial offerings?Yangzi said: In the past, in the time of Gaozu, Emperor Wen, and Emperor Wu, the Xiongnu were indeed the military's top priority. Now their ministers come and kotow, and they are called ""the northern frontier."" This is for the spirits of our ancestors and the spirits of Earth and grain.

The imperial university is the means to establish it; schools and study are the means to teach it; li and music are the means to express it; carriages and robes are the means to display it. To return to the well-field system and corporeal punishment, and to release people from slavery —now that is greatness!"
