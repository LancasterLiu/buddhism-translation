喓喓草蟲、趯趯阜螽未見君子、憂心忡忡。亦既見止、亦既覯止、我心則降。,"Yao-yao went the grass-insects,And the hoppers sprang about.While I do not see my lord,My sorrowful heart is agitated.Let me have seen him,Let me have met him,And my heart will then be stilled."
陟彼南山、言采其蕨。未見君子、憂心惙惙。亦既見止、亦既覯止、我心則說。,"I ascended that hill in the south,And gathered the turtle-foot ferns.While I do not see my lord,My sorrowful heart is very sad.Let me have seen him,Let me have met him,And my heart will then be pleased."
陟彼南山、言采其薇。未見君子、我心傷悲。亦既見止、亦既覯止、我心則夷。,"I ascended that hill in the south,And gathered the thorn-ferns.While I do not see my lord,My sorrowful heart is wounded with grief.Let me have seen him,Let me have met him,And my heart will then be at peace."
