厭浥行露、豈不夙夜、謂行多露。,Wet lay the dew on the path:Might I not [have walked there] in the early dawn?But I said there was [too] much dew on the path.
誰謂雀無角、何以穿我屋。誰謂女無家、何以速我獄。雖速我獄、室家不足。,"Who can say the sparrow has no horn?How else could it bore through my house?Who can say that you did not get me betrothed?How else could you have urged on this trial?But though you have forced me to trial,Your ceremonies for betrothal were not sufficient."
誰謂鼠無牙、何以穿我墉。誰謂女無家、何以速我訟。雖速我訟、亦不女從。,"Who can say that the rat has no molar teeth?How else could it bore through my wall?Who can say that you did not get me betrothed?How else could you have urged on this trial?But though you have forced me to trial,I will still not follow you."
