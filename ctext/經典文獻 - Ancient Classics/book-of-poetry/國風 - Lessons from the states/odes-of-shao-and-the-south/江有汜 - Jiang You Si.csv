江有汜、之子歸、不我以。不我以、其後也悔。,"The Jiang has its branches, led from it and returning to it.Our lady, when she was married,Would not employ us.She would not employ us;But afterwards she repented."
江有渚、之子歸、不我與。不我與、其後也處。,"The Jiang has its islets.Our lady, when she was married,Would not let us be with her.She would not let us be with her;But afterwards she repressed [such feelings]."
江有沱、之子歸、不我過。不我過、其嘯也歌。,"The Jiang has the Tuo.Our lady, when she was married,Would not come near usShe would not come near us;But she blew that feeling away, and sang."
