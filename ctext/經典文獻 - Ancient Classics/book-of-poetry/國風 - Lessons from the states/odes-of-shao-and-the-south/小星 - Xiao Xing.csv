嘒彼小星、三五在東。肅肅宵征、夙夜在公、寔命不同。,"Small are those starlets,Three or five of them in the east,Swiftly by night we go;In the early dawn we are with the prince.Our lot is not like hers."
嘒彼小星、維參與昴。肅肅宵征、抱衾與裯、寔命不猶。,"Small are those starlets,And there are Orion and the Pleiades.Swiftly by night we go,Carrying our coverlets and sheets.Our lot is not like hers."
