坎坎伐檀兮、寘之河之干兮、河水清且漣猗。不稼不穡、胡取禾三百廛兮。不狩不獵、胡瞻爾庭有縣貆兮。彼君子兮、不素餐兮。,"Kan-kan go his blows on the sandal trees,And he places what he hews on the river's bank,Whose waters flow clear and rippling.You sow not nor reap; -How do you get the produce of those three hundred farms?You do not follow the chase; -How do we see the badgers hanging up in your court-yards?O that superior man!He would not eat the bread of idleness!"
坎坎伐輻兮、寘之河之側兮、河水清且直猗。不稼不穡、胡取禾三百億兮。不狩不獵、胡瞻爾庭有縣特兮。彼君子兮、不素食兮。,"Kan-kan go his blows on the wood for his spokes,And he places it by the side of the river,Whose waters flow clear and even.You sow not nor reap; -How do you get your three millions of sheaves?You do not follow the chase; -How do we see those three-year-olds hanging in your court-yards?O that superior man!He would not eat the bread of idleness!"
坎坎伐輪兮、寘之河之漘兮、河水清且淪猗。不稼不穡、胡取禾三百囷兮。不狩不獵、胡瞻爾庭有縣鶉兮。彼君子兮、不素飧兮。,"Kan-kan go his blows on the wood for his wheels,And he places it by the lip of the river,Whose waters flow clear in rippling circles.You sow not nor reap; -How do you get the paddy for your three hundred round binns?You do not follow the chase; -How do we see the quails hanging in your court-yards?O that superior man!He would not eat the bread of idleness!"
