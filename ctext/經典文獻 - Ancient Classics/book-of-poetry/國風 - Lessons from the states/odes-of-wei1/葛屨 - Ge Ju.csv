糾糾葛屨、可以履霜。摻摻女手、可以縫裳。要之襋之、好人服之。,"Shoes thinly woven of the dolichos fibre,May be used to walk on the hoarfrost.The delicate fingers of a bride,May be used in making clothes.[His bride] puts the waistband to his lower garment and the collar to his upper,And he, a wealthy man, wears them."
好人提提、宛然左辟、佩其象揥。維是褊心、是以為刺。,"Wealthy, he moves about quite at ease,And politely he stands aside to the left.From his girdle hangs his ivory comb-pin.It is the narrowness of his disposition,Which makes him a subject for satire."
