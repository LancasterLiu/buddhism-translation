衡門之下、可以棲遲。泌之洋洋、可以樂飢。,"Beneath my door made of cross pieces of wood,I can rest at my leisure;By the wimpling stream from my fountain,I can joy amid my hunger."
豈其食魚、必河之魴。豈其取妻、必齊之姜。,"Why, in eating fish;Must we have bream from the He?Why, in taking a wife,Must we have a Jiang of Qi?"
豈其食魚、必河之鯉。豈其取妻、必宋之子。,"Why, in eating fish;Must we have carp from the He?Why, in taking a wife,Must we have a Zi of Song?"
