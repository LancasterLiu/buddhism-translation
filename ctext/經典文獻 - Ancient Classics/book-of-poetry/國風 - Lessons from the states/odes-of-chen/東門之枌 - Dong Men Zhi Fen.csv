東門之枌、宛丘之栩。子仲之子、婆娑其下。,"[There are] the white elms at the east gate.And the oaks on Wanqiu;The daughter of Zizhong,Dances about under them."
穀旦于差、南方之原。不績其麻、市也婆娑。,"A good morning having been chosen,For the plain in the South,She leaves twisting her hemp,And dances to it through the market-place."
穀旦于逝、越以鬷邁。視爾如荍、貽我握椒。,"The morning being good for excursion,They all proceed together.'I look on you as the flower of the thorny mallows;You give me a stalk of the pepper plant."
