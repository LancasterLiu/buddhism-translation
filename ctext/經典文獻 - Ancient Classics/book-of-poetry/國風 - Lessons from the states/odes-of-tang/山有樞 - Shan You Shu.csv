山有漆、隰有栗。子有酒食、何不日鼓瑟。且以喜樂、且以永日。宛其死矣、他人入室。,"On the mountains are the varnish trees,In the low wet grounds are the chestnuts.You have spirits and viands; -Why not daily play your lute?Both to give a zest to your joy,And to prolong the day?You will drop off in death,And another person will enter your chamber."
