揚之水、白石鑿鑿。素衣朱襮、從子于沃。既見君子、云何不樂。,"Amidst the fretted waters,The white rocks stand up grandly.Bringing a robe of white silk, with a vermillion collar,We will follow you to Wo.When we have seen the princely lord,Shall we not rejoice?"
揚之水、白石皓皓。素衣朱繡、從子于鵠。既見君子、云何其憂。,"Amidst the fretted waters,The white rocks stand glistening.Bringing a robe of white silk, with a vermillion collar, and embroidered,We will follow you to Hu.When we have seen the princely lord,What sorrow will remain to us?"
揚之水、白石粼粼。我聞有命、不敢以告人。,"Amidst the fretted waters,The white rocks clearly show.We have heard your orders,And will not dare to inform any one of them."
