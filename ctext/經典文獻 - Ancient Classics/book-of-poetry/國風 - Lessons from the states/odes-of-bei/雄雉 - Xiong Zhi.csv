雄雉于飛、泄泄其羽。我之懷矣、自詒伊阻。,"The male pheasant flies away,Lazily moving his wings.The man of my heart! -He has brought on us this separation."
雄雉于飛、下上其音。展矣君子、實勞我心。,"The pheasant has flown away,But from below, from above, comes his voice.Ah! the princely man! -He afflicts my heart."
瞻彼日月、悠悠我思。道之云遠、曷云能來。,"Look at that sun and moon!Long, long do I think.The way is distant;How can he come to me?"
百爾君子、不知德行。不忮不求、何用不臧。,"All ye princely men,Know ye not his virtuous conduct?He hates none; he covets nothing; -What does he which is not good?"
