毖彼泉水、亦流于淇。有懷于衛、靡日不思。孌彼諸姬、聊與之謀。,"How the water bubbles up from that spring,And flows away to the Qi!My heart is in Wei;There is not a day I do not think of it.Admirable are those, my cousins;I will take counsel with them."
出宿于泲、飲餞于禰。女子有行、遠父母兄弟。問我諸姑、遂及伯姊。,"When I came forth, I lodged in Ji,And we drank the cup of convoy at Ni.When a young lady goes [to be married],She leaves her parents and brothers;[But] I would ask for my aunts,And then for my elder sister."
出宿于干、飲餞于言。載脂載牽、還車言邁。遄臻于衛、不瑕有害。,"I will go forth and lodge in Gan,And we drink the cup of convoy at Yan.I will grease the axle and fix the pin,And the returning chariot will proceed.Quickly shall we arrive in Wei; -But would not this be wrong?"
我思肥泉、茲之永歎。思須與漕、我心悠悠。駕言出遊、以寫我憂。,"I think of the Feiquan,I am ever sighing about it.I think of Xu and Cao,Long, long, my heart dwells with them.Let me drive forth and travel there,To dissipate my sorrow."
