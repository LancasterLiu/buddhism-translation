出自北門、憂心殷殷。終窶且貧、莫知我艱。已焉哉、天實為之、謂之何哉。,"I go out at the north gate,With my heart full of sorrow.Straitened am I and poor,And no one takes knowledge of my distress.So it is!Heaven has done it; -What then shall I say?"
王事適我、政事一埤益我。我入自外、室人交徧讁我。已焉哉、天實為之、謂之何哉。,"The king's business comes on me,And the affairs of our government in increasing measure.When I come home from abroad,The members of my family all emulously reproach me.So it is!Heaven has done it; -What then shall I say?"
王事敦我、政事一埤遺我。我入自外、室人交徧摧我。已焉哉、天實為之、謂之何哉。,"The king's business is thrown on me,And the affairs of our government are left to me more and more.When I come home from abroad,The members of my family all emulously thrust at me.So it is!Heaven has done it; -What then shall I say?"
