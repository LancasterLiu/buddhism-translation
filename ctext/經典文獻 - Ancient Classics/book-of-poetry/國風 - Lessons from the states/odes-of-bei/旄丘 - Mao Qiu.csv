旄丘之葛兮、何誕之節兮。叔兮伯兮、何多日也。,"The dolichos on that high and sloping mound; -How wide apart are [now] its joints!O ye uncles,Why have ye delayed these many days?"
何其處也、必有與也。何其久也、必有以也。,Why do they rest without stirring?It must be they expect allies.Why do they prolong the time?There must be a reason for their conduct.
狐裘蒙戎、匪車不東。叔兮伯兮、靡所與同。,"Our fox-furs are frayed and worn.Came our carriages not eastwards?O ye uncles,You do not sympathize with us."
瑣兮尾兮、流離之子。叔兮伯兮、褎如充耳。,"Fragments, and a remnant,Children of dispersion [are we]!O ye uncles,Notwithstanding your full robes, your ears are stopped."
