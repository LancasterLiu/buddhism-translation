燕燕于飛、差池其羽。之子于歸、遠送于野。瞻望弗及、泣涕如雨。,"The swallows go flying about,With their wings unevenly displayed.The lady was returning [to her native state],And I escorted her far into the country.I looked till I could no longer see her,And my tears fell down like rain."
燕燕于飛、頡之頏之。之子于歸、遠于將之。瞻望弗及、佇立以泣。,"The swallows go flying about,Now up, now down.The lady was returning [to her native state],And far did I accompany her.I looked till I could no longer see her,And long I stood and wept."
燕燕于飛、下上其音。之子于歸、遠送于南。瞻望弗及、實勞我心。,"The swallows go flying about;From below, from above, comes their twittering.The lady was returning [to her native state],And far did I escort her to the south.I looked till I could no longer see her,And great was the grief of my heart."
仲氏任只、其心塞淵。終溫且惠、淑慎其身。先君之思、以勗寡人。,"Lovingly confiding was lady Zhong;Truly deep was her feeling.Both gentle was she and docile,Virtuously careful of her person.In thinking of our deceased lord,She stimulated worthless me."
