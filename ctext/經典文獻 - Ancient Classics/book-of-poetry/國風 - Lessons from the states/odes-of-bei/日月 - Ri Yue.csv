日居月諸、照臨下土。乃如之人兮、逝不古處。胡能有定、寧不我顧。,"O sun; O moon,Which enlighten this lower earth!Here is the man,Who treats me not according to the ancient rule.How can he get his mind settled?Would he then not regard me?"
日居月諸、下土是冒。乃如之人兮、逝不相好。胡能有定、寧不我報。,"O sun; O moon,Which overshadow this lower earth!Here is this man,Who will not be friendly with me.How can he get his mind settled?Would he then not respond to me?"
日居月諸、出自東方。乃如之人兮、德音無良。胡能有定、俾也可忘。,"O sun; O moon,Which come forth from the east!Here is the man,With virtuous words, but really not good.How can he get his mind settled?Would he then allow me to be forgotten?"
日居月諸、東方自出。父兮母兮、畜我不卒。胡能有定、報我不述。,"O sun; o moon,From the east which come forth!O father, O mother,There is no sequel to your nourishing of me.How can he get his mind settled?Would he then respond to me, contrary to all reason?"
