靜女其姝、俟我於城隅。愛而不見、搔首踟躕。,"How lovely is the retiring girl!She was to await me at a corner of the wall.Loving and not seeing her,I scratch my head, and am in perplexity."
靜女其孌、貽我彤管。彤管有煒、說懌女美。,How handsome is the retiring girl!She presented to me a red tube.Bright is the red tube; -I delight in the beauty of the girl.
自牧歸荑、洵美且異。匪女之為美、美人之貽。,"From the pasture lands she gave a shoot of the white grass,Truly elegant and rare.It is not you, O grass, that are elegant; -You are the gift of an elegant girl."
