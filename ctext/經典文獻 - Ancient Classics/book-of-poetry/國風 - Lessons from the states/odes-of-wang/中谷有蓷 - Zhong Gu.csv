中谷有蓷、暵其乾矣。有女仳離、嘅其嘆矣。嘅其嘆矣、遇人之艱難矣。,"In the valleys grows the mother-wort,But scorched is it in the drier places.There is a woman forced to leave her husband;Sadly she sighs!Sadly she sighs!She suffers from his hard lot."
中谷有蓷、暵其脩矣。有女仳離、條其歗矣。條其歗矣、遇人之不淑矣。,"In the valleys grows the mother-wort,But scorched is it where it had become long.There is a woman forced to leave her husband;Long-drawn are her groanings!Long-drawn are her groanings!She suffers from his misfortune."
中谷有蓷、暵其濕矣。有女仳離、啜其泣矣。啜其泣矣、何嗟及矣。,"In the valleys grows the mother-wort,But scorched is it even in the moist places.There is a woman forced to leave her husband;Ever flow her tears!Ever flow her tears!But of what avail is her lament?"
