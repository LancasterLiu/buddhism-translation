彼黍離離、彼稷之苗。行邁靡靡、中心搖搖。知我者、謂我心憂、不知我者、謂我何求。悠悠蒼天、此何人哉。,"There was the millet with its drooping heads;There was the sacrificial millet coming into blade.Slowly I moved about,In my heart all-agitated.Those who knew me,Said I was sad at heart.Those who did not know me,Said I was seeking for something.O distant and azure Heaven!By what man was this [brought about]?"
