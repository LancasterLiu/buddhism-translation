君子于役、不知其期、曷至哉。雞棲于塒、日之夕矣、羊牛下來。君子于役、如之何勿思。,"My husband is away on service,And I know not when he will return.Where is he now?The fowls roost in their holes in the walls;And in the evening of the day,The goats and cows come down [from the hill];But my husband is away on service.How can I but keep thinking of him?"
君子于役、不日不月、曷其有佸。雞棲于桀、日之夕矣、羊牛下括。君子于役、苟無飢渴。,"My husband is away on service,Not for days [merely] or for months.When will he come back to me?The fowls roost on their perches;And in the evening of the day,The goats and cows come down and home;But my husband is away on service.Oh if he be but kept from hunger and thirst!"
