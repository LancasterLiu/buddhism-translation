有車鄰鄰、有馬白顛。未見君子、寺人之令。,"He has many carriages, giving forth their lin-lin;He has horses with their white foreheads.Before we can see our prince,We must get the services of the eunuch."
阪有漆、隰有栗。既見君子、並坐鼓瑟。今者不樂、逝者其耋。,"On the hill-sides are varnish trees;In the low wet grounds are chestnuts.When we have seen our prince,We sit together with him, and they play on their lutes.If now we do not take our joy,The time will pass till we are octogenarians."
阪有桑、隰有楊。既見君子、並坐鼓簧。今者不樂、逝者其亡。,"On the hill-sides are mulberry trees;In the low wet grounds are willows.When we have seen our prince,We sit together with him, and they play on their organs.If now we do not take our joy,The time will pass till we are no more."
