小戎俴收、五楘梁輈。游環脅驅、陰靷鋈續、文茵暢轂、駕我騏馵。言念君子、溫其如玉。在其板屋、亂我心曲。,"[There is] his short war carriage; -With the ridge-like end of its pole, elegantly bound in five places;With its slip rings and side straps,And the traces attached by gilt rings to the masked transverse;With its beautiful mat of tiger's skin, and its long naves;With its piebalds, and horses with white left feet.When I think of my husband [thus],Looking bland and soft as a piece of jade;Living there in his plank house;It sends confusion into all the corners of my heart."
四牡孔阜、六轡在手、騏駵是中、騧驪是驂、龍盾之合、鋈以觼軜。言念君子、溫其在邑。方何為期、胡然我念之。,"His four horses are in very fine condition,And the six reins are in the hand [of the charioteer].Piebald, and bay with black mane, are the insides;Yellow with black mouth, and black, are the outsides;Side by side are placed the dragon-figured shields;Gilt are the buckles for the inner reins.I think of my husband [thus],Looking so mild in the cities there.What time can be fixed for his return?Oh! how I think of him!"
俴駟孔羣、厹矛鋈錞、蒙伐有苑、虎韔鏤膺、交韔二弓、竹閉緄縢。言念君子、載寢載興。厭厭良人、秩秩德音。,"His mail-covered team moves in great harmony;There are the trident spears with their gilt ends;And the beautiful feather-figured shield;With the tiger-skin bow-case, and the carved metal ornaments on its front.The two bows are placed in the case,Bound with string to their bamboo frames.I think of my husband,When I lie down and rise up.Tranquil and serene is the good man,With his virtuous fame spread far and near."
