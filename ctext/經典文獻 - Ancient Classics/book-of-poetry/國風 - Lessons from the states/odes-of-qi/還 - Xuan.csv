子之還兮、遭我乎峱之閒兮。並驅從兩肩兮、揖我謂我儇兮。,"How agile you are!You met me in the neighbourhood of Nao,And we pursued together two boars of three years.You bowed to me, and said that I was active."
子之茂兮、遭我乎峱之道兮。並驅從兩牡兮、揖我謂我好兮。,"How admirable your skill!You met me in the way to Nao,And we drove together after two males.You bowed to me, and said that I was skilful."
子之昌兮、遭我乎峱之陽兮。並驅從兩狼兮、揖我謂我臧兮。,"How complete your art!You met me on the south of Nao,And we pursued together two wolves.You bowed to me, and said that I was dexterous."
