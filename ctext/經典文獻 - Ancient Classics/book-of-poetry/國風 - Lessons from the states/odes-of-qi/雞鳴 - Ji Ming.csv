雞既鳴矣、朝既盈矣。匪雞則鳴、蒼蠅之聲。,' The cock has crowed;The court is full. 'But it was not the cock that was crowing; -It was the sound of the blue flies.
東方明矣、朝既昌矣。匪東方則明、月出之光。,' The east is bright;The court is crowded. 'But it was not the east that was bright; -It was the light of the moon coming forth.
蟲飛薨薨、甘與子同夢。會且歸矣、無庶予子憎。,' The insects are flying in buzzing crowds;It would be sweet to lie by you and dream. 'But the assembled officers will be going home; -Let them not hate both me and you. '
