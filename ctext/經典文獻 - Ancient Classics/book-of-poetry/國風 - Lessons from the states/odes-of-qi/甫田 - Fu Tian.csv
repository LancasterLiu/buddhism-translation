無田甫田、維莠桀桀。無思遠人、勞心怛怛。,Do not try to cultivate fields too large; -The weeds will only grow proudly.Do not think of winning people far away; -Your toiling heart will be distressed.
婉兮孌兮、總角丱兮。未幾見兮、突而弁兮。,"How young and tender,Is the child with his two tufts of hair!When you see him after not a long time,Lo! he is wearing the cap!"
