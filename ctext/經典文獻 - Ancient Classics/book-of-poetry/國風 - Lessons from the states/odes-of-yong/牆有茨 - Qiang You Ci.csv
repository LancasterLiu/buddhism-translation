牆有茨、不可埽也。中冓之言、不可道也。所可道也、言之醜也。,"The tribulus grows on the wall,And cannot be brushed away.The story of the inner chamber,Cannot be told.What would have to be told,Would be the vilest of recitals."
牆有茨、不可襄也。中冓之言、不可詳也。所可詳也、言之長也。,"The tribulus grow on the wall,And cannot be removed.The story of the inner chamber,Cannot be particularly related.What might be particularly relatedWould be a long story."
牆有茨、不可束也。中冓之言、不可讀也。所可讀也、言之辱也。,"The tribulus grow on the wall,And cannot be bound together, [and taken away].The story of the inner chamberCannot be recited,What might be recited,Would be the most disgraceful of things."
