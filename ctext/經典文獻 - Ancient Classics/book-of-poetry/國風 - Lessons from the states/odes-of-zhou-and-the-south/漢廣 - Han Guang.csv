南有喬木、不可休息。漢有游女、不可求思。漢之廣矣、不可泳思。江之永矣、不可方思。,"In the south rise the trees without branches,Affording no shelter.By the Han are girls rambling about,But it is vain to solicit them.The breadth of the HanCannot be dived across;The length of the JiangCannot be navigated with a raft."
翹翹錯薪、言刈其楚。之子于歸、言秣其馬。漢之廣矣、不可泳思。江之永矣、不可方思。,"Many are the bundles of firewood;I would cut down the thorns [to form more].Those girls that are going to their future home, -I would feed their horses.The breadth of the HanCannot be dived across;The length of the Jiang,Cannot be navigated with a raft."
