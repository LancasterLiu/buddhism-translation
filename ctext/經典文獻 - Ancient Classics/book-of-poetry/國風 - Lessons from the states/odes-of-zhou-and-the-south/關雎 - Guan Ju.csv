關關雎鳩、在河之洲。窈窕淑女、君子好逑。,"Guan-guan go the ospreys,On the islet in the river.The modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady:For our prince a good mate she."
參差荇菜、左右流之。窈窕淑女、寤寐求之。求之不得、寤寐思服。悠哉悠哉、輾轉反側。,"Here long, there short, is the duckweed,To the left, to the right, borne about by the current.The modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady:Waking and sleeping, he sought her.He sought her and found her not,And waking and sleeping he thought about her.Long he thought; oh! long and anxiously;On his side, on his back, he turned, and back again."
參差荇菜、左右采之。窈窕淑女、琴瑟友之。參差荇菜、左右芼之。窈窕淑女、鍾鼓樂之。,"Here long, there short, is the duckweed;On the left, on the right, we gather it.The modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady:With lutes, small and large, let us give her friendly welcome.Here long, there short, is the duckweed;On the left, on the right, we cook and present it.The modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady:With bells and drums let us show our delight in her."
