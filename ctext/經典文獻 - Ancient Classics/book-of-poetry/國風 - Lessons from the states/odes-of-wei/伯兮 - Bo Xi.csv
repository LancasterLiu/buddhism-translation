伯兮朅兮、邦之桀兮。伯也執殳、為王前驅。,"My noble husband is how martial-like!The hero of the country!My husband, grasping his halberd,Is in the leading chariot of the king's [host]."
自伯之東、首如飛蓬。豈無膏沐、誰適為容。,"Since my husband went to the east,My head has been like the flying [pappus of the] artemisia.It is not that I could not anoint and wash it;But for whom should I adorn myself?"
其雨其雨、杲杲出日。願言思伯、甘心首疾。,"O for rain! O for rain!But brightly the sun comes forth.Longingly I think of my husband,Till my heart is weary, and my head aches."
焉得諼草、言樹之背。願言思伯、使我心痗。,"How shall I get the plant of forgetfulness?I would plant it on the north of my house.Longingly I think of my husband,And my heart is made to ache."
