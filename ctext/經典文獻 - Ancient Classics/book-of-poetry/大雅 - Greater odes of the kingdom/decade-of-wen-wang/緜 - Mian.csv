古公亶父、來朝走馬。率西水滸、至于岐下。爰及姜女、聿來胥宇。,"The ancient duke Dan-fu,Came in the morning, galloping his horses,Along the banks of the western rivers,To the foot of [mount] Qi;And there, he and the lady Jiang,Came, and together looked out for a site on which to settle."
周原膴膴、菫茶如飴。爰始爰謀、爰契我龜。曰止曰時、築室于茲。,"The plain of Zhou looked beautiful and rich,With its violets and sowthistles [sweet] as dumplings.There he began with consulting [his followers];There he singed the tortoise-shell, [and divined].The responses were - there to stay, and then;And they proceeded there to build their houses."
迺慰迺止、迺左迺右、迺疆迺理、迺宣迺畝、自西徂東、周爰執事。,"He encouraged the people and settled them;Here on the left, there on the right.He divided the ground into larger tracts and smaller portions;He dug the ditches; he defined the acres;From the west to the east,There was nothing which he did not take in hand."

捄之陾陾、度之薨薨、築之登登、削屢馮馮、百堵皆興、鼛鼓弗勝。,"Crowds brought the earth in basketsThey threw it with shouts into the frames;They beat it with responsive blows;They pared the walls repeatedly, and they sounded strong.Five thousand cubits of them arose together,So that the roll of the great drum did not overpower [the noise of the builders]."
迺立臯門、臯門有伉。迺立應門、應門將將。迺立冢土、戎醜攸行。,"They set up the gate of the enceinte;And the gate of the enceinte stood high.They set up the court gate;And the court gate stood grand.They reared the great altar [to the Spirits of the land],From which all great movements should proceed."
肆不殄厥慍、亦不隕厥問。柞棫拔矣、行道兌矣。混夷駾矣、維其喙矣。,"Thus though he could nto prevent the rage [of his foes],He did not let fall his own fame.The oaks and the Yu were [gradually] thinned,And roads for travelling were opened.The hordes of the Hun disappeared,Startled and panting."
