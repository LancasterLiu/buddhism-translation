天生烝民、有物有則。民之秉彝、好是懿德。天監有周、昭假于下、保茲天子、生仲山甫。,"Heaven, in giving birth to the multitudes of the people,To every faculty and relationship annexed its law.The people possess this normal nature,And they [consequently] love its normal virtue.Heaven beheld the ruler of Zhou,Brilliantly affecting it by his conduct below;And to maintain him, its Son,Gave birth to Zhong Shan-fu."
仲山甫之德、柔嘉維則。令儀令色、小心翼翼。古訓是式、威儀是力、天子是若、明命使賦。,"The virtue of Zhong Shan-fu,Is mild and admirable, according as it ought to be.Good is his deportment; good his looks;The lessons of antiquity are his law;He is strenuously attentive to his deportment.In full accord with the Son of Heaven,He is employed to spread abroad his bright decrees."
王命仲山甫、式是百辟。纘戎祖考、王躬是保。出納王命、王之喉舌。賦政于外、四方爰發。,"The king gave charge to Zhong Shan-fu:'Be a pattern to all the princes;Continue [the services of] your ancestors.You have to protect the royal person;Give out the royal decrees, and report on them.Be the king's throat and tongue;Spread his government abroad,So that in all quarters it shall be responded to. '"
肅肅王命、仲山甫將之。邦國若否、仲山甫明之。既明且哲、以保其身。夙夜匪解、以事一人。,"Most dignified was the king's charge,And Zhong Shan-fu carries it into execution.In the States, the princes, be they good or bad,Are clearly distinguished by Zhong Shan-fu.Intelligent is he and wise,Protecting his own person;Never idle, day or night,In the service of the One man."
人亦有言、柔則茹之、剛則吐之。維仲山甫、柔亦不茹、剛亦不吐、不侮矜寡、不畏疆禦。,"The people have a saying:'The soft is devoured,And the hard is ejected from the mouth. 'But Zhong Shan-fu,Does not devour the soft,Nor eject the powerful.He does not insult the poor or the widow;He does not fear the strong or the oppressive."
人亦有言、德輶如毛、民鮮克舉之。我儀圖之、維仲山甫舉之、愛莫助之。袞職有闕、維仲山甫補之。,"The people have a saying:'Virtue is light as a hair,But few are able to lift it. 'When I think of the matter,It is only Zhong Shan-fu that can lift it.I love him, but can do nothing to help him.Any defects in the king's duties,Are supplied by Zhong Shan-fu."
仲山甫出祖、四牡業業、征夫捷捷、每懷靡及。四牡彭彭、八鸞鏘鏘。王命仲山甫、城彼東方。,"Zhong Shan-fu went forth, having sacrificed to the Spirit of the road.His four steeds were strong;His men were alert;He was always anxious lest he should not be equal to his commission;His steeds went on without stopping,To the tinkling of their eight bells.The king had given charge to Zhong Shan-fu,To fortify the city there in the east."
四牡騤騤、八鸞喈喈。仲山甫徂齊、式遄其歸。吉甫作誦、穆如清風。仲山甫永懷、以慰其心。,"With his four steeds so strong,And their eight bells, all tinkling,Zhong Shan-fu proceeded to Qi; -And he will soon return.I, Yin Ji-fu, have made this song:May it enter like a quiet wind,Among the constant anxieties of Zhong Shan-fu,To soothe his mind!"
