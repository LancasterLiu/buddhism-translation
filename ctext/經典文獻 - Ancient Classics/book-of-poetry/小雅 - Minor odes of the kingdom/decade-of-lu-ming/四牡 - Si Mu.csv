四牡騑騑、周道倭遲。豈不懷歸、王事靡盬、我心傷悲。,My four steeds advanced without stopping;The way from Zhou was winding and tedious.Did I not have the wish to return?But the king's business was not to be slackly performed;And my heart was wounded with sadness.
四牡騑騑、嘽嘽駱馬。豈不懷歸、王事靡盬、不遑啟處。,"My four steeds advanced without stopping;They panted and snorted, the white steeds black-maned.Did I not have the wish to return?But the king's business was not to be slackly performed;And I had not leisure to kneel or to sit."
翩翩者鵻、載飛載下、集于苞栩。王事靡盬、不遑將父。,"The Filial doves keep flying about,Now soaring aloft, and now descending,Collecting on the bushy oaks;But the king's business was not to be slackly performed;And I had not leisure to nourish my father."
翩翩者鵻、載飛載止、集于苞杞。王事靡盬、不遑將母。,"The Filial doves keep flying about,Now flying, now stopping,Collecting on the bushy medlars;But the king's business was not to be slackly performed;And I had not leisure to nourish my mother."
駕彼四駱、載驟駸駸。豈不懷歸、是用作歌、將母來諗。,"I yoked my four white steeds, black-maned;They hurried away with speed.[But] did I not wish to return?Therefore I make this song,Announcing my wish to nourish my mother."
