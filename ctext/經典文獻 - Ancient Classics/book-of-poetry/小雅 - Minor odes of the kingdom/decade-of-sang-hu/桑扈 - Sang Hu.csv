交交桑扈、有鶯其羽。君子樂胥、受天之祜。,"They flit about, the green-beaks,With their variegated wings.To be rejoiced in are these princes!May they receive the blessing of Heaven!"
交交桑扈、有鶯其領。君子樂胥、萬邦之屏。,"They flit about, the green-beaks,With their glancing necks.To be rejoiced in are these princes!They are screens to all the States."
之屏之翰、百辟為憲。不戢不難、受福不那。,"These screens, these buttresses, -All the chiefs will take them as a pattern.Are they not self-restrained? Are they not careful?Will they not receive much happiness?"
兕觥其觩、旨酒思柔。彼交匪敖、萬福來求。,"How long is that cup of rhinoceros' horn!Good are the spirits in it and soft.While it passes round, they show no pride;All blessing must come to seek them."
