苕之華、其葉青青。知我如此、不如無生。,"The flowers of the bignonia [are gone],[There are only] its leaves all-green.If I had known it would be thus with me,I had better not have been born."
牂羊墳首、三星在罶。人可以食、鮮可以飽。,"The ewes have large heads;The Three stars are [seen] in the fish-trap.If some men can get enough to eat,Few can get their fill."
