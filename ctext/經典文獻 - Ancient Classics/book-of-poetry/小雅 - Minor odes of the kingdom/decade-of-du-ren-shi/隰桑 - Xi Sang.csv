隰桑有阿、其葉有難。既見君子、其樂如何。,"In the low, wet grounds, the mulberry trees are beautiful,And their leaves are luxuriant.When I see the princely men,How great is the pleasure!"
隰桑有阿、其葉有沃。既見君子、云何不樂。,"In the low, wet grounds, the mulberry trees are beautiful,And their leaves are glossy.When I see the princely men,How can I be other than glad?"
隰桑有阿、其葉有幽。既見君子、德音孔膠。,"In the low, wet grounds, the mulberry trees are beautiful,And their leaves are dark.When I see the princely men,Their virtuous fame draws them close [to my heart]."
心乎愛矣、遐不謂矣。中心藏之、何日忘之。,"In my heart I love them,And why should I not say so?In the core of my heart I keep them,And never will forget them."
