綿蠻黃鳥、止于丘阿。道之云遠、我勞如何。飲之食之、教之誨之、命彼後車、謂之載之。,"There is that little oriole,Resting on a bend of the mound.The way is distant,And I am very much wearied.Give me drink, give me food;Inform me, teach me;Order one of the attending carriages,And tell them to carry me."
綿蠻黃鳥、止于丘隅。豈敢憚行、畏不能趨。飲之食之、教之誨之、命彼後車、謂之載之。,"There is that little oriole,Resting on a corner of the mound.It is not that I dare to shrink from the journey,But I am afraid of not being able to go on.Give me drink, give me food;Inform me, teach me;Order one of the attending carriages,And tell them to carry me."
綿蠻黃鳥、止于丘側。豈敢憚行、畏不能極。飲之食之、教之誨之、命彼後車、謂之載之。,"There is that little oriole,Resting on the side of the mound.It is not that I dare to shrink from the journey,But I am afraid of not getting to the end of it.Give me drink, give me food;Inform me, teach me;Order one of the attending carriages,And tell them to carry me."
