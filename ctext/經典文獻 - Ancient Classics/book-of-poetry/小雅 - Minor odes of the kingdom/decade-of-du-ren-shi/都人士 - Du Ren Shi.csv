彼都人士、狐裘黃黃。其容不改、出言有章。行歸于周、萬民所望。,"Those officers of the [old] capital,With their fox-furs so yellow,Their deportment unvaryingly [correct],And their speech full of elegance! -If we could go back to [the old] Zhou,They would be admiringly looked up to by all the people."
彼都人士、臺笠緇撮。彼君子女、綢直如髮。我不見兮、我心不說。,"Those officers of the [old] capital,With their hats of Tai leaves and small black caps! -Those ladies of noble Houses.With their hair so thick and straight! -I do not see them [now],And my heart is dissatisfied."
彼都人士、充耳琇實。彼君子女、謂之尹吉。我不見兮、我心苑結。,"Those officers of the [old] capital,With their ear-plugs of xiu-stones! -Those ladies of noble Houses,Each fit to be called a Yin or a Ji! -I do not see them [now],And my heart grieves with indissoluble sorrow."
彼都人士、垂帶而厲。彼君子女、卷髮如蠆。我不見兮、言從之邁。,"Those officers of the [old] capital,With their girdles hanging elegantly down! -Those ladies of great Houses,With their [side] hair curving up like a scorpion's tail! -I do not see them [now],[If I could], I would walk along after them."
匪伊垂之、帶則有餘。匪伊卷之、髮則有旟。我不見兮、云何盱矣。,"Not that they purposely let their girdles hang down; -The girdles were naturally long.Not that they gave their hair that curve; -The hair had a natural curl.I do not see them [now],And how do I long for them!"
