宛彼鳴鳩、翰飛戾天。我心憂傷、念昔先人。明發不寐、有懷二人。,"Small is the cooing dove,But it flies aloft up to heaven.My heart is wounded with sorrow,And I think of our forefathers.When the dawn is breaking, and I cannot sleep,The thoughts in my breast are of our parents."
人之齊聖、飲酒溫克。彼昏不知、壹醉日富。各敬爾儀、天命不又。,"Men who are grave and wise,Though they drink, are mild and masters of themselves;But those who are benighted and ignorant,Are devoted to drink, and more so daily.Be careful, each of you, of your deportment; -What Heaven confers, [when once lost], is not regained."
中原有菽、庶民采之。螟蛉有子、蜾蠃負之。教誨爾子、式穀似之。,"In the midst of the plain there is pulse,And the common people gather it.The mulberry insect has young ones,And the sphex carries them away.Teach and train your sons,And they will become good as you are."
題彼脊令、載飛載鳴。我日斯邁、而月斯征。夙興夜寐、無忝爾所生。,"Look at the wagtail,Flying, and at the same time twittering.My days are advancing;Your months are going on.Rising early and going to sleep late,Do not disgrace those who gave you birth."
交交桑扈、率場啄粟。哀我填寡、宜岸宜獄。握粟出卜、自何能穀。,"The greenbeaks come and go,Pecking up grain about the stack-yard.Alas for the distressed and the solitary,Deemed fit inmates for the prisons!With a handful of grain I go out and divine,How I may be able to become good."
溫溫恭人、如集于木。惴惴小心、如臨于谷。戰戰兢兢、如履薄冰。,"We must be mild, and humble,As if we were perched on trees.We must be anxious and careful,As if we were on the brink of a valley.We must be apprehensive and cautious,As if we were treading upon thin ice."
