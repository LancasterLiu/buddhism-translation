涉彼北山、言采其杞。偕偕士子、朝夕從事。王事靡盬、憂我父母。,"I ascend that northern hill,And gather the medlars.An officer, strong and vigorous,Morning and evening I am engaged in service.The king's business is not to be slackly performed;And my parents are left in sorrow."
溥天之下、莫非王土。率土之濱、莫非王臣。大夫不均、我從事獨賢。,"Under the wide heaven,All is the king's land.Within the sea-boundaries of the land,All are the king's servants.His great officers are unfair, -Making me serve thus as if I alone were worthy."
四牡彭彭、王事傍傍。嘉我未老、鮮我方將。旅力方剛、經營四方。,"My four horses never halt;The king's business allows no rest.They praise me as not yet old;They think few like me in vigour.While the backbone retains its strength,I must plan and labour in all parts of the kingdom."
或燕燕居息、或盡瘁事國。或息偃在床、或不已于行。,"Some enjoy their ease and rest,And some are worn out in the service of the State;Some rest and loll upon their couches,And some never cease marching about."
或不知叫號、或慘慘劬勞。或棲遲偃仰、或王事鞅掌。,"Some never hear a sound,And some are cruelly toiled;Some lazily roost, on their backs looking up,And some are all-bustled in the service of the king."
或湛樂飲酒、或慘慘畏咎。或出入風議、或靡事不為。,"Some indulge long in pleasure and drinking,And some are miserable, in apprehension of blame;Some, at home and abroad, pass critical remarks,And some have everything to do."
