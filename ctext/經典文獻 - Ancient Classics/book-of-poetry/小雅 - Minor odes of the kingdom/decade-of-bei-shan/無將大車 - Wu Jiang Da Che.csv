無將大車、祇自塵兮。無思百憂、祇自疧兮。,Do not push forward a wagon; -You will only raise the dust about yourself.Do not think of all your anxieties; -You will only make yourself ill.
無將大車、維塵冥冥。無思百憂、不出于熲。,Do not push forward a wagon; -The dust will only blind you.Do not think of all your anxieties; -You will not emerge from imperfect views.
無將大車、維塵雝兮。無思百憂、祇自重兮。,Do not push forward a wagon; -The dust will only becloud you.Do not think of all your anxieties; -You will only weigh yourself down.
