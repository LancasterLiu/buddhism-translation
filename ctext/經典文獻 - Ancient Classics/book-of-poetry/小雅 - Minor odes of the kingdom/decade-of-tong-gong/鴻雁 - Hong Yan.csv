鴻雁于飛、肅肅其羽。之子于征、劬勞于野。爰及矜人、哀此鰥寡。,"The wild geese are flying about;Su-su goes the rustle of their wings.[There were] those officers engaged on the commission.Pained were we and toiled in the open fields;All were objects of pity,But alas for those wifeless and widows!"
鴻雁于飛、集于中澤。之子于垣、百堵皆作。雖則劬勞、其究安宅。,"The wild geese are flying about;And they settle in the midst of the marsh.[There were] those officers directing the rearing of the walls; -Five thousand cubits of them arose at once.Though there was pain and toil,In the end we had rest in our dwellings."
鴻雁于飛、哀鳴嗷嗷。維此哲人、謂我劬勞。維彼愚人、謂我宣驕。,"The wild geese are flying about,And melancholy is their cry of ao-ao.There were they, wise men,Who recognized our pain and toil;If they had been stupid men,They would have said we were proclaiming our insolence."
