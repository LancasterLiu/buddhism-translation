沔彼流誰、朝宗于海。鴥彼飛隼、載飛載止。嗟我兄弟、邦人諸友、莫肯念亂、誰無父母。,"In large volume, those flowing waters,Go to the court of the sea.Rapid is that flying falcon,Now soaring, now resting.Alas! among my brethren,My countrymen, my friends,No one is willing to think of the prevailing disorder;[But] who has not parents [to suffer from it]?"
沔彼流水、其流湯湯。鴥彼飛隼、載飛載揚。念彼不蹟、載起載行。心之憂矣、不可弭忘。,"In large volume, those flowing waters,Roll on their swollen flood.Rapid is that flying falcon,Now soaring, now rising higher.When I think of those lawless men,Now I rise up, now I walk about.The sorrow of my heart,Cannot be repressed nor forgotten."
鴥彼飛隼、率彼中陵。民之訛言、寧莫之懲。我友敬矣、讒言其興。,"Rapid is that flying falcon,Yet he keeps along the middle of the height.The talk of the people, -Is there no means of stopping it?If my friends would reverently [watch over themselves],Would slanderous speeches be made?"
