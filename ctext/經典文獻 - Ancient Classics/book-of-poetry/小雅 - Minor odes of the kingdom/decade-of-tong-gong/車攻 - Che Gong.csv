我車既攻、我馬既同。四牡龐龐、駕言徂東。,"Our chariots were strong,Our horses were well matched,And with four steeds [for each], sleek and large,We yoked and proceeded to the east."
田車既好、四牡孔阜。東有甫草、駕言行狩。,"Our hunting carriages were good,And their four steeds in fine condition.Eastwards were the grassy plains of Fu; -We yoked and went there to hunt."
之子于苗、選徒囂囂。建旐設旄、搏獸于敖。,"Of the officers in charge of the hunt,The voices resounded as they told off the men.They set up the banners, with ox-tails displayed,And we proceeded to pursue the chase in Ao."
駕彼四牡、四牡奕奕。赤芾金舄、會同有繹。,"With their four-horsed chariots [they came],Forming a long train,In their red knee-covers and gold-adorned slippers,Like the crowd of an occasional or a general audience."
決拾既佽、弓矢既調。射夫既同、助我舉柴。,"The bowstring thimbles and armlets were fitted on;The bows and arrows were adjusted to one another;The archers acted in unison,Helping us to rear a pile of game."
四黃既駕、兩驂不猗。不失其馳、舍矢如破。,"Of the four yellow horses of each chariot,The two outsiders inclined not to either side.No error in driving was committed,And the arrows went forth like downright blows."
蕭蕭馬鳴、悠悠旆旌。徒御不驚、大庖不盈。,"As if at their ease, the horses neighed,Long and slow moved the line of pennons and banners;The footmen and charioteers created no alarms;The great kitchen did not claim its full complement."
之子于征、有聞無聲。允矣君子、展也大成。,"So did the officers conduct this expedition,Without any clamour in the noise of it.Truly a princely man is [the king];Great indeed are his achievements!"
