蓼彼蕭斯、零露湑兮。既見君子、我心寫兮。燕笑語兮、是以有譽處兮。,"How long grows the southernwood,With the dew lying on it so bright!Now that I see my noble men,My heart is entirely satisfied.As we feast, we laugh and talk; -It is right they should have fame and prosperity!"
蓼彼蕭斯、零露瀼瀼。既見君子、為龍為光。其德不爽、壽考不忘。,"How long grows the southernwood,With the dew lying on it so abundantly!Now that I see my noble men,I appreciate their favour and their brightness.Their virtue is without taint of error; -May they live long, and not be forgotten!"
蓼彼蕭斯、零露泥泥。既見君子、孔燕豈弟。宜兄宜弟、令德壽豈。,"How high is the southernwood,All wet with the fallen dew!Now that I see my noble men,Grandly we feast, delighted and complacent.May their relations with their brothers be right!May they be happy in their excellent virtue to old age!"
蓼彼蕭斯、零露濃濃。既見君子、鞗革沖沖。和鸞雝雝、萬福攸同。,"How high is the southernwood,With the dew lying on it so richly!I have seen my noble men,With the ends of their reins hanging down,With the bells tinkling on their cross-boards and bits.May all happiness gather upon them."
