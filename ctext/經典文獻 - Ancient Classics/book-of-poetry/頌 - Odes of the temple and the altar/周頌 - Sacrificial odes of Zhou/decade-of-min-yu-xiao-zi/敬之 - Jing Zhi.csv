敬之敬之、天維顯思、命不易哉。無曰高高在上、陟降厥士、日監在茲。維予小子、不聰敬止。日就月將、學有緝熙于光明。佛時仔肩、示我顯德行。,"Let me be reverent, let me be reverent, [in attending to my duties];[The way of] Heaven is evident,And its appointment is not easily [preserved].Let me not say that It is high aloft above me.It ascends and descends about our doings;It daily inspects us wherever we are.I am [but as] a little child,Without intelligence to be reverently [attentive to my duties];But by daily progress and monthly advance,I will learn to hold fast the gleams [of knowledge], till I arrive at bright intelligence.Assist me to bear the burden [of my position],And show me how to display a virtuous conduct."
