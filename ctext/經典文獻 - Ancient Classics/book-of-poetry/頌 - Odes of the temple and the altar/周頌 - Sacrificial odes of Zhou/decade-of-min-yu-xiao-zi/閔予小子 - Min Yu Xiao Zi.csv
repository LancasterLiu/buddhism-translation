閔予小子、遭家不造、嬛嬛在疚。於乎皇考、永世克孝。念茲皇祖、陟降庭止。維予小子、夙夜敬止。於乎皇王、繼序思不忘。,"Alas for me, who am [as] a little child,On whom has devolved the unsettled State!Solitary am I and full of distress.Oh! my great Father,All thy life long, thou wast filial.Thou didst think of my great grandfather,[Seeing him, as it were,] ascending and descending in the court.I, the little child,Day and night will be so reverent.Oh! ye great kings,As your successor, I will strive not to forget you."
