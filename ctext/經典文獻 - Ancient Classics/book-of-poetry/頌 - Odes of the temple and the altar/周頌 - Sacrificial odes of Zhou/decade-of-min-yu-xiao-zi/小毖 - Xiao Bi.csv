予其懲 。而毖後患。莫予荓蜂。自求辛螫。肇允彼桃蟲。拚飛維鳥。未堪家多難。予又集于蓼。,"I condemn myself [for the past], and will be on my guard against future calamity.I will have nothing to do with a wasp,To seek for myself its painful sting.At first, indeed, the thing seemed but a wren,But it took wing and became a [large] bird.I am unequal to the many difficulties of the kingdom;And I am placed in the midst of bitter experiences."
