時邁其邦、昊天其子之。實右序有周。薄言震之、莫不震疊。懷柔百神、及河喬嶽。允王維后。明昭有周、式序在位。載戢干戈、載櫜弓矢。我求懿德、肆于時夏。允王保之。,"Now is he making a progress through the States,May Heaven accept him as its Son!Truly are the honour and succession come from it to the House of Zhou.To his movements,All respond with tremulous awe.He has attracted and given rest to all spiritual Beings,Even to [the Spirits of] the He, and the highest hills.Truly is the king the sovereign Lord.Brilliant and illustrious is the House of Zhou.He has regulated the positions of the princes;He has called in shields and spears;He has returned to their cases bows and arrows.I will cultivate admirable virtue,And display it throughout these great regions:Truly will the king preserve the appointment."
