烈文辟公、錫茲祉福。惠我無疆、子孫保之。無封靡于爾邦、維王其崇之。念茲戎功、繼序其皇之。無競維人、四方其訓之。不顯維德、百辟其刑之。於乎前王不忘。,"Ye, brilliant and accomplished princess,Have conferred on me this happiness.Your favours to me are without limit,And my descendants will preserve [the fruits of] them.Be not mercenary nor extravagant in your States,And the king will honour you.Thinking of this great service,He will enlarge the dignity of your successors.What is most powerful is the being the man; -Its influence will be felt throughout your States.What is most distinguished is being virtuous; -It will secure the imitation of all the princes.Ah! the former kings are not forgotten!"
