嗟嗟臣工、敬爾在公。王釐爾成、來咨來茹。嗟嗟保介、維莫之春、亦又何求、如何新畬。於皇來牟、將受厥明。明昭上帝、迄用康年。命我眾人、庤乃錢鎛、奄觀銍艾。,"Ah! Ah! ministers and officers,Reverently attend to your public duties.The king has given you perfect rules; -Consult about them and consider them.Ah! Ah! ye assistants,It is now the end of spring;And what have ye to seek for?[Only] how to manage the new fields and those of the third year.How beautiful are the wheat and the barley,Whose bright produce we shall receive!The bright and glorious God.Will in them give us a good year.Order all our men,To be provided with their spuds and hoes:Anon we shall see the sickles at work."
