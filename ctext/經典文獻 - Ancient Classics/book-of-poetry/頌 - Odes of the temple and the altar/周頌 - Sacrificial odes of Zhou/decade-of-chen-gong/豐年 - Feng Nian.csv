豐年多黍多稌。亦有高廩、萬億及秭。為酒為醴、烝畀祖妣、以洽百禮。降福孔皆。,"Abundant is the year, with much millet and much rice;And we have our high granaries,With myriads, and hundreds of thousands, and millions [of measures in them];For spirits and sweet spirits,To present to our ancestors, male and female,And to supply all out ceremonies.The blessings sent down on us are of every kind."
