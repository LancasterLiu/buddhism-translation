有客有客、亦白其馬。有萋有且、敦琢其旅。有客宿宿、有客信信。言授之縶、以縶其馬。薄言追之、左右綏之。既有淫威、降福孔夷。,"The noble visitor! The noble visitor!Drawn like his ancestors by white horses!The revered and dignified,Polished members of his suite!The noble guest will stop [but] a night or two!The noble guest will stop [but] two nights or four!Give him ropes,To bind his horses.I will convoy him [with a parting feast];I will comfort him in every possible way.Adorned with such great dignity,It is very natural that he should be blessed."
