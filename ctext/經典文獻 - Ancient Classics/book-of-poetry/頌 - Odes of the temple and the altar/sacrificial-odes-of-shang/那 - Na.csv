猗與那與、置我鞉鼓。奏鼓簡簡、衎我烈祖。湯孫奏假、綏我思成。鞉鼓淵淵、嘒嘒管聲。既和且平、依我磬聲。於赫湯孫、穆穆厥聲。庸鼓有斁、萬舞有奕。我有嘉客、亦不夷懌。自古在昔、先民有作。溫恭朝夕、執事有恪。顧予烝嘗、湯孫之將。,"How admirable! how complete!Here are set our hand-drums and drums.The drums resound harmonious and loud,To delight our meritorious ancestor.The descendant of Tang invites him with this music,That he may soothe us with the realization of our thoughts.Deep is the sound of the hand-drums and drums;Shrilly sound the flutes;All harmonious and blending together,According to the notes of the sonorous gem.Oh! majestic is the descendant of Tang;Very admirable is his music.The large bells and drums fill the ear;The various dances are grandly performed.We have admirable visitors,Who are pleased and delighted.From of old, before our time,The former men set us the example; -How to be mild and humble from morning to night,And to be reverent in discharging the service.May he regard our sacrifices in summer and autumn,[Thus] offered by the descendant of Tang!"
