玄王桓撥、受小國是達、受大國是達。率履不越、遂視既發。相土烈烈、海外有截。,"The dark king exercised an effective sway.Charged with a small State, he commanded success;Charged with a large State, he commanded success.He followed his rules of conduct without error;Wherever he inspected [the people], they responded [to his instructions].[Then came] Xiang-tu, all-ardent,And all [within] the seas, beyond [the middle region], acknowledged his restraints."
帝命不違、至于湯齊。湯降不遲、聖敬日躋。昭假遲遲、上帝是祗、帝命式于九圍。,"The favour of God did not leave [Shang],And in Tang was found the subject for its display.Tang was not born too late,And his wisdom and virtue daily advanced.Brilliant was the influence of his character [on Heaven] for long,And God appointed him to be a model to the nine regions."
受小球大球、為下國綴旒。何天之休、不競不絿、不剛不柔、敷政優優、百祿是遒。,"He received the rank-tokens [of the States], small and large,Which depended on him, like the pendants of a banner; -So did he receive the blessing of Heaven.He was neither violent nor remiss,Neither hard nor soft.Gently he spread his instructions abroad,And all dignities and riches were concentrated in him."
受小共大共、為下國駿厖。何天之龍、敷奏其勇、不震不動、不戁不竦、百祿是總。,"He received the tribute [of the States], large and small,And he supported them as a strong steed [does its burden]; -So did he receive the favour of Heaven.He displayed everywhere his valour,Unshaken, unmoved,Unterrified, unscared:All dignities were united in him."
武王載旆、有虔秉鉞。如火烈烈、則莫我敢曷。苞有三蘗、莫遂莫達、九有有截。韋顧既伐、昆吾夏桀。,"The martial king displayed his banner,And with reverence grasped his axe.It was like [the case of] a blazing fire,Which no one can repress.The root, with its three shoots,Could make no progress, no growth.The nine regions were effectually secured by him.Having smitten [the princes of] Wei and Gu,He dealt with [the prince of] Kun-wu, and with Jie of Xia."
昔在中葉、有震且業。允也天子、降予卿士、實維阿衡、實左右商王。,"Formerly in the middle of the period [before Tang],There was a time of shaking and peril,But truly did Heaven [then] deal with him as its son,And sent him down a minister,Namely A-heng,Who gave his assistance to the king of Shang."
