天命玄鳥、降而生商、宅殷土芒芒。古帝命武湯、正域彼四方。方命厥后、奄有九有。商之先后、受命不殆、在武丁孫子。武丁孫子、武王靡不勝。龍旂十乘、大糦是承。邦畿千里、維民所止、肇域彼四海。四海來假、來假祁祁、景員維河。殷受命咸宜、百祿是何。,"Heaven commissioned the swallow,To descend and give birth to [the father of our] Shang.[His descendants] dwelt in the land of Yin, and became great.[Then] long ago God appointed the martial Tang,To regulate the boundaries throughout the four quarters.[In those] quarters he appointed the princes,And grandly possessed the nine regions [of the kingdom].The first sovereign of Shang,Received the appointment without any element of instability in it,And it is [now] held by the descendant of Wu-ding.The descendant of Wu-ding,Is a martial king, equal to every emergency.Ten princes, [who came] with their dragon-emblazoned banners,Bear the large dishes of millet.The royal domain of a thousand li,Is where the people rest;But there commence the boundaries that reach to the four seas.From the four seas they come [to out sacrifices];They come in multitudes; -Jing has the He for its outer border.That Yin should have received the apppointment [of Heaven] was entirely right; -[Its sovereign] sustains all its dignities."
