地上有水，比；先王以建萬國，親諸侯。,"(The trigram representing) the earth, and over it (that representing) water, form Bi. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, established the various states and maintained an affectionate relation to their princes."
比之初六，有他吉也。,"From 'the seeking union with its object' shown in the first SIX, (divided),there will be other advantages."
比之自內，不自失也。,'The movement towards union and attachment proceeds from the inward (mind):' - (the party concerned) does not fail in what is proper to himself
比之匪人，不亦傷乎！,'Union is sought with such as ought not to be associated with:' - but will not injury be the result?
外比於賢，以從上也。,"'Union is sought (by the party intended here) with one beyond himself, and (in this case) with a worthy object:' - he is following (the ruler) above him."
顯比之吉，位正中也。舍逆取順，失前禽也。邑人不誡，上使中也。,"'The good fortune belonging to the most illustrious instance of seeking union and attachment' appears in the correct and central position (of the fifth line, undivided). (The king's) neglecting (the animals) confronting him (and then fleeing), and (only) taking those who present themselves as it were obediently, is seen in his allowing the escape of those in front of him.' 'That the people of his towns do not warn one another (to prevent such escape),' shows how he, in his high eminence, has made them pursue the due course."
比之无首，无所終也。,'He seeks union and attachment without taking the first (step to such an end):' - there is no possibility of a (good) issue.
