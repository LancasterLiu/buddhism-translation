剝：不利有攸往。,Bo indicates that (in the state which it symbolises) it will not be advantageous to make a movement in any direction whatever.
剝，剝也，柔變剛也。不利有攸往，小人長也。順而止之，觀象也。君子尚消息盈虛，天行也。,"Bo denotes overthrowing or being overthrown. We see (in the figure) the weak lines (threatening to) change the (last) strong line (into one of themselves). That 'it will not be advantageous to make a movement in any direction whatever' appears from the fact that the small men are (now) growing and increasing. The superior man acts according to (the exigency of the time), and stops all forward movement, looking at the (significance of the) symbolic figures (in the hexagram). He values the processes of decrease and increase, of fulness and decadence, (as seen) in the movements of the heavenly bodies."
山附地上，剝；上以厚下，安宅。,"(The trigrams representing) the earth, and (above it) that for a mountain, which adheres to the earth, form Bo. Superiors, in accordance with this, seek to strengthen those below them, to secure the peace and stability of their own position."

六三：剝之，无咎。,"The third SIX, divided, shows its subject among the overthrowers; but there will be no error."
剝之无咎，失上下也。,That 'there will be no error on the part of this one among the overthrowers' arises from the difference between him and the others above and below.
