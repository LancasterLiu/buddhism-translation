困，剛掩也。險以說，困而不失其所，亨；其唯君子乎？貞大人吉，以剛中也。有言不信，尚口乃窮也。,"In Kun (we see) the strong (lines) covered and obscured (by the weak). We have in it (the attribute of) perilousness going on to that of satisfaction. Who is it but the superior man that, though straitened, still does not fail in making progress to his proper end? 'For the firm and correct, the (really) great man, there will be good fortune:' - this is shown by the central positions of the strong (lines). 'If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good:' - to be fond of arguing or pleading is the way to be reduced to extremity."
