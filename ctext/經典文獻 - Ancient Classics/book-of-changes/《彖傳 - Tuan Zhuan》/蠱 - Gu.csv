蠱，剛上而柔下，巽而止，蠱。蠱，元亨，而天下治也。利涉大川，往有事也。先甲三日，後甲三日，終則有始，天行也。,"In Gu we have the strong (trigram) above, and the weak one below; we have (below) pliancy, and (above) stopping: - these give the idea of Gu (a Troublous Condition of affairs verging to ruin). 'Gu indicates great progress and success:' - (through the course shown in it), all under heaven, there will be good order. 'There will be advantage in crossing the great stream:' - he who advances will encounter the business to be done. '(He should weigh well, however, the events of) three days before (the turning-point), and those (to be done) three days after it:' - the end (of confusion) is the beginning (of order); such is the procedure of Heaven."
