震，亨。震來虩虩，恐致福也。笑言啞啞，後有則也。震驚百里，驚遠而懼邇也。出可以守宗廟社稷，以為祭主也。,"Zhen (gives the intimation of) ease and development. 'When the (time of) movement (which it indicates) comes, (its subject) will be found looking out with apprehension:' - that feeling of dread leads to happiness. 'And yet smiling and talking cheerfully:' - the issue (of his dread) is that he adopts (proper) laws (for his course). 'The movement (like a crash of thunder) terrifies all within a hundred Lu:' - it startles the distant and frightens the near. 'He will be like the sincere worshipper, who is not startled into letting go his ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits:' - he makes his appearance, and maintains his ancestral temple and the altars of the spirits of the land and grain, as presiding at all sacrifices."
