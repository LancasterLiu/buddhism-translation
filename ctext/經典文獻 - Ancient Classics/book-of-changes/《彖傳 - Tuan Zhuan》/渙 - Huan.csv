渙，亨。剛來而不窮，柔得位乎外而上同。王假有廟，王乃在中也。利涉大川，乘木有功也。,"'Huan intimates that there will be progress and success:' - (we see) the strong line (in the second place) of the lower trigram, and not suffering any extinction there; and (also) the weak line occupying its place in the outer trigram, and uniting (its action) with that of the line above. 'The king goes to his ancestral temple:' - the king's (mind) is without any deflection. 'It will be advantageous to cross the great stream:' - (the subject of the hexagram) rides in (a vessel of) wood (over water), and will do so with success."
