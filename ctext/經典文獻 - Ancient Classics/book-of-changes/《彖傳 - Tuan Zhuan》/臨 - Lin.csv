臨，剛浸而長。說而順，剛中而應，大亨以正，天之道也。至于八月有凶，消不久也。,"In Lin (we see) the strong (lines) gradually increasing and advancing. (The lower trigram is the symbol of) being pleased, and (the upper of) being compliant. The strong (line) is in the central position, and is properly responded to. 'There is great progress and success, along with firm correctness:' - this is the way of Heaven. 'In the eighth month there will be evil:' - (the advancing power) will decay after no long time."
