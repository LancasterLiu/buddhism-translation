隨，剛來而下柔，動而說，隨。大亨貞，无咎，而天下隨時，隨時之義大矣哉！,In Sui we see the strong (trigram) come and place itself under the weak; we see (in the two) the attributes of movement and pleasure: - this gives (the idea of) Sui. 'There will be great progress and success; and through firm correctness no error:' - all under heaven will be found following at such a time. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Sui.
