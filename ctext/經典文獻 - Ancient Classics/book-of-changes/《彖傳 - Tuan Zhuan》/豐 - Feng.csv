豐，大也。明以動，故丰。王假之，尚大也。勿憂宜日中，宜照天下也。日中則昃，月盈則食，天地盈虛，與時消息，而況人於人乎？況於鬼神乎？,"Feng has the signification of being great. It is made up of the trigrams (representing) intelligence and movement directed by that intelligence. It is thus that it has that signification. 'The king has reached the condition (denoted by Feng):' - he has still to make it greater. 'There is no occasion to be anxious. Let him be as the sun at noon:' - it is for him to cause his light to shine on all under the sky. When the sun has reached the meridian height, it begins to decline. When the moon has become full, it begins to wane. The (interaction of) heaven and earth is now vigorous and abundant, now dull and scanty, growing and diminishing according to the seasons. How much more must it be so with (the operations of) men! How much more also with the spiritual agency!"
