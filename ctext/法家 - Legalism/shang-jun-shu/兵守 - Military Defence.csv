四戰之國，貴守戰；負海之國，貴攻戰。四戰之國，好舉興兵，以距四鄰者，國危。四鄰之國一興事，而己四興軍，故曰國危。四戰之國，不能以萬室之邑舍鉅萬之軍者，其國危。故曰：四戰之國，務在守戰。,"A state that has to fight on four fronts values defence, and a state that rests against the sea values attack. For, if a state that fights on four fronts is fond of raising soldiers, it will be in a dangerous position, as it has to resist four neighbours. As soon as a country with four neighbours begins hostilities, four countries mobilize armies; therefore is it said that the country is in a dangerous position. If a state that has to fight on four fronts is unable to raise, from a city of ten thousand houses, an army of more than ten thousand men, then the state will be in a dangerous position. Therefore is it said: 'A state that has to fight on four fronts should concern itself with defensive warfare.'"
守有城之邑，不如以死人之力，與客生力戰。其城難拔者，死人之力也；客不盡夷城，客無從入；此謂以死人之力與客生力戰。城盡夷，客若有從入，則客必罷，中人必佚矣。以佚力與罷力戰，此謂以生人力與客死力戰。皆曰圍城之患，患無不盡死而邑。此三者非患不足，將之過也。,"In defending walled cities, the best way is, with the strength of the worn-out men, to fight the fresh strength of the invaders. It is assaults upon walled cities that wear out the strength of men. So long as the walled cities have not all been razed, the invaders have no means of penetrating the country. This is meant by the saying that the strength of worn-out men should fight the fresh strength of the invading force. But when the walled cities have all been razed and the foreign army thus finds the means of penetrating, then certainly it will be exhausted, and the people within the country will be rested. Fighting with rested strength against those of exhausted strength is said to be: fighting with the strength of fresh men against the worn-out strength of the invading forces. All these are called the misfortunes attendant upon the besieging of walled cities. It is regarded as a misfortune that always, in capturing cities, the strength of the army is worn out. In these three things misfortune is due, not to insufficient effort, but to mistaken generalship."
守城之道，盛力也。故曰客，治簿檄，三軍之多，分以客之候車之數。三軍：壯男為一軍，壯女為一軍，男女之老弱者為一軍，此之謂三軍也。壯男之軍，使盛食厲兵，陳而待敵。壯女之軍，使盛食負壘，陳而待令。客至而作土以為險阻及柞格阱陷，發梁徹屋，給徙，徙之；不給而熯之，使客無得以助攻備。老弱之軍，使牧牛馬羊彘；草水之可食者，收而食之，以獲其壯男女之食。而慎使三軍無相過。壯男過壯女之軍，則男貴女，而姦民有從謀而國亡；喜與其恐，有蚤聞，勇民不戰。壯男壯女過老弱之軍，則老使壯悲，弱使強憐，悲憐在心，則使勇民更慮，而怯民不戰。故曰慎使三軍無相過，此盛力之道。,"The way to hold a city is to have abundant strength. Therefore is it said: 'When the invading force musters its levies, mobilize as many as three armies, and divide them according to the number of the chariots of the invading force.' Of these three armies, one should be formed of able-bodied men, one of able-bodied women, and one of the old and feeble men and women. These are called the three armies. Cause the army of able-bodied men, with abundant provisions and sharp weapons, to marshal themselves and to await the enemy; cause the able-bodied women, with abundant provisions and ramparts at their backs, to marshal themselves and to await orders, so as to make, at the approach of the invaders, earthworks as an obstruction, and traps, chevaux-de-frise and pitfalls, to pull down the supporting beams and to tear down the houses, to transport what is transportable, and to burn what is untransportable, so that the invaders are not able to make use thereof in their attack. Cause the army of the old and feeble to guard the oxen, horses, sheep and swine, and to collect all that is consumable of plants and water, to feed them therewith, so as to obtain food for the able-bodied men and women. But see to it carefully that the three armies do not intermingle. If the ablebodied men mingle with the army of the able-bodied women, they will attach great value to the safety of the women, and wicked people will have opportunities for intrigue, with the result that the state will perish. Taking pleasure in the women's company, the men will be afraid of disturbing reports and so not even the brave will fight. If the able-bodied men and women intermingle with the army of the old and feeble, then the old will arouse the compassion of the able-bodied, and the feeble the pity of the strong. Compassion and pity in the heart cause brave people to be more anxious and fearful people not to fight. Therefore is it said: 'See to it carefully that the three armies do not intermingle.' This is the way to have abundant strength."
