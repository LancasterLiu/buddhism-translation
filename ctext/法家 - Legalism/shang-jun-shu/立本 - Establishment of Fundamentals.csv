凡用兵，勝有三等：若兵未起而錯法，錯法而俗成，俗成而用具。此三者必行於境內，而後兵可出也。行三者有二勢：一曰輔法而法行；二曰舉必得而法立。故恃其眾者謂之葺，恃其備飾者謂之巧，恃譽目者謂之詐。此三者恃一，因其兵可禽也。故曰強者必剛其鬥意：鬥則力盡，力盡則備。是故無敵於海內。治行則貨積，貨積則賞能重矣。賞壹則爵尊，爵尊則賞能利矣。故曰：兵生於治而異，俗生於法而萬轉，過勢本於心而飾於備勢。三者有論，故強可立也。是以強者必治，治者必強；富者必治，治者必富；強者必富，富者必強。故曰治強之道三，論其本也。,"Generally, in the utilizing of soldiers, there are three stages to victory: prior to the outbreak of hostilities, laws should be fixed (764); laws being fixed, they should become the custom; when they have become customary, supplies should be provided. These three things should be done within the country before the soldiers can be sent abroad. For performing these three things, there are two conditions; the first is to support the law, so that it can be applied; the second is to obtain the right men in appointments, so that the law can be established. For reliance on masses is said to be the assembling of a mob; reliance on outward appearances is said to be smartness; reliance on fame and sight is said to be deceitfulness. If one relies on any one of these three, one's soldiers may be captured. Therefore is it said: 'The strong are unbending; they fight for what they desire. By fighting, their strength develops to the full, and thus they are prepared. In this way, they have no rival in the four seas, and by order prevailing, products are accumulated; by the accumulation of products, it is possible for the rewards to be big.' If rewards are uniform, rank will be honoured; if rank is honoured, rewards will bring profit. Therefore is it said: 'The army, being based on a state of order, there is a marvellous result; custom, being based on law, ten thousand changes of circumstances are brought about; a condition of supremacy, being based upon the mind, it is outwardly manifested in a condition of preparedness. If these three points of view are all taken into consideration, the result will be that the strong may be firmly established.' Thus orderly government is the necessary result of strength, and strength again of orderly government; orderly government of riches, and riches again of orderly government; riches of strength, and strength again of riches. Therefore is it said: 'The way to orderly government and strength is to discuss fundamentals.'"
